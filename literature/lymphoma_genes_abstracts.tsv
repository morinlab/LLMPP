35255429	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2021.151886	De Novo CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A genomic profiling study and prognostic analysis of 46 patients.	We reported 46 cases of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma which abnormally expressed CD5 protein (De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL), which had attracted researcher's attention for a period of time for its poor prognosis. However, there were few studies on its molecular change. In the present article, we summarized the genetic alterations using a lymphopanel detection method by Next Generation Sequencing(NGS). The most frequently mutated genes were MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> (20/46, 43.5%), followed by PIMI (19/46, 41.3%), IGLL5 (13/46, 28.3%)and CD79B (11/46, 23.9%). We further investigated the relationship between gene alterations and prognosis using OS(Overall survival) and PFS(Progression-free survival). MYD88, CREBBP, and ACTB mutation were significantly associated with inferior OS (P = 0.032, 0.000, 0.001), PIMI, CREBBP, ACTB and CXCR4 mutation were significantly associated with inferior PFS (P = 0.016, 0.001, 0.045, 0.024). Meanwhile, we found that De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL had BCL-6(9/46,19.6%), C-MYC (4/46, 8.7%) and IRF4 (2/19, 10.5%) rearrangement, but without BCL-2 rearrangement, there were no significantly associations with prognosis. In summary, our research explored the gene alterations of De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL in a relatively large scale for the first time, the most common gene mutation was MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> which was also a potential prognostic factor, providing a potential therapeutic target for the patients of De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL.	2022	05	23	Ann Diagn Pathol	Fan	Yue
35344115	10.1007/s11033-022-07337-w	Identification and validation of suitable housekeeping genes for gene expression studies in BCR-ABL1 positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The stability of the housekeeping gene (HKG) expression is an absolute prerequisite for accurate normalization of target gene expression in a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). In RQ-PCR, the widely used normalization approach involves the standardization of target genes to the most stable HKG control genes. According to the recent literature, in different experimental conditions the HKGs exhibit either up or down-regulation and thus affecting the gene expression profiles of target genes which leads to erroneous results. This implies that it is very important to select the appropriate HKG and verify the expression stability of the HKG before quantification of the target gene. The present study aims to analyze six different HKGs for their expression profiles and stability in BCR-ABL1 negative cases and validate them in BCR-ABL1 positive cases, detected by multiplex reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Six commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ABL1, RNA18S, ACTB, GUSB, and EEF2) were selected in this study. RQ-PCR was performed on 24 BCR-ABL1 negative cases and the outcomes were validated on 24 BCR-ABL1 positive cases. RefFinder™, a web-based composite software was used to check the stability of HKG genes by different algorithms and comprehensive ranking of each HKG gene in BCR-ABL1 negative cases and finally validated in BCR-ABL1 positive cases. It was found that RNA18S, ABL1 and GUSB are good stable HKG genes, which showed minimum variability in gene expression compared to GAPDH, EEF2, and ACTB, the most commonly used HKG.	2022	07	12	Mol Biol Rep	Gupta	Dikshat Gopal
35765478	10.14202/vetworld.2022.1333-1340	Investigation of proteomic profiles in canine lymphoma using tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics approach.	Specific tumor biomarkers are useful for the early diagnosis of cancer or can predict the recurrence of neoplastic disease in humans and animals. Lymphoma in dogs could be classified into B-, T-, and NK-cell origins. T-cell lymphoma has the worst prognosis with a shorter survival time and disease-free interval. This study aimed to identify the differential serum protein expressions of canine B- and T-cell lymphomas compared with healthy dogs using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Serum samples were collected from 20 untreated canine lymphomas (14 B-cells and 6 T-cells) and four healthy control dogs. Sera peptides from each sample were processed for TMT 10-plex tagging and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS). Differential proteome profiling was then compared between lymphoma and control. We discovered 20 elevated and 14 decreased serum proteins in the lymphoma group relative to the healthy group. Six candidate increased proteins in canine lymphomas were beta-actin cytoplasmic 1 (ACTB, p=0.04), haptoglobin (p=0.002), beta-2 microglobulin (aaaaaaaa2M, p=0.007), beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (APOH, p=0.03), metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1, p=0.03), and CD44 antigen (p=0.02). When compared between B- and T-cell lymphomas, B-cell phenotypes had upregulated immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain V region GOM (p=0.02), clusterin (p=0.01), apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1, p=0.05), and plasminogen (p=0.02). These findings were investigated quantitative serum proteomes between B- and T-cell lymphomas using TMT-based MS. ACTB, aaaaaaaa2M, APOH, TIMP-1, CD44 antigen, Ig heavy chain V region GOM, and APOC1 are novel candidate proteins and might serve as a lymphoma biomarker in dogs. However, evaluation with an increased sample size is needed to confirm their diagnostic and prognostic ability.	2022	07	16	Vet World	Fonghem	Piyanoot
33404293	10.1080/15548627.2020.1871204	BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy is required for mitochondrial remodeling during the differentiation of optic nerve oligodendrocytes.	Retinal ganglion cell axons are heavily myelinated (98%) and myelin damage in the optic nerve (ON) severely affects vision. Understanding the molecular mechanism of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes will be essential for developing new therapeutic approaches for ON demyelinating diseases. To this end, we developed a new method for isolation and culture of ON-derived oligodendrocyte lineage cells and used it to study OPC differentiation. A critical aspect of cellular differentiation is macroautophagy/autophagy, a catabolic process that allows for cell remodeling by degradation of excess or damaged cellular molecules and organelles. Knockdown of ATG9A and BECN1 (pro-autophagic proteins involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation) led to a significant reduction in proliferation and survival of OPCs. We also found that autophagy flux (a measure of autophagic degradation activity) is significantly increased during progression of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant change in mitochondrial dynamics during oligodendrocyte differentiation, which is associated with a significant increase in programmed mitophagy (selective autophagic clearance of mitochondria). This process is mediated by the mitophagy receptor BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like). BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial network formation, mitochondrial function and the viability of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes. Our studies provide novel evidence that proper mitochondrial dynamics is required for establishment of functional mitochondria in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings are significant because targeting BNIP3L-mediated programmed mitophagy may provide a novel therapeutic approach for stimulating myelin repair in ON demyelinating diseases.<b>Abbreviations:</b> A2B5: a surface antigen of oligodendrocytes precursor cells, A2B5 clone 105; ACTB: actin, beta; APC: an antibody to label mature oligodendrocytes, anti-adenomatous polyposis coli clone CC1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG9A: autophagy related 9A; AU: arbitrary units; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; BNIP3: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; CASP3: caspase 3; CNP: 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase; Ctl: control; COX8: cytochrome c oxidase subunit; CSPG4/NG2: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4; DAPI: 4'6-diamino-2-phenylindole; DNM1L: dynamin 1-like; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FIS1: fission, mitochondrial 1; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP: glial fibrillary growth factor; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HsESC: human embryonic stem cell; IEM: immunoelectron microscopy; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBP: myelin basic protein; MFN2: mitofusin 2; Mito-Keima: mitochondria-targeted monomeric keima-red; Mito-GFP: mitochondria-green fluorescent protein; Mito-RFP: mitochondria-red fluorescent protein; MitoSOX: red mitochondrial superoxide probe; MKI67: antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki 67; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; O4: oligodendrocyte marker O4; OLIG2: oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2; ON: optic nerve; OPA1: OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase; OPC: oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; PDL: poly-D-lysine; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RGC: retinal ganglion cell; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR: real time polymerase chain reaction; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOD2: superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; TUBB: tubulin, beta; TUBB3: tubulin, beta 3 class III.	2022	04	07	Autophagy	Yazdankhah	Meysam
33952317	10.1186/s13148-021-01091-9	Methylated markers accurately distinguish primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) from other CNS tumors.	Definitive diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) requires invasive surgical brain biopsy, causing treatment delays. In this paper, we identified and validated tumor-specific markers that can distinguish PCNSL from other CNS tumors in tissues. In a pilot study, we tested these newly identified markers in plasma. The Methylation Outlier Detector program was used to identify markers in TCGA dataset of 48 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 656 glioblastomas and lower-grade gliomas. Eight methylated markers clearly distinguished DLBCL from gliomas. Marker performance was verified (ROC-AUC of ≥ 0.989) in samples from several GEO datasets (95 PCNSL; 2112 other primary CNS tumors of 11 types). Next, we developed a novel, efficient assay called Tailed Amplicon Multiplexed-Methylation-Specific PCR (TAM-MSP), which uses two of the methylation markers, cg0504 and SCG3 triplexed with ACTB. FFPE tissue sections (25 cases each) of PCNSL and eight types of other primary CNS tumors were analyzed using TAM-MSP. TAM-MSP distinguished PCNSL from the other primary CNS tumors with 100% accuracy (AUC = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, P &lt; 0.001). The TAM-MSP assay also detected as few as 5 copies of fully methylated plasma DNA spiked into 0.5 ml of healthy plasma. In a pilot study of plasma from 15 PCNSL, 5 other CNS tumors and 6 healthy individuals, methylation in cg0504 and SCG3 was detectable in 3/15 PCNSL samples (20%). The Methylation Outlier Detector program identified methylated markers that distinguish PCNSL from other CNS tumors with accuracy. The high level of accuracy achieved by these markers was validated in tissues by a novel method, TAM-MSP. These studies lay a strong foundation for a liquid biopsy-based test to detect PCNSL-specific circulating tumor DNA.	2022	01	24	Clin Epigenetics	Downs	Bradley M
34598060	10.1016/j.ctarc.2021.100465	Prioritising breast cancer theranostics: A current medical longing in oncology.	The Theranostics approach has full potential to completely transform the contemporary medicine system to a patient-centric approach, as it is emerging in quite efficient manner, over the past few years. The primary impetus of this review is to analyse the patent growth in the domain of breast cancer theranostics. This wholesome analysis provides an insight into the current technological and R &amp; D advancement over the years, in breast cancer theranostics. Thus, guide the end-users in getting the conclusion for policymaking and other public recommendations. This patent assessment also foretells about the future trends to carry out further achievements. Due to their easy availability, information richness, &amp; versatility, patent's role in R&amp;D policy has been emphasized by stake holders of innovation including scientists time to time. Graphical Abstract: The figure illustrates the applied technologies used for breast cancer theranostics by top three forward cited patents (A) The oligonucleotides with specific sequences (comprised of at least one of DNA, RNA, PNA. LNA, UNA or combination)<sup>1</sup> are capable of binding a targeted tumor protein (PARP1, HISTIHIB, HISTIHID, NCL, FBL, SFPQ, RPL12, ACTB, HIST1H4A, SSBP1, NONO, H2AFJ, and DDX21, forming a tumor protein complex or subunit or their fragments and might block the tumoral activity.

34925435	10.3389/fgene.2021.677650	Genetic Landscape of Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Systemic Review and Association Analysis With Next-Generation Sequencing.	In our research, we screened 1,495 documents, compiled the whole-exome sequencing data of several studies, formed a data set including 92 observations of RRDLBCL (Relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and performed association analysis on the high-frequency mutations among them. The most common mutations in the data set include TTN, KMT2D, TP53, IGLL5, CREBBP, BCL2, MYD88, and SOCS1 etc. Among these, CREBBP, KMT2D, and BCL2 have a strong association with each other, and SOCS1 has a strong association with genes such as STAT6, ACTB, CIITA, ITPKB, and GNA13. TP53 lacks significant associations with most genes. Through SOM clustering, expression-level analysis and protein interaction analysis of common gene mutations, we believe that RRDLBCL can be divided into five main types. We tested the function of the model and described the clinical characteristics of each subtype through a targeted sequencing RRDLBCL cohort of 96 patients. The classification is stated as follows: 1) JAK-STAT-related type: including STAT6, SOCS1, CIITA, etc. The genetic lineage is similar to PMBL and cHL. Retrospective analysis suggests that this subtype responds poorly to induction therapy (R-CHOP, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). 2) BCL-CREBBP type: Epigenetic mutations such as KMT2D and CREBBP are more common in this type, and are often accompanied by BCL2 and EZH2 mutations. 3) MCD type: including MYD88 and CD79B, PIM1 is more common in this subtype. 4) TP53 mutation: TP53 mutant patients, which suggests the worst prognosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and worst response to CART treatment. 5) Undefined type (Sparse item type): Major Genetic Change Lacking Type, which has a better prognosis and better response to CART treatment. We also reviewed the literature from recent years concerning the previously mentioned common gene mutations.	2021	12	21	Front Genet	Gao	Fan
31242129	10.1080/15548627.2019.1635380	<i>MIR145-3p</i> promotes autophagy and enhances bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma by targeting <i>HDAC4</i>.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with poor survival. Autophagy, a stress-responsive catabolic process mediated by lysosomal activity, plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of MM. Growing evidence has indicated that dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with the aberrant autophagy in various human cancers. However, to date, few miRNAs have been reported to directly modulate autophagy in the pathobiology of MM. In this study, we investigated the role of <i>MIR145-3p</i> (microRNA 145-3p) in MM, with focus on cellular processes autophagy and cell death. Our results provided evidence that downregulation of <i>MIR145-3p</i> expression was associated with disease progression in human MM. <i>MIR145-3p</i> triggered autophagic flux through direct targeting of <i>HDAC4</i> (histone deacetylase 4) in MM cells, leading to enhanced apoptosis. Silencing <i>HDAC4</i> recapitulated the effects of <i>MIR145-3p</i>, whereas enforced expression of <i>HDAC4</i> abrogated the effects of <i>MIR145-3p</i>. Furthermore, we showed that suppression of <i>HDAC4</i> by <i>MIR145-3p</i> resulted in upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BCL2L11 and caused MTORC1 inactivation, which in turn led to enhanced autophagy and cell death. Importantly, we demonstrated that <i>MIR145-3p</i> mimic could potentiate the anti-MM activity of bortezomib in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. Overall, our findings indicate that <i>MIR145-3p</i> exerted a tumor suppression function in MM by inducing autophagic cell death and suggest that <i>MIR145-3p</i>-based targeted therapy would represent a novel strategy for MM treatment.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; 3'-UTR: 3'-untranslated region; 7-AAD: 7-aminoactinomycin D; ACTB: actin beta; ANXA5: annexin A5; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; B2M: beta-2-microglobulin; BAF: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BCL2L11: BCL2 like 11; Bort: bortezomib; CASP3: caspase 3; CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit-8; CQ: chloroquine; Ct: threshold cycle; ctrl: control; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HDAC4: histone deacetylase 4; ISS: International Staging System; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; miRNAs: microRNAs; <i>MIR145-3p</i>: microRNA 145-3p; MM: multiple myeloma; mRNA: messenger RNA; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; PCs: plasma cells; PFS: progression-free survival; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription PCR; RPS6KB1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SD: standard deviation; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; STV: starvation; TUBB: tubulin beta class I.	2021	06	07	Autophagy	Wu	Hongkun
32349449	10.3390/ijms21093093	Prevalence of Cytoplasmic Actin Mutations in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma: A Functional Assessment Based on Actin Three-Dimensional Structures.	Mutations in actins have been linked to several developmental diseases. Their occurrence across different cancers has, however, not been investigated. Using the cBioPortal database we show that human actins are infrequently mutated in patient samples of various cancers types. Nevertheless, ranking these studies by mutational frequency suggest that some have a higher percentage of patients with <i>ACTB</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> mutations. Within studies on hematological cancers, mutations in <i>ACTB</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> are associated with lymphoid cancers since none have currently been reported in myeloid cancers. Within the different types of lymphoid cancers <i>ACTB</i> mutations are most frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and <i>ACTG1</i> mutations in multiple myeloma. We mapped the ACTB and ACTG1 mutations found in these two cancer types on the 3D-structure of actin showing they are in regions important for actin polymer formation or binding to myosin. The potential effects of the mutations on actin properties imply that mutations in cytoplasmic actins deserve dedicated research in DLBCL and multiple myeloma.	2021	02	01	Int J Mol Sci	Witjes	Laura
32565964	10.3892/ol.2020.11552	Comprehensive characterization of driver genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common hematological malignancy and is one of the most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Large-scale genomic studies have defined genetic drivers of DLBCL and their association with functional and clinical outcomes. However, the lymphomagenesis of DLBCL is yet to be fully understood. In the present study, four computational tools OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, integrated Cancer Genome Score and Driver Genes and Pathways were used to detect driver genes and driver pathways involved in DLBCL. The aforementioned tools were also used to perform an integrative investigation of driver genes, including co-expression network, protein-protein interaction, copy number variation and survival analyses. The present study identified 208 driver genes and 31 driver pathways in DLBCL. <i>IGLL5, MLL2, BTG2, B2M, PIM1, CARD11</i> were the top five frequently mutated genes in DLBCL. <i>NOTCH3, LAMC1, COL4A1, PDGFRB</i> and <i>KDR</i> were the 5 hub genes in the blue module that were associated with patient age. <i>TP53, MYC, EGFR, PTEN, IL6, STAT3, MAPK8, TNF</i> and <i>CDH1</i> were at the core of the protein-protein interaction network. <i>PRDM1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, TNFAIP3, RSPO3</i> were the top five frequently deleted driver genes in DLBCL, while <i>ACTB, BTG2, PLET1, CARD11, DIXDC1</i> were the top five frequently amplified driver genes in DLBCL. High <i>EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA</i> and <i>RECQL4</i> expression was associated with decreased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. High <i>XPO1</i> and <i>LYN</i> expression were associated with increased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. The present study improves the understanding of the biological processes and pathways involved in lymphomagenesis. The driver genes, <i>EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA, RECQL4, XPO1</i> and <i>LYN</i>, pave the way for developing prognostic biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for DLBCL.	2020	09	28	Oncol Lett	Fan	Zheng
31108950	10.3390/genes10050376	Identification and Validation of Novel Reference Genes in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Droplet Digital PCR.	Droplet digital PCR is the most robust method for absolute nucleic acid quantification. However, RNA is a very versatile molecule and its abundance is tissue-dependent. RNA quantification is dependent on a reference control to estimate the abundance. Additionally, in cancer, many cellular processes are deregulated which consequently affects the gene expression profiles. In this work, we performed microarray data mining of different childhood cancers and healthy controls. We selected four genes that showed no gene expression variations (<i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i>) and four classical reference genes (<i>ACTB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>RPL4</i> and RPS18). Gene expression was validated in 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by means of droplet digital PCR. We observed that <i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i> were expressed ~100 times less than <i>ACTB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>RPL4</i> and <i>RPS18</i>. However, we observed excellent correlations among the new reference genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). We propose that <i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i> are housekeeping genes with low expression in childhood cancer.	2020	02	14	Genes (Basel)	Villegas-Ruíz	Vanessa
29433359	10.1080/15548627.2017.1390636	Piperlongumine restores the balance of autophagy and apoptosis by increasing BCL2 phosphorylation in rotenone-induced Parkinson disease models.	Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease and is caused by genetics, environmental factors and aging, with few treatments currently available. Apoptosis and macroautophagy/autophagy play critical roles in PD pathogenesis; as such, modulating their balance is a potential treatment strategy. BCL2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) is a key molecule regulating this balance. Piperlongumine (PLG) is an alkaloid extracted from Piper longum L. that has antiinflammatory and anticancer effects. The present study investigated the protective effects of PLG in rotenone-induced PD cell and mouse models. We found that PLG administration (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 4 wk attenuated motor deficits in mice and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra induced by oral administration of rotenone (10 mg/kg) for 6 wk. PLG improved cell viability and enhanced mitochondrial function in primary neurons and SK-N-SH cells. These protective effects were exerted via inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy through enhancement of BCL2 phosphorylation at Ser70. These results demonstrate that PLG exerts therapeutic effects in a rotenone-induced PD models by restoring the balance between apoptosis and autophagy. 6-OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine; ACTB, actin, beta; BafA1, bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BAK1, BCL2-antagonist/killer 1; BAX, BCL2-associated X protein; BCL2, B cell leukemia/lymphoma2; BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy related; CoQ10, coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>; COX4I1/COX IV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; CsA, cyclosporine A; ED50, 50% effective dose; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; JC-1, tetraethylbenz-imidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; l-dopa, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine; MAPK8/JNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NFE2L2/NRF2, nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PD, Parkinson disease; PLG, piperlongumine; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PI, propidium iodide; PtdIns3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PTX, paclitaxel; Rap, rapamycin; SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome 1; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; WIPI2, WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2; ZFYVE1/DFCP1, zinc finger, FYVE domain containing 1.	2019	10	03	Autophagy	Liu	Jia
27868373	10.1002/ajmg.a.38057	Acute myeloid leukemia in Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome.	Baraitser-Winter malformation syndrome (BWMS), Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FA), and craniofrontofacial syndromes (CFFs) have all been recently proposed to be part of the same phenotypic spectrum of Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF), which is characterized by facial dysmorphism, ocular coloboma, brain malformations, and intellectual disabilities. In addition to that, the recent discovery of missense mutations in one of the two ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic β- and γ-acting-encoding genes ACTB (7p22.1) and ACTG1 (17q25.3) in patients carrying a clinical diagnosis of BWSM, FA, or CCF has provided further evidence that these clinical conditions do indeed belong to the same entity at the molecular level. Two cases of BWCFF patients presenting with malignancies (i.e., acute lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous lymphoma) have been published thus far. Here, we report a 21-year-old female with molecularly confirmed FA, who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The present finding may indicate that actinopathies could be cancer-predisposing syndromes although small numbers and publication bias should be taken into account. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2017	10	24	Am J Med Genet A	Cianci	Paola
28807016	10.1186/s12885-017-3536-6	Endogenous controls of gene expression in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced T-cell lymphoma in p53-deficient mice.	Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an increasingly important technique for gene expression profiling because it can provide insights into complex biological and pathological processes and be used to predict disease or treatment outcomes. Although normalized data are necessary for an accurate estimation of mRNA expression levels, several pieces of evidence suggest that the expression of so-called housekeeping genes is not stable. This study aimed to validate reference genes for the normalization of real-time PCR in an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced T-cell lymphoma mouse model. T-cell lymphomas were generated in p53-deficient mice by treatment with 37.5 mg/kg MNU. Thymus and spleen were identified as the primary target organs with the highest incidences of lymphomas. We analyzed the RNA expression levels of eight potential endogenous reference genes (Gapdh, Rn18s, Actb, Hprt, B2M, Rplp0, Gusb, Ctbp1). The expression stabilities of these reference genes were tested at different time points after MNU treatment using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. A total of 65% of MNU-treated mice developed T-cell lymphomas, with the spleen and thymus as the major target organs. All candidate reference genes were amplified efficiently by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene stability evaluation after MNU treatment and during lymphomagenesis revealed that Ctbp1 and Rplp0 were the most stably expressed genes in the thymus and spleen, respectively. RT-PCR of thymus RNA using two additional sets of primer confirmed that Ctbp1 was the most stable of all the candidate reference genes. We provided suitable endogenous controls for gene expression studies in the T-cell lymphoma model.	2018	05	03	BMC Cancer	Wu	Xi
26852652	10.1016/j.bcmd.2015.11.006	ETV6/RUNX1 transcript is a target of RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The oncofetal RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 (IGF2 mRNA binding protein 1) is overexpressed in a subset of cancers and promotes cell cycle, migration and aggressive phenotype by regulating post-transcriptionally a number of key mRNAs (e. g, ACTB, CD44, CTNNB1, KRAS, MAPK4, MYC, PTEN and others). IGF2BP1 is also overexpressed in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the biological significance of this phenomenon has not been addressed so far. We have identified leukemia fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA to be highly enriched in immunoprecipitated fraction of endogenous IGF2BP1 from a model cell line REH and t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL samples. Furthermore, downregulation of IGF2BP1 by two-fold has resulted in a corresponding decrease of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA validating this transcript as a target of IGF2BP1 protein in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. These data infer that IGF2BP1 is a potent regulator of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA stability and potentially link this evolutionary-highly conserved protein to cell transformation events in ETV6/RUNX1-mediated leukemogenesis of t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. 	2016	10	25	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Stoskus	Mindaugas
25052316	10.1038/ejhg.2014.95	Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome: delineation of the spectrum in 42 cases.	Baraitser-Winter, Fryns-Aftimos and cerebrofrontofacial syndrome types 1 and 3 have recently been associated with heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in one of the two ubiquitous cytoplasmic actin-encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1 that encode β- and γ-actins. We present detailed phenotypic descriptions and neuroimaging on 36 patients analyzed by our group and six cases from the literature with a molecularly proven actinopathy (9 ACTG1 and 33 ACTB). The major clinical anomalies are striking dysmorphic facial features with hypertelorism, broad nose with large tip and prominent root, congenital non-myopathic ptosis, ridged metopic suture and arched eyebrows. Iris or retinal coloboma is present in many cases, as is sensorineural deafness. Cleft lip and palate, hallux duplex, congenital heart defects and renal tract anomalies are seen in some cases. Microcephaly may develop with time. Nearly all patients with ACTG1 mutations, and around 60% of those with ACTB mutations have some degree of pachygyria with anteroposterior severity gradient, rarely lissencephaly or neuronal heterotopia. Reduction of shoulder girdle muscle bulk and progressive joint stiffness is common. Early muscular involvement, occasionally with congenital arthrogryposis, may be present. Progressive, severe dystonia was seen in one family. Intellectual disability and epilepsy are variable in severity and largely correlate with CNS anomalies. One patient developed acute lymphocytic leukemia, and another a cutaneous lymphoma, indicating that actinopathies may be cancer-predisposing disorders. Considering the multifaceted role of actins in cell physiology, we hypothesize that some clinical manifestations may be partially mutation specific. Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome is our suggested designation for this clinical entity. 	2015	10	22	Eur J Hum Genet	Verloes	Alain
25696013		Selection of superior reference genes' combination for quantitative real-time PCR in B-cell lymphomas.	Normalization of real-time quantitative PCR data to appropriate reference genes is crucial to accurately interpret results. Many genes commonly used as reference standards do not perform as expected, depending on cell type and experimental design. In our previous work, we addressed the issue of suitable reference genes for lymphoid tissue and successfully applied the normalization factor-based approach to discriminate lymphoid malignancies according to their cyclin D1 mRNA level. Here, we addressed the problem of reference gene selection and sufficient number on an enlarged sample set with seven candidate genes. The experimental set included 165 samples of spleens, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with different types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas along with non-neoplastic lymphoid specimens. For the first time, we compared all major stability ranking algorithms of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) applets geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder and tested candidate reference genes on a large and heterogeneous set of fresh clinical lymphoid samples. We concluded that a normalization-based approach using three reference genes (YWHAZ, UBC and ACTB) allows for robust reduction of the variance in real-time PCR results and that the further addition of reference genes does not improve data normalization. This creates a clinically applicable tool for PCR-based lymphoma diagnostics. 	2015	12	15	Ann Clin Lab Sci	Potashnikova	Daria
25715028	10.1080/15548627.2015.1017191	BAX and BAK1 are dispensable for ABT-737-induced dissociation of the BCL2-BECN1 complex and autophagy.	Disruption of the complex of BECN1 with BCL2 or BCL2L1/BCL-XL is an essential switch that turns on cellular autophagy in response to environmental stress or treatment with BH3 peptidomimetics. Recently, it has been proposed that BCL2 and BCL2L1/BCL-XL may inhibit autophagy indirectly through a mechanism dependent on the proapoptotic BCL2 family members, BAX and BAK1. Here we report that the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, induces autophagy in parallel with disruption of BCL2-BECN1 binding in 2 different apoptosis-deficient cell types lacking BAX and BAK1, namely in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells and in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. We conclude that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 induces autophagy through a BAX and BAK1-independent mechanism that likely involves disruption of BECN1 binding to antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. 	2016	03	07	Autophagy	Pedro	Jose Manuel Bravo-San
25984893	10.1080/15548627.2015.1034402	The GST-BHMT assay reveals a distinct mechanism underlying proteasome inhibition-induced macroautophagy in mammalian cells.	By monitoring the fragmentation of a GST-BHMT (a protein fusion of glutathionine S-transferase N-terminal to betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase) reporter in lysosomes, the GST-BHMT assay has previously been established as an endpoint, cargo-based assay for starvation-induced autophagy that is largely nonselective. Here, we demonstrate that under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inhibition by either pharmaceutical or genetic manipulations induces similar autophagy-dependent GST-BHMT processing. However, mechanistically this proteasome inhibition-induced autophagy is different from that induced by starvation as it does not rely on regulation by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase]) and PRKAA/AMPK (protein kinase, AMP-activated, α catalytic subunit), the upstream central sensors of cellular nutrition and energy status, but requires the presence of the cargo receptors SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) and NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) that are normally involved in the selective autophagy pathway. Further, it depends on ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress signaling, in particular ERN1/IRE1 (endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1) and its main downstream effector MAPK8/JNK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 8), but not XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), by regulating the phosphorylation-dependent disassociation of BCL2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) from BECN1 (Beclin 1, autophagy related). Moreover, the multimerization domain of GST-BHMT is required for its processing in response to proteasome inhibition, in contrast to its dispensable role in starvation-induced processing. Together, these findings support a model in which under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inactivation induces autophagy-dependent processing of the GST-BHMT reporter through a distinct mechanism that bears notable similarity with the yeast Cvt (cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting) pathway, and suggest the GST-BHMT reporter might be employed as a convenient assay to study selective macroautophagy in mammalian cells. 	2016	02	23	Autophagy	Rui	Yan-Ning
26043155	10.1080/15548627.2015.1055439	TNFAIP3 promotes survival of CD4 T cells by restricting MTOR and promoting autophagy.	Autophagy plays important roles in metabolism, differentiation, and survival in T cells. TNFAIP3/A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that is thought to be a negative regulator of autophagy in cell lines. However, the role of TNFAIP3 in autophagy remains unclear. To determine whether TNFAIP3 regulates autophagy in CD4 T cells, we first analyzed Tnfaip3-deficient naïve CD4 T cells in vitro. We demonstrated that Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited reduced MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) puncta formation, increased mitochondrial content, and exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These results indicate that TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in CD4 T cells. We then investigated the mechanism by which TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy signaling. We found that TNFAIP3 bound to the MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complex and that Tnfaip3-deficient cells displayed enhanced ubiquitination of the MTOR complex and MTOR activity. To confirm the effects of enhanced MTOR activity in Tnfaip3-deficient cells, we analyzed cell survival following treatment with Torin1, an MTOR inhibitor. Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited fewer cell numbers than the control cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the impaired survival of Tnfaip3-deficient cells was ameliorated with Torin1 treatment in vitro and in vivo. The effect of Torin1 was abolished by Atg5 deficiency. Thus, enhanced MTOR activity regulates the survival of Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells. Taken together, our findings illustrate that TNFAIP3 restricts MTOR signaling and promotes autophagy, providing new insight into the manner in which MTOR and autophagy regulate survival in CD4 T cells. 	2016	04	18	Autophagy	Matsuzawa	Yu
24275555	10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.11.021	Peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure induces sex-specific programming of disease susceptibilities in adult mouse offspring.	Vulnerability of the fetus upon maternal obesity can potentially occur during all developmental phases. We aimed at elaborating longer-term health outcomes of fetal overnutrition during the earliest stages of development. We utilized Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice to induce pre-conceptional and gestational obesity and followed offspring outcomes in the absence of any postnatal obesogenic influences. Male adult offspring developed overweight, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis; all these features were not observed in females. Instead, they showed impaired fasting glucose and a reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. Influences of the interaction of maternal diet∗sex concerned offspring genes involved in fatty liver disease, lipid droplet size regulation and fat mass expansion. These data suggest that a peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure is sufficient to shape offspring gene expression patterns and health outcomes in a sex- and organ-specific manner, indicating varying developmental vulnerabilities between sexes towards metabolic disease in response to maternal overnutrition. 	2014	04	16	Biochim Biophys Acta	Dahlhoff	M
24418552	10.1016/j.virol.2013.11.022	HTLV-1 infects human mesenchymal stromal cell in vitro and modifies their phenotypic characteristics.	The typical characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be affected by inflammatory microenvironment; however, the exact contribution of HTLV-1 to MSC dysfunction remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that MSC cell surface molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are upregulated by contact with HTLV-1, and HLA-DR was most highly expressed in MSCs co-cultured with MT2 cells. The expression levels of VCAM-1 and HLA-DR were increased in MSCs cultured in the presence of PBMCs isolated from HTLV-1-infected symptomatic individuals compared with those cultured with cells from asymptomatic infected individuals or healthy subjects. HTLV-1 does not impair the MSC differentiation process into osteocytes and adipocytes. In addition, MSCs were efficiently infected with HTLV-1 in vitro through direct contact with HTLV-1-infected cells; however, cell-free virus particles were not capable of causing infection. In summary, HTLV-1 can alter MSC function, and this mechanism may contribute to the pathogenesis of this viral infection. 	2014	04	07	Virology	Rodrigues	Evandra Strazza
23266771	10.1016/j.cca.2012.12.012	ACTB in cancer.	Beta-actin (ACTB) has traditionally been regarded as an endogenous housekeeping gene and has been widely used as a reference gene/protein in quantifying expression levels in tumors. However, ACTB is closely associated with a variety of cancers and accumulating evidence indicates that ACTB is de-regulated in liver, melanoma, renal, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, breast, prostate, ovarian cancers, leukemia and lymphoma. ACTB is generally found to be up-regulated in the majority of tumor cells and tissues. The abnormal expression and polymerization of ACTB and the resulting changes to the cytoskeleton are revealed to be associated with the invasiveness and metastasis of cancers. The current review explores relevant mechanisms, integrates current understandings, and provides suggestions for future studies of the roles of ACTB in tumors.	2013	08	27	Clin Chim Acta	Guo	Chunmei
23326330	10.1371/journal.pone.0052384	Activated ERM protein plays a critical role in drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25.	We have previously demonstrated that the CCR9/CCL25 signaling pathway plays an important role in drug resistance in human acute T-lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) by inducing activation of ERM protein with polarized distribution in T-ALL cell line MOLT4. However, the mechanism of action of the activated ERM protein in the drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25 remains uncharacterized. Here we investigated the mechanism of CCR9/CCL25-initiated drug resistance in CCR9-high-expressing T-ALL cells. Our results showed that 1) the function of P-gp was increased after treatment with CCL25; 2) P-gp colocalized and co-immunoprecipitated with p-ERM and F-actin in CCL25 treated cells; and 3) ERM-shRNA conferred drug sensitivity coincident with release of ERM interactions with P-gp and F-actin after treatment with CCL25. These data suggest it is pivotal that P-gp associate with the F-actin cytoskeleton through p-ERM in CCR9/CCL25 induced multidrug resistance of T-ALL cells. Strategies aimed at inhibiting P-gp-F-actin cytoskeleton association may be helpful in increasing the efficiency of therapies in T-ALL.	2013	07	05	PLoS One	Zhang	Li
23849470	10.1186/1756-8722-6-52	Protein biomarkers distinguish between high- and low-risk pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a tissue specific manner.	The current study evaluated the differential expression detected in the proteomic profiles of low risk- and high risk- ALL pediatric patients to characterize candidate biomarkers related to diagnosis, prognosis and patient targeted therapy. Bone marrow and peripheral blood plasma and cell lysates samples were obtained from pediatric patients with low- (LR) and high-risk (HR) ALL at diagnosis. As controls, non-leukemic pediatric patients were studied. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out by G- banding and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization. Differential proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The differential expression of certain proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The obtained data revealed that CLUS, CERU, APOE, APOA4, APOA1, GELS, S10A9, AMBP, ACTB, CATA and AFAM proteins play a significant role in leukemia prognosis, potentially serving as distinctive biomarkers for leukemia aggressiveness, or as suppressor proteins in HR-ALL cases. In addition, vitronectin and plasminogen probably contributed to leukemogenesis, whilst bicaudal D-related protein 1 could afford a significant biomarker for pediatric ALL therapeutics. 	2014	05	05	J Hematol Oncol	Braoudaki	Maria
22343534	10.1073/pnas.1121343109	Discovery and prioritization of somatic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by whole-exome sequencing.	To gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.	2012	05	04	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Lohr	Jens G
19309015	10.1002/elps.200800508	2-D PAGE-based comparison of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in sensitive and resistant mantle cell lymphoma.	Although gene expression following bortezomib treatment has been previously explored, direct effects of bortezomib-induced proteasome inhibition on protein level has not been analyzed so far. Using 2-D PAGE in five mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, we screened for cellular protein level alterations following treatment with 25 nM bortezomib for up to 4 h. Using MS, we identified 38 of the 41 most prominent reliably detected protein spots. Twenty-one were affected in all cell lines, whereas the remaining 20 protein spots were exclusively altered in sensitive cell lines. Western blot analysis was performed for 17 of the 38 identified proteins and 70.6% of the observed protein level alterations in 2-D gels was verified. All cell lines exhibited alterations of the cellular protein levels of heat shock-induced protein species (HSPA9, HSP7C, HSPA5, HSPD1), whereas sensitive cell lines also displayed altered cellular protein levels of energy metabolism (ATP5B, AK5, TPI1, ENO-1, ALDOC, GAPDH), RNA and transcriptional regulation (HNRPL, SFRS12) and cell division (NEBL, ACTB, SMC1A, C20orf23) as well as tumor suppressor genes (ENO-1, FH). These proteins clustered in a tight interaction network centered on the major cellular checkpoints TP53. The results were confirmed in primary mantle cell lymphoma, thus confirming the critical role of these candidate proteins of proteasome inhibition.	2009	08	18	Electrophoresis	Weinkauf	Marc
20031021	10.1016/j.rbmo.2009.09.024	Apoptosis in normal ovaries of women with and without endometriosis.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors predisposing to implants of endometriotic lesions in normal ovarian cortexes of women with and without endometriosis by assessing the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors and follicular density. Ovarian biopsies were performed during laparoscopy in 18 patients with endometrioma and in 10 healthy women. Detection of apoptosis was performed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay. p53 and BCL2 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate BAX , BAK , BCL2 , BCL-XL , survivin and beta-actin ( ACTB ) expression. The p53 protein was positive in a significantly higher number of secondary follicles, whereas the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein was positive in all follicles in unaffected tissue of endometriotic women, compared with the controls. Overexpression of the BCL2 and survivin genes and a decreased BAX and BAK gene expression were observed in the endometriotic group although only the difference in survivin expression was significant (P = 0.016). The BCL2 / BAX ratio showed an increased value in the ovarian cortex in controls compared with endometriosis patients. In conclusion, the reduction of apoptosis in unaffected tissue in women with endometriosis suggests that they may be predisposed to develop endometriosis.	2010	02	25	Reprod Biomed Online	Depalo	Raffaella
17823310	10.1182/blood-2007-04-087775	HGAL, a lymphoma prognostic biomarker, interacts with the cytoskeleton and mediates the effects of IL-6 on cell migration.	HGAL is a newly identified germinal center (GC)-specific gene whose expression by the tumor cells correlates with a favorable prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. The function of HGAL is unknown. Previous studies demonstrated that HGAL is dispensable for GC formation, immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. Herein, we identify a role for HGAL in the regulation of cell motility. We demonstrate that IL-6 induces the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue of the HGAL protein via the Lyn kinase, and promotes its relocalization from the cytoplasm to podosome-like structures. Further, IL-6-induced HGAL phosphorylation increases its interaction with myosin II and is associated with inhibition of cell migration. Knockdown of endogenous HGAL ameliorates IL-6-induced inhibition of cell migration, whereas overexpression of HGAL imparts inhibitory effects of IL-6 on cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that HGAL is involved in negative regulation of lymphocyte migration, thus constraining lymphocytes to the GC. Inhibition of lymphocyte migration might contribute to the less aggressive clinical behavior of HGAL-expressing lymphomas.	2008	02	26	Blood	Lu	Xiaoqing
16105984	10.1182/blood-2005-03-1204	p130Cas mediates the transforming properties of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase.	Translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been described in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) and in stromal tumors. The most frequent translocation, t(2;5), generates the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Along with transformation, NPM-ALK induces morphologic changes in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells, suggesting a direct role of ALK in cell shaping. In this study, we used a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach to search for proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and identified p130Cas (p130 Crk-associated substrate) as a novel interactor of NPM-ALK. In 293 cells and in fibroblasts as well as in human ALK-positive lymphoma cell lines, NPM-ALK was able to bind p130Cas and to induce its phosphorylation. Both of the effects were dependent on ALK kinase activity and on the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), since no binding or phosphorylation was found with the kinase-dead mutant NPM-ALK(K210R) or in the presence of a Grb2 dominant-negative protein. Phosphorylation of p130Cas by NPM-ALK was partially independent from Src (tyrosine kinase pp60c-src) kinase activity, as it was still detectable in Syf-/- cells. Finally, p130Cas-/- (also known as Bcar1-/-) fibroblasts expressing NPM-ALK showed impaired actin filament depolymerization and were no longer transformed compared with wild-type cells, indicating an essential role of p130Cas activation in ALK-mediated transformation.	2006	01	18	Blood	Ambrogio	Chiara
1505215	10.1159/000133336	Sublocalization of an invasion-inducing locus and other genes on human chromosome 7.	By somatic cell fusion studies between noninvasive mouse T-lymphoma cells and invasive human activated normal T-cells we have previously shown that the genetic information responsible for the induction of invasive and metastatic potential in interspecies T-cell hybrids is located on human chromosome 7. Apparently, genes derived from normal activated T-cells are dominantly expressed in the hybrids and control the invasive and, as a consequence, metastatic potential of these T-lymphoma cells. To sublocalize the invasion-inducing locus on chromosome 7 we have generated hybrids that harbor only specific regions of human chromosome 7 with or without a small fragment of human chromosome 21. Analysis of these hybrids revealed that the invasion-inducing locus maps to 7p12----cen. The human DNA complement of the hybrids was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a large panel of chromosome 7-specific DNA probes. Several of these genes could be further sublocalized. These included: ARAF2 to 7p12----cen, D7S21 to 7pter----p12, ACTB to 7p15----p12, EGFR to 7p12, MDH2 to 7cen----q22, and PDGFA to 7pter----p15.	1992	09	22	Cytogenet Cell Genet	Habets	G G
34265801	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001780	Plasticity of Mature B Cells Between Follicular and Classic Hodgkin Lymphomas: A Series of 22 Cases Expanding the Spectrum of Transdifferentiation.	Follicular lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma can be associated in composite and/or sequential lymphomas. Common IGH and BCL2 rearrangements have already been identified between both contingents of these entities, but mutation profiles have not yet been investigated. The main objective of this study was to analyze the transdifferentiation process that may occur between Hodgkin and follicular contingents in sequential and composite lymphomas to better characterize these entities. From 2004 to 2020, a retrospective multicentric study was performed, including 9 composite and 13 sequential lymphomas. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, polymerase chain reaction of IGH and IGK rearrangements, next-generation sequencing of IGK rearrangement, and targeted next-generation sequencing (TNGS) on a panel of genes frequently mutated in lymphomas were performed on each contingent of composite and sequential lymphomas. For TNGS, each contingent was isolated by laser capture microdissection. Clinical presentation and evolution were more aggressive in sequential than composite lymphomas. By fluorescent in situ hybridization, common rearrangements of BCL6 and BCL2 were identified between both contingents. Similarly, a common clonal relationship was established by evaluating IGH and IGK rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing. By TNGS, the same pathogenic variants were identified in both contingents in the following genes: CREBBP, KMT2D, BCL2, EP300, SF3B1, SOCS1, ARID1A, and BCOR. Specific pathogenic variants for each contingent were also identified: XPO1 for Hodgkin lymphoma contingent and FOXO1, TNFRSF14 for follicular lymphoma contingent. This study reinforces the hypothesis of a transdifferentiation process between Hodgkin and follicular contingent of sequential/composite lymphomas.	2022	02	14	Am J Surg Pathol	Trecourt	Alexis
34560683	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001813	A Comprehensive Clinicopathologic and Molecular Study of 19 Primary Effusion Lymphomas in HIV-infected Patients.	Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is associated with human herpesvirus 8 and frequently with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We report here a single-center series of 19 human immunodeficiency virus-associated PELs, including 14 EBV+ and 5 EBV- PELs. The objectives were to describe the clinicopathologic features of PELs, with a focus on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, to search for genetic alterations by targeted deep sequencing analysis, and to compare the features between EBV+ and EBV- cases. All the patients were male, and the median age at diagnosis was 47 years old (interquartile range: 40 to 56 y). Reflecting the terminal B-cell differentiation, immunophenotypic profiles showed low expression levels of B-cell markers, including CD19 (0/19), CD20 (1/19), CD79a (0/19), PAX5 (1/19), BOB1 (3/19), and OCT2 (4/19), contrasting with a common expression of CD38 (10/19), CD138 (7/19), and IRF4/MUM1 (18/19). We observed a frequent aberrant expression of T-cell markers, especially CD3 (10/19), and less frequently CD2 (2/19), CD4 (3/19), CD5 (1/19), and CD8 (0/19). Only 2 cases were PD-L1 positive on tumor cells and none PD-1 positive. With respect to immune cells, 3 samples tested positive for PD-L1 and 5 for PD-1. Our 36-gene lymphopanel revealed 7 distinct variants in 5/10 PELs, with either a single or 2 mutations per sample: B2M (n=2), CD58 (n=1), EP300 (n=1), TNFAIP3 (n=1), ARID1A (n=1), and TP53 (n=1). Finally, we did not observe any major clinical, pathologic, or immunohistochemical differences between EBV+ and EBV- PELs and the outcome was similar (2-y overall survival probability of 61.9% [95% confidence interval, 31.2-82.1] vs. 60.0% [95% confidence interval, 12.6-88.2], respectively, P=0.62).	2022	03	07	Am J Surg Pathol	Calvani	Julien
34649275	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005316	Worse outcome and distinct mutational pattern in follicular lymphoma with anti-HBc positivity.	Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), mainly for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). We studied a cohort of 121 patients with FL for HBV infection status, clinical features, and gene mutational profile. Anti-HBc was detectable in 16 patients (13.2%), although all had undetectable HBV DNA. Anti-HBcore+ (anti-HBc+) cases presented with older age at diagnosis than anti-HBc- cases (68.1 vs 57.2 years; P = .007) and higher β2-microglobulin (56.3% vs 28.9%; P = .04). All patients included in the study fulfilled criteria for treatment and received therapy with rituximab or rituximab-containing chemotherapy. There were no episodes of HBV reactivation or HBV hepatitis during treatment and/or maintenance. Remarkably, anti-HBc+ patients had significantly lower 10-year progression-free survival (PFS; 12.9% vs 58.3%; P &lt; .0001) and overall survival (OS; 22.0% vs 86.2%; P &lt; .0001), that remained at multivariate analysis. Gene mutational profiling of all cases showed that anti-HBc+ cases had higher incidence of ARID1A mutations and absence of EP300 mutations, 2 key epigenetic regulators in FL. Overall, our study shows that FL patients with resolved HBV infection have a worse outcome independently of other well-known clinical risk factors and a distinct gene mutational profile.	2022	03	10	Blood Adv	Fernández-Rodríguez	Concepción
34791836	10.1002/cam4.4422	Identification of a genetic signature enriching for response to ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma in the DAWN phase 2 trial.	The single-arm DAWN trial (NCT01779791) of ibrutinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 20.9% and a median response duration of 19.4 months. This biomarker analysis of the DAWN dataset sought to determine genetic classifiers for prediction of response to ibrutinib treatment. Whole exome sequencing was performed on baseline tumor samples. Potential germline variants were excluded; a custom set of 1216 cancer-related genes was examined. Responder- versus nonresponder-associated variants were identified using Fisher's exact test. Classifiers with increasing numbers of genes were created using a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selected genes, adding the most nonresponders to the existing ""predicted nonresponders"" set and were evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. Exome data were generated from 88 patient samples and 13,554 somatic mutation variants were inferred. Response data were available for 83 patients (17 responders, 66 nonresponders). Each sample showed 100 to &gt;500 mutated genes, with greater variance across nonresponders. The overall variant pattern was consistent with previous FL studies; 75 genes had mutations in &gt;10% of patients, including genes previously reported as associated with FL. Univariate analysis yielded responder-associated genes FANCA, HISTH1B, ANXA6, BTG1, and PARP10, highlighting the importance of functions outside of B-cell receptor signaling, including epigenetic processes, DNA damage repair, cell cycle/proliferation, and cell motility/invasiveness. While nonresponder-associated genes included well-known TP53 and CARD11, genetic classifiers developed using nonresponder-associated genes included ATP6AP1, EP400, ARID1A, SOCS1, and TBL1XR1, suggesting resistance to ibrutinib may be related to broad biological functions connected to epigenetic modification, telomere maintenance, and cancer-associated signaling pathways (mTOR, JAK/STAT, NF-κB). The results from univariate and genetic classifier analyses provide insights into genes associated with response or resistance to ibrutinib in FL and identify a classifier developed using nonresponder-associated genes, which warrants further investigation.

35038193	10.1111/his.14617	Incidence, clinicopathological features and genetics of in-situ follicular neoplasia: a comprehensive screening study in a Japanese cohort.	In-situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN) is a histologically recognizable neoplastic proliferation of follicular lymphoma (FL)-like B cells confined to the germinal centres. While some ISFNs are associated with overt FL, others are incidentally identified as isolated or pure forms in individuals without evidence of overt FL. The prevalence of incidentally found isolated ISFN is approximately 3% in Europe; however, no screening study has been conducted in Asia. To investigate the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of ISFNs in the Japanese population, we conducted histopathological screening of the lymph nodes (LNs) resected for solid tumours or inflammatory conditions. We screened for ISFN in 5700 LNs from 340 individuals using immunohistochemistry for BCL2 and identified seven ISFNs, with an incidence of 2.1%. The median age of the individuals with ISFN was 67 years, none of whom developed overt FL, with a median follow-up of 59 months. Next-generation sequencing was performed in five ISFNs, and 10 variants in seven FL-associated genes were identified. The identified variants included HIST1H1E (n = 2), ARID1A (n = 2), KMT2D (n = 1), CARD11 (n = 1), BCL7A (n = 1), CREBBP (n = 1) and TNFRSF14 (n = 1). The incidence of isolated ISFN in the Japanese population is not significantly different from that in Europe, presumably reflecting the recent increase in FL in Japan. These incidentally found ISFNs have a low potential to transform into overt FL. Although mutations of FL-associated genes are already present in ISFNs, further molecular studies are needed to identify driver genes leading to the transformation of ISFN to overt FL.	2022	03	30	Histopathology	Oishi	Naoki
35054466	10.3390/life12010073	The Pathologic and Genetic Characteristics of Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma.	Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a neoplasm of NK cells or cytotoxic T cells presenting in extranodal sites, most often in the nasal cavity. The typical immunophenotypes are cCD3+, sCD3-, CD4-, CD5-, CD8-, CD16-, and CD56+ with the expression of cytotoxic molecules. Tumor subsets express NK cell receptors, CD95/CD95L, CD30, MYC, and PDL1. Virtually all the tumor cells harbor the EBV genome, which plays a key role in lymphomagenesis as an epigenetic driver. EBV-encoded oncoproteins modulate the host-cell epigenetic machinery, reprogramming the viral and host epigenomes using host epigenetic modifiers. NGS analysis revealed the mutational landscape of ENKTL, predominantly involving the JAK-STAT pathway, epigenetic modifications, the RNA helicase family, the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, and tumor suppressors, which indicate an important role of these pathways and this group of genes in the lymphomagenesis of ENKTL. Recently, three molecular subtypes were proposed, the tumor-suppressor/immune-modulator (TSIM), MGA-BRDT (MB), and HDAC9-EP300-ARID1A (HEA) subtypes, and they are well-correlated with the cell of origin, EBV pattern, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes. A future investigation into the function and interaction of discovered genes would be very helpful for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of ENKTL and establishing better treatment strategies.	2022	01	28	Life (Basel)	Kim	Hyunsung
35172382	10.1002/JLB.5A0721-361R	Genomic heterogeneity contributed to different prognosis between adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic.	The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults is inferior to that in children. Hence, ALL remains challenging to cure in the adult population. Aberrant genetic alterations have been observed in ALL, although the patterns of differential gene alterations in adult and pediatric ALL have not been comprehensively determined on a genome-wide scale. We investigated the biologic differences in genomic profiles between adults (n = 64) and children (n = 54) with ALL and relationship between genomic heterogeneity and prognosis. The 2 populations showed similar common mutation types but an increased prevalence of genetic alterations in adult ALL. The median numbers of gene mutations were 17 (range: 1-53) and 4.5 (range: 1-19) per sample in adult and pediatric ALL, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). An increased number of gene mutations and age were significantly correlated (R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.5853, p &lt; 0.001). We identified 122 and 53 driver genes in adult and pediatric ALL samples, respectively. IKZF1, IDH1, and TTN mutations were significantly enriched in adult patients with ALL. KRAS, ARID1A, and CREBBP mutations were significantly enriched in pediatric patients with ALL (p &lt; 0.05). The incidence of relapse was 40.0% and 9.6% in adult and pediatric patients with ALL, respectively (p = 0.003). The overall survival and relapse-free survival of adult patients with ALL were poorer than those of pediatric patients with ALL (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). This genomic landscape enhances the understanding of the biologic differences in ALL between the 2 populations and provides insight for developing therapeutic approaches.	2022	08	26	J Leukoc Biol	Chen	Yanxin
35317330	10.14740/wjon1436	Non-GCB Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma With an Atypical Disease Course: A Case Report and Clinical Exome Analysis.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid tumor among other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (30-40% of all cases). This type of lymphoma is characterized by significant differences in treatment response and the heterogeneity of clinical traits. Approximately 60% of patients are cured using standard chemotherapy (CT), while in 10-15% of cases, the tumor is characterized by an extremely aggressive course and resistance to even the most high-dose programs with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is characterized by poor prognosis. Here, we describe a clinical case of diffuse ABC-DLBCL with an atypical disease course. Complete remission was achieved after four courses of CT, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). However, early relapse occurred 2 months after the completion of treatment. According to the results of cytogenetic studies, significant chromosome breakdowns were observed. Exome sequencing allowed for the detection of several novel mutations that affect components of the NOTCH2 and NF-κB signaling pathways, a number of epigenetic regulators (<i>KMT2D</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>MEF2B</i>), as well as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (<i>CD58</i> and <i>CD70</i>). Whether these mutations were the result of therapy or were originally present in the lymphoid tumor remains unclear. Nevertheless, the introduction of genomic technologies into clinical practice is important for making a diagnosis and developing a DLBCL treatment regimen with the use of targeted drugs.	2022	03	24	World J Oncol	Tsygankova	Svetlana
35454811	10.3390/cancers14081904	Deciphering Genetic Alterations of Hairy Cell Leukemia and Hairy Cell Leukemia-like Disorders in 98 Patients.	Hairy cell leukemia (cHCL) patients have, in most cases, a specific clinical and biological presentation with splenomegaly, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, monocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia, identification of hairy cells that express CD103, CD123, CD25, CD11c and identification of the V600E mutation in the B-Raf proto-oncogene (<i>BRAF</i>) in 90% of cases. Monocytopenia is absent in vHCL and SDRPL patients and the abnormal cells do not express CD25 or CD123 and do not present the <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation. Ten percent of cHCL patients are BRAF<sup>WT</sup> and the distinction between cHCL and HCL-like disorders including the variant form of HCL (vHCL) and splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) can be challenging. We performed deep sequencing in a large cohort of 84 cHCL and 16 HCL-like disorders to improve insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases. <i>BRAF</i> mutations were detected in 76/82 patients of cHCL (93%) and additional mutations were identified in Krüppel-like Factor 2 (<i>KLF2</i>) in 19 patients (23%) or <i>CDKN1B</i> in 6 patients (7.5%). Some <i>KLF2</i> genetic alterations were localized on the cytidine deaminase (AID) consensus motif, suggesting AID-induced mutations. When analyzing sequential samples, a clonal evolution was identified in half of the cHCL patients (6/12 pts). Among the 16 patients with HCL-like disorders, we observed an enrichment of <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations in vHCL/SDRPL (3/5 pts) and genes involved in the epigenetic regulation (<i>KDM6A, EZH2, CREBBP, ARID1A</i>) (3/5 pts). Furthermore, <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations were associated with a bad prognosis and a shorter time to next treatment (TTNT) and progression-free survival (PFS), independently of the HCL classification.	2022	07	16	Cancers (Basel)	Maitre	Elsa
35727053	10.1002/cncr.34348	Differential prognostic effect of systemic inflammation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy: A post hoc analysis of the phase 3 OAK trial.	A proinflammatory diathesis, as measured by the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), heralds an adverse disease course for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This post hoc analysis used data from the phase 3 OAK trial (NCT02008227), which randomized previously treated patients with NSCLC to atezolizumab or docetaxel. The main objective was assessing the differential impact of the pretreatment NLR on overall survival according to the treatment modality. In addition, patients' genomic characteristics were assessed according to their inflammatory status with a circulating free DNA (cfDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. In all, 600 and 575 patients with NLR data were included in the atezolizumab and docetaxel cohorts, respectively, with a median NLR of 4 (interquartile range, 2.6-6.7) for the pooled population. An NLR ≥4 was associated with a positive smoking status (88.6% vs. 78.1%; p &lt; .01), male sex (66.4% vs. 57.6%; p = .01), a worse performance status (71.3% vs. 55.2%; p &lt; .01), a higher number of metastatic sites (63.2% vs. 51.6%; p = .01), squamous histology (32.1% vs. 21.4%; p &lt; .01), and tissue KRAS mutations (30% vs. 18.7%; p = .02) but not with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression or the tissue epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status. A pretreatment NLR ≥4 was more strongly associated with mortality after atezolizumab (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.01) versus docetaxel (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.60; multivariable [MVA] interaction p = .08). The HR for an increased risk of death for PD-L1-negative/NLR ≥4 patients (compared with PD-L1-positive/NLR &lt;4 patients) was significantly higher in the atezolizumab cohort (MVA interaction p = .01). The exclusion of EGFR/ALK-positive patients further increased the prognostic ability of the baseline NLR in favor of atezolizumab (MVA interaction p = .02). Pretreatment cfDNA data from NGS showed that patients with a high blood tumor mutation burden (cutoff, 16 mut/Mb) had a higher median NLR (4.6 vs. 3.7; p = .01). After adjustments for multiple comparisons, none of the selected variants of interest (EGFR, KRAS, TP53, KEAP1, STK11, SMARCA4, ARID1A, and targeted DNA damage response and repair genes) were significantly associated with the NLR. A low baseline NLR identified patients with NSCLC who derived a greater survival benefit from atezolizumab in comparison with those identified in the docetaxel cohort. The NLR could complement PD-L1 expression in tailoring treatment in this setting.	2022	08	08	Cancer	Cortellini	Alessio
35794096	10.1038/s41467-022-31355-8	Clinical relevance of molecular characteristics in Burkitt lymphoma differs according to age.	While survival has improved for Burkitt lymphoma patients, potential differences in outcome between pediatric and adult patients remain unclear. In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25 ± 4% versus 6 ± 2%, p-value 0.0002). This identifies a promising molecular marker for relapse incidence in pediatric BL which will be used in future clinical trials.	2022	07	08	Nat Commun	Burkhardt	Birgit
35879731	10.1186/s40364-022-00401-4	Dynamic change of soluble interleukin-2 receptor distinguished molecular heterogeneity and microenvironment alterations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma with variable clinical outcomes and prediction of prognosis remains important for long-term remission. We performed serial serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) measurement pretreatment and before each cycle of the treatment in 599 patients with de novo DLBCL. Genomic and transcriptomic features were analyzed by 223 DNA- and 227 RNA-sequencing, respectively. Applying the cut-off value to sIL-2R pretreatment and cycle 2 (C2) level, patients were classified into FINE subtype (pretreatment low level) with good prognosis, RES subtype (pretreatment high level and C2 low level) with intermediate prognosis, and RET subtype (pretreatment high level and C2 high level) with poor prognosis, independent of International Prognostic Index. In ""others"" genetic subtype, dynamic change of sIL-2R showed prognostic significance and genetic features. Compared with FINE subtype, RES subtype had increased ARID1A and MYD88 mutations, and RET subtype had increased KMT2D, LYN and SOCS1 mutations. RES and RET subtypes showed significant enrichment in oncogenic pathways, such as ERK, NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and immune-associated pathways. As for tumor microenvironment, RES subtype exhibited increased recruiting activity of CD8 + T, T helper 1, and natural killer cells, and RET subtype with increased recruiting activity of CD4 + T and regulatory T cells in silico. There was a positive correlation between transcripts of IL-2R and immune checkpoint expressions including PD-1 and CTLA-4. Our findings identified that dynamic change of sIL-2R, with this simple and easy detection method in peripheral blood, had long-term prognostic effect and specific relation to microenvironment alterations in DLBCL.	2022	07	29	Biomark Res	Huo	Yu-Jia
36001451	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001956	Targeted Mutational Profiling Reveals Clonal Relationships in Metachronous Occurrence of Classic Hodgkin and Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphomas.	Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) patients may infrequently present with a prior or recurrent disease with discordant histology resembling non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These include primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or mediastinal gray-zone lymphoma (MGZL). Such patients are often refractory to standard therapy and their diagnosis is hampered by significant morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap and insufficient molecular data. Among 509 CHL patients seen at an academic medical center, 6 patients had a prior or subsequent diagnosis different from CHL. Paired tissue samples were evaluated by targeted mutational analysis using a 164-gene panel. Our findings show multiple shared variants indicative of a clonal relationship between the CHL and the PMBL, DLBCL, or MGZL diagnoses. Most frequent mutated genes included TNFAIP3 (4 of 6, 66.7%), STAT6 (3 or 6, 50%), ARID1A (3 of 6, 50%), and XPO1 (3 of 5, 60%). Three patients showed the same oncogenic variant within the XPO1 gene (E571K), and mutations in TNFAIP3 and B2M were observed in 2 of the 5 patients with shared variants. In addition, differences in the mutation profile between the lymphoma pairs were also observed, which could represent clonal evolution. Mutational profiling could be of benefit in patients with recurrent/refractory disease with discordant histology, where the clonal relationship could be helpful to inform and guide therapeutic decisions. These findings provide further evidence of a true biological continuum surrounding CHL, PMBL, DLBCL, and MGZL and shed light on underlying genetic events and their clinical impact.	2022	08	24	Am J Surg Pathol	Singh	Kunwar
33431788	10.1038/s41392-020-00437-8	CREBBP/EP300 mutations promoted tumor progression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through altering tumor-associated macrophage polarization via FBXW7-NOTCH-CCL2/CSF1 axis.	Epigenetic alterations play an important role in tumor progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the biological relevance of epigenetic gene mutations on tumor microenvironment remains to be determined. The core set of genes relating to histone methylation (KMT2D, KMT2C, EZH2), histone acetylation (CREBBP, EP300), DNA methylation (TET2), and chromatin remodeling (ARID1A) were detected in the training cohort of 316 patients by whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) and in the validation cohort of 303 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL by targeted sequencing. Their correlation with peripheral blood immune cells and clinical outcomes were assessed. Underlying mechanisms on tumor microenvironment were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Among all 619 DLBCL patients, somatic mutations in KMT2D (19.5%) were most frequently observed, followed by mutations in ARID1A (8.7%), CREBBP (8.4%), KMT2C (8.2%), TET2 (7.8%), EP300 (6.8%), and EZH2 (2.9%). Among them, CREBBP/EP300 mutations were significantly associated with decreased peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios, as well as inferior progression-free and overall survival. In B-lymphoma cells, the mutation or knockdown of CREBBP or EP300 inhibited H3K27 acetylation, downregulated FBXW7 expression, activated the NOTCH pathway, and downstream CCL2/CSF1 expression, resulting in tumor-associated macrophage polarization to M2 phenotype and tumor cell proliferation. In B-lymphoma murine models, xenografted tumors bearing CREBBP/EP300 mutation presented lower H3K27 acetylation, higher M2 macrophage recruitment, and more rapid tumor growth than those with CREBBP/EP300 wild-type control via FBXW7-NOTCH-CCL2/CSF1 axis. Our work thus contributed to the understanding of aberrant histone acetylation regulation on tumor microenvironment as an alternative mechanism of tumor progression in DLBCL.	2022	03	04	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Huang	Yao-Hui
33829512	10.1111/his.14378	Bcl-2-negative IGH-BCL2 translocation-negative follicular lymphoma of the thyroid differs genetically and epigenetically from Bcl-2-positive IGH-BCL2 translocation-positive follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL), comprising a minor subset of primary thyroid lymphomas, is divided into two groups based on Bcl-2 expression and IGH-BCL2 translocation. The clinicopathological features exhibited by Bcl-2-negative IGH-BCL2 translocation-negative FL of the thyroid (Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL) are different from those of conventional FL; however, its lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we collected samples from seven patients with Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL to investigate their epigenetic and genetic aberrations. The immunohistochemical profiles of epigenetic modifiers and the methylation status of histones were examined, including EZH2, MLL2/KMT2D, CBP/CREBBP, EP300, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL and Bcl-2-positive IGH-BCL2 translocation-positive FL of the thyroid (Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFL). Most Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs retained the positivity of epigenetic modifiers and lower expression of H3K27me3, although Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs exhibited aberrant immunohistochemical patterns of EZH2 and CBP/CREBBP and overexpression of H3K27me3. Samples from seven cases were further analysed using targeted sequencing, focusing on the exons of 409 key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs do not have pathogenic mutations of epigenetic modifiers, such as EZH2, MLL2/KMT2D, MLL3/KMT2C, EP300 and ARID1A, which have been reported in FLs in the literature, whereas Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs are probably pathogenic/pathogenic missense mutations or frameshift mutations of these genes. Additionally, novel mutations in TET2 and EP400 were detected in Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs. Different genetic and epigenetic abnormalities might be involved in the oncogenesis of Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs from Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs and other FLs.	2022	01	28	Histopathology	Hamamoto	Yuichiro
34039950	10.1038/s41408-021-00493-5	Genomic insights into the pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by whole-genome and targeted amplicon sequencing.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS) constitute a distinct clinicopathological entity in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. However, its genomic features remain sparsely characterized. Here, we combine whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted amplicon sequencing (tNGS), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) from 47 EBV + DLBCL (NOS) cases to delineate the genomic landscape of this rare disease. Integrated WGS and tNGS analysis clearly distinguished this tumor type from EBV-negative DLBCL due to frequent mutations in ARID1A (45%), KMT2A/KMT2D (32/30%), ANKRD11 (32%), or NOTCH2 (32%). WGS uncovered structural aberrations including 6q deletions (5/8 patients), which were subsequently validated by FISH (14/32 cases). Expanding on previous reports, we identified recurrent alterations in CCR6 (15%), DAPK1 (15%), TNFRSF21 (13%), CCR7 (11%), and YY1 (6%). Lastly, functional annotation of the mutational landscape by sequential gene set enrichment and network propagation predicted an effect on the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway (CSNK2A2, CARD10), IL6/JAK/STAT (SOCS1/3, STAT3), and WNT signaling (FRAT1, SFRP5) alongside aberrations in immunological processes, such as interferon response. This first comprehensive description of EBV + DLBCL (NOS) tumors substantiates the evidence of its pathobiological independence and helps stratify the molecular taxonomy of aggressive lymphomas in the effort for future therapeutic strategies.	2022	01	10	Blood Cancer J	Gebauer	Niklas
34070951	10.3390/diagnostics11060999	Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Cholangiocarcinoma.	The analysis of cfDNA has been applied as a liquid biopsy in several malignancies. However, its value in the diagnosis and prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have not been well defined. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic values of cfDNA level and tumor-specific mutation in circulating DNA (ctDNA) in CCA. The plasma cfDNA levels from 62 CCA patients, 33 benign biliary disease (BBD) patients and 30 normal controls were quantified by fluorescent assay. Targeted probe-based sequencing of 60 genes was applied for mutation profiling in 10 ctDNA samples and their corresponding treatment-naïve tissues. cfDNA levels in CCA were significantly higher than those in BBD and normal controls. We found that cfDNA levels at 0.2175 and 0.3388 ng/µL significantly discriminated CCA from healthy controls and BBD with 88.7 and 82.3% sensitivity and 96.7 and 57.6% specificity, respectively. cfDNA levels showed superior diagnostic efficacy in detecting CCA compared to CEA and CA19-9. <i>ARID1A</i> (30%), <i>PBRM1</i> (30%), <i>MTOR</i> (30%), and <i>FGFR3</i> (30%) mutations were the most common. Using nine frequently mutated genes in the ctDNA samples, the diagnostic accuracy of cfDNA sequencing was 90.8%, with 96.7% average sensitivity and 72.4% specificity. This study supports the use of cfDNA as a diagnosis and prognostic biomarker for CCA.	2021	06	27	Diagnostics (Basel)	Wintachai	Preawwalee
34348985	10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207441	Clinicopathological characteristics and genetic variations of uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours.	To investigate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours (UTROSCTs) and the value of molecular diversity in the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Five patients with UTROSCT were enrolled, and their clinical data, pathological morphologies, immunophenotypes and molecular features were analysed. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation for <i>NCOA1</i>, <i>NCOA2</i>, <i>NCOA3</i>, <i>JAZF1</i> and <i>PHF1</i> and next-generation sequencing for 27 homologous recombination/repair (HRR) pathway genes were performed on five and three UTROSCT specimens, respectively. All five patients were treated for abnormal uterine bleeding and grossly presented with intrauterine polyps. Under a microscope, tumour cells grew diffusely and presented a cordlike arrangement and glandular duct-like structures, with nuclei ranging from round to oval, vesicular chromatin and visible nucleoli in some cases. The mitotic count was less than 3/10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry showed sex cord, epithelial cell and smooth muscle cell biomarkers and diffuse, strong staining for B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2). <i>NCOA1</i> and <i>NCOA3</i> rearrangements were identified in 80% (4/5) of the cases. <i>JAZF1</i> and <i>PHF1</i> rearrangements were not detected in any of five patients. HRR pathway gene mutations were detected in all three patients, including <i>FANCE</i>, <i>ATR</i> and <i>ARID1A</i> mutations in one case each. UTROSCT is a rare mesenchymal tumour, and biopsy specimens are easily misdiagnosed. UTROSCT diagnosis requires the combined use of biomarkers and molecular detection. BCL-2 has potential diagnostic value as a marker. UTROSCT can have mutations related to the HRR pathway, suggesting that this tumour type may be sensitive to platinum/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.	2021	08	05	J Clin Pathol	Ye	Shan
31423576	10.1111/bjh.16159	M7-FLIPI is not prognostic in follicular lymphoma patients with first-line rituximab chemo-free therapy.	The clinical course of follicular lymphoma (FL) is highly variable. Recently the m7-FL international prognostic index (FLIPI) integrating performance status, FLIPI score and the mutational status of seven genes, was shown to stratify patients into ""low-risk"" and ""high-risk"" with respect to 5-year failure-free survival after first-line immunochemotherapy. Our aim was to evaluate the model after rituximab without chemotherapy. The Nordic Lymphoma Group performed two randomized clinical trials on indolent lymphoma patients receiving single rituximab and rituximab with interferon-α2a. In total, 95 FL patients had sufficient fresh-frozen diagnostic material for sequencing. A targeted panel for the genes EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP and CARD11 was utilized for m7-FLIPI score calculation. With a median follow-up of 10·6 years, 76% of patients were alive. No difference in time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as the interval between start of trial therapy and initiation of new therapy or death, nor overall survival (OS) was found between the m7-FLIPI risk groups (log-rank P = 0·94 and 0·99, respectively). EZH2 mutations were associated with longer TTF (log-rank P = 0·04) and in EP300 mutations were associated with shorter TTF (log-rank P = 0·01). We conclude that the prognostic value of the m7-FLIPI clinicogenetic model seems dependent on therapeutic regimen.	2020	08	05	Br J Haematol	Lockmer	Sandra
32083995	10.1200/JCO.19.02314	Genomic Landscape of Waldenström Macroglobulinemia and Its Impact on Treatment Strategies.	Next-generation sequencing has revealed recurring somatic mutations in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), including <i>MYD88</i> (95%-97%), <i>CXCR4</i> (30%-40%), <i>ARID1A</i> (17%), and <i>CD79B</i> (8%-15%). Deletions involving chromosome 6q are common in patients with mutated <i>MYD88</i> and include genes that modulate NFKB, BCL2, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), and apoptosis. Patients with wild-type <i>MYD88</i> WM show an increased risk of transformation and death and exhibit many mutations found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The discovery of <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> mutations in WM has facilitated rational drug development, including the development of BTK and CXCR4 inhibitors. Responses to many agents commonly used to treat WM, including the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, are affected by <i>MYD88</i> and/or <i>CXCR4</i> mutation status. The mutation status of both <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> can be used for a precision-guided treatment approach to WM.	2020	12	23	J Clin Oncol	Treon	Steven P

A 4-year-old female child developed cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis 6 months following a diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imaging revealed no evidence of systemic disease. Seven months later, the first systemic lesion was discovered on laryngoscopy. Restaging Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography at that time revealed new 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positive lesions in the left apical pleural margin, right lower peri-esophageal region, left ventricular myocardium, pancreas, upper pole of the left kidney, and inguinal and gluteal regions consistent with progressive systemic disease. Genomic testing revealed a low tumor mutational burden as well as mutations in KRAS G12A, ARID1A Q524, CDKN2A/B loss, and an alteration in NOTCH1.	2021	01	25	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Jansen	Chandler
32978169	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2147	EZH2-Targeted Therapies in Cancer: Hype or a Reality.	Next-generation genomic sequencing has identified multiple novel molecular alterations in cancer. Since the identification of DNA methylation and histone modification, it has become evident that genes encoding epigenetic modifiers that locally and globally regulate gene expression play a crucial role in normal development and cancer progression. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the enzymatic catalytic subunit of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that can alter gene expression by trimethylating lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27). EZH2 is involved in global transcriptional repression, mainly targeting tumor-suppressor genes. EZH2 is commonly overexpressed in cancer and shows activating mutations in subtypes of lymphoma. Extensive studies have uncovered an important role for EZH2 in cancer progression and have suggested that it may be a useful therapeutic target. In addition, tumors harboring mutations in other epigenetic genes such as <i>ARID1A, KDM6</i>, and <i>BAP1</i> are highly sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, thus increasing its potential as a therapeutic target. Recent studies also suggest that inhibition of EZH2 enhances the response to tumor immunotherapy. Many small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target EZH2 or the PRC2 complex, with some of these inhibitors now in early clinical trials reporting clinical responses with acceptable tolerability. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in targeting EZH2, its successes, and potential limitations, and we discuss the future directions of this therapeutic subclass.	2021	03	29	Cancer Res	Eich	Marie-Lisa
33252851	10.1002/ctm2.221	Influence of oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations on extranodal invasion in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive subtype of lymphoma, and multiple extranodal involvement (ENI) indicates adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations on ENI in DLBCL. The clinical features of 1960 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL were analyzed, and DNA and RNA sequencing was performed on 670 and 349 patients, respectively. Oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations were compared according to ENI and evaluated in zebrafish patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Multiple ENI was significantly associated with poor performance status, advanced stage, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, low response rate, and inferior prognosis. Lymphoma invasion of the bones, spleen, bone marrow, liver, and central nervous system were independent unfavorable prognostic factors. MYD88 was frequently mutated in patients with multiple ENI, co-occurred with mutations in CD79B, PIM1, TBL1XR1, BTG1, MPEG1, and PRDM1, and correlated with invasion of the bones, kidney/adrenal glands, breasts, testes, skin, and uterus/ovaries. For tumor microenvironment alterations, patients with multiple ENI showed higher regulatory T-cell (Treg)-recruiting activity, but lower extracellular matrix-encoding gene expression, than those without ENI and with single ENI. Elevated Treg-recruiting activity was related to mutations in B2M, SGK1, FOXO1, HIST1H1E, and ARID1A, and correlated with invasion of the bone marrow and thyroid. Additionally, mutations in MYD88, PIM1, TBL1XR1, SGK1, FOXO1, HIST1H1E, and ARID1A were associated with decreased major histocompatibility complex class I expression. Zebrafish models further revealed relationships between MYD88 mutations and invasion of the kidneys and gonads, as well as B2M mutations and invasion of the bone marrow. Increased CXCR4 expression is linked to bone marrow invasion in an organotropic way. Our findings thus contribute to an improved understanding of the biological behavior of multiple ENI and provide a clinical rationale for targeting ENI in DLBCL.	2020	12	07	Clin Transl Med	Shen	Rong
33376237	10.1038/s41392-020-00331-3	Combination of anti-PD-1 antibody with P-GEMOX as a potentially effective immunochemotherapy for advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma.	Advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTL) has demonstrated poor prognosis with currently available therapies. Here, we report the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody with the P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) regimen in advanced NKTL. Nine patients underwent six 21-day cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody (day 1), pegaspargase 2000 U/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1 and 8) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), followed by anti-PD-1 antibody maintenance every 3 weeks. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and genetic alterations were determined in paraffin-embedded pretreatment tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Responses were assessed using <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG-PET) and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients exhibited significant responses, comprising of seven complete remissions and one partial remission (overall response rate: 88.9%). After a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 6/9 patients (66.7%) remained in complete remission. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (33.3%), neutropenia (33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (33.3%); all of which were manageable and resolved. Immunochemotherapy produced a high response rate in patients with positive PD-L1 expression (5/6, 83.3%). NGS analysis suggested that STAT3/JAK3/PD-L1 alterations and ARID1A mutation were associated with immunochemotherapy efficacy. Mutation in DDX3X and alteration in epigenetic modifiers of KMT2D, TET2, and BCORL1 might indicate a poor response to immunochemotherapy. In conclusion, the anti-PD-1 antibody plus P-GEMOX regimen demonstrated promising efficacy in advanced NKTL. PD-L1 expression combined with specific genetic alterations could be used as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses to immunochemotherapy.	2021	10	13	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Cai	Jun
30886885	10.1016/j.gore.2019.02.007	Endometrial cancer arising after complete remission of uterine malignant lymphoma: A case report and mutation analysis.	Uterine malignant lymphoma is rare and its association with secondary cancer has not been fully described. Here, we report a rare case of endometrial cancer arising after 1 year of complete remission of uterine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). An 88-year-old woman was referred to us for abnormal genital bleeding and was diagnosed with uterine DLBCL. She underwent chemotherapy comprising rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone followed by radiation therapy; subsequently, she achieved complete remission. One year later, she noticed genital bleeding recurrence, and endometrial biopsy revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma. Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Her pathological diagnosis was endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, grade 1 (pT1aN0). Adenocarcinoma was observed over foamy macrophages aggregates, indicating remission of DLBCL. Targeted sequencing of both DLBCL and endometrial cancer revealed 24 gene mutations including the truncation-type mutations of <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>PTEN</i> occurring only in endometrial cancer. These multiple somatic gene mutations accumulating within 1 year imply endometrial carcinogenesis induced by DNA damages caused by treatment for DLBCL. Although the epidemiological risk of secondary malignancies after uterine lymphoma remains unclear, the present case serves as a warning for secondary cancer and highlights the importance of early detection and treatment.	2020	10	01	Gynecol Oncol Rep	Kuno	Ikumi
31123138	10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205727	Intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma: clinicopathological and integrated molecular analysis of two cases provides a clue to disease pathogenesis.	To elucidate the clinicopathological and molecular features of intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma (IVNKTCL). Two cases of IVNKTCL were retrieved from a single-centre cohort composed of 25 intravascular lymphomas. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry were performed. We identified somatic mutations in the following epigenetic regulators: four histone genes (<i>HIST1H2AN</i>, <i>HIST1H2BE</i>, <i>HIST1H2BN</i> and <i>H3F3A),</i> histone deacetylase (<i>HDAC5</i>), two helicases (<i>WRN</i> and <i>DDX3X</i>), two methylation-related enzymes (<i>TET2</i> and <i>DNMT1</i>) and the SNI/SWF pathway (<i>ARID1A</i>). Copy number analysis identified driver gene alterations comprising the loss of <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>HACE1</i> and <i>SMAD4</i>, and the gain of <i>SOX2</i> and histone clusters. RNA sequencing analysis did not indicate the presence of any fusion gene. Both cases were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and showed strong expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This study raises the possibility that, at least for some patients, IVNKTCL may be considered an epigenetic disease with EBV infection-associated aetiopathogenesis.	2019	09	03	J Clin Pathol	Fujikura	Kohei
31300419	10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029546	Sporadic and endemic Burkitt lymphoma have frequent <i>FOXO1</i> mutations but distinct hotspots in the AKT recognition motif.	FOXO1 has an oncogenic role in adult germinal center-derived lymphomas, in which mutations, predominately within the AKT recognition motif, cause nuclear retention of FOXO1, resulting in increased cell proliferation. To determine the prevalence and distribution of <i>FOXO1</i> mutations in pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL), we sequenced a large number of sporadic and endemic BL patient samples. We report a high frequency of <i>FOXO1</i> mutations in both sporadic and endemic BL at diagnosis, occurring in 23/78 (29%) and 48/89 (54%) samples, respectively, as well as 8/16 (50%) cases at relapse. Mutations of T24 were the most common in sporadic BL but were rare in endemic cases, in which mutations of residue S22, also within the AKT recognition motif, were the most frequent. <i>FOXO1</i> mutations were almost always present in the major tumor cell clone but were not associated with outcome. Analysis of other recurrent mutations reported in BL revealed that <i>FOXO1</i> mutations were associated with mutations of <i>DDX3X</i> and <i>ARID1A,</i> but not <i>MYC</i>, <i>TCF3</i>/<i>ID3,</i> or members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. We further show common nuclear retention of the FOXO1 protein, irrespective of mutation status, suggesting alternative unknown mechanisms for maintaining FOXO1 transcriptional activity in BL. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of <i>FOXO1</i> in an endemic cell line produced a significant decrease in cell proliferation, supporting an oncogenic role for <i>FOXO1</i> in endemic BL. Thus, <i>FOXO1</i> is frequently mutated in both sporadic and endemic BL and may offer a potential therapeutic target for pediatric BL patients worldwide.	2020	07	07	Blood Adv	Zhou	Peixun
31747604	10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.083	Targeting Excessive EZH1 and EZH2 Activities for Abnormal Histone Methylation and Transcription Network in Malignant Lymphomas.	Although global H3K27me3 reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, no effective therapeutic strategy for H3K27me3-high malignancies harboring EZH2<sup>WT/WT</sup> has yet been established. We explore epigenome and transcriptome in EZH2<sup>WT/WT</sup> and EZH2<sup>WT/Mu</sup> aggressive lymphomas and show that mutual interference and compensatory function of co-expressed EZH1 and EZH2 rearrange their own genome-wide distribution, thereby establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Direct comparison of leading compounds introduces potency and a mechanism of action of the EZH1/2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat). The synthetic lethality is observed in all lymphoma models and primary adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells. Opposing actions of EZH1/2-polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes are required for facultative heterochromatin formation. Inactivation of chromatin-associated genes (ARID1A, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCB1/SNF5, KDM6A/UTX, BAP1, KMT2D/MLL2) and oncovirus infection (HTLV-1, EBV) trigger EZH1/2 perturbation and H3K27me3 deposition. Our study provides the mechanism-based rationale for chemical dual targeting of EZH1/2 in cancer epigenome.	2020	09	21	Cell Rep	Yamagishi	Makoto
29307627	10.1016/j.humpath.2017.12.025	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma composed predominantly of rhabdoid/epithelioid cells: a frequently misdiagnosed highly aggressive variant.	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is one of the most common sarcoma types in adults with a predilection for the retroperitoneum. We have recently encountered 6 cases of DDL composed predominantly of rounded, rhabdoid or epithelioid cells mimicking rhabdoid melanoma, epithelioid rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients were 5 males and one female aged 64 to 81 years (median, 68). Tumors originated in the retroperitoneum (n=5; 3 in the psoas muscle) and deep soft tissue of the thigh (n=1). All 3 patients with follow-up died of metastatic disease within 4 to 8 months. Preoperative biopsy diagnoses never suggested dedifferentiated liposarcoma as a possibility; instead carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma were on top of suggestions. Five resected tumors were composed predominantly (70%-100%) of anaplastic rounded to oval rhabdoid cells with prominent central nucleoli and paranuclear rhabdoid inclusions. Bi- and multinucleation was a constant feature. The background stroma showed variable myxoid changes and minor mixed inflammatory cells. Two cases showed homologous dedifferentiation and another had sclerosing spindle cell nodule but a well-differentiated lipomatous component was not seen in any. One biopsied case showed solely monotonous small round blue cells with scattered rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of MDM2 (6/6), CDK4 (5/6), pancytokeratin AE/1AE3 (4/6) and diffusely desmin and myogenin (2/6). All cases showed high-level co-amplification of MDM2/CDK4 by in situ hybridization. The SWI/SNF complex components (SMARCB1, SMARCA2, SMARCA4, ARID1A and PBRM1) were intact in all cases. This highly aggressive liposarcoma variant needs to be distinguished from a variety of neoplasms including undifferentiated carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and others.	2019	04	09	Hum Pathol	Agaimy	Abbas
29486633	10.1177/1533034618754475	Loss of ARID1A Expression Correlates With Tumor Differentiation and Tumor Progression Stage in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.	Mutations in the AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene, which encodes a subunit of the Switch/Sucrose nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, can result in loss of protein expression and are associated with different cancers. Here, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the significance of AT-rich interactive domain 1A loss in 73 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases with paired paracancerous normal pancreatic tissues. The relationship between levels of the AT-rich interactive domain 1A protein product, BAF250a, and clinicopathological parameters in the 73 pancreatic cancer specimens was also analyzed. We found that the expression of AT-rich interactive domain 1A in normal pancreatic tissue was higher than that in tumor tissue. Loss of AT-rich interactive domain 1A expression in pancreatic tumors was associated with tumor differentiation ( P = .002) and tumor stage ( P = .048). Meanwhile, BAF250a protein levels were not related to lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, sex, or age and were not associated with survival. Transfection of the pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1 and PANC-1 with small-interfering RNA specific for AT-rich interactive domain 1A resulted in elevated messenger RNA and protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), CyclinD1, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS). The AT-rich interactive domain 1A expression level in the cells was increased following microRNA-31 (miR-31) inhibitor transfection. Our data provide additional evidence that AT-rich interactive domain 1A might function as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic carcinogenesis.	2019	04	01	Technol Cancer Res Treat	Zhang	Li
29669287	10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.078	ZRANB1 Is an EZH2 Deubiquitinase and a Potential Therapeutic Target in Breast Cancer.	Although EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors have shown antitumor effects in EZH2-mutated lymphoma and ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, many cancers do not respond because EZH2 can promote cancer independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. Here we identify ZRANB1 as the EZH2 deubiquitinase. ZRANB1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes EZH2. Depletion of ZRANB1 in breast cancer cells results in EZH2 destabilization and growth inhibition. Systemic delivery of ZRANB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to marked antitumor and antimetastatic effects in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Intriguingly, a small-molecule inhibitor of ZRANB1 destabilizes EZH2 and inhibits the viability of TNBC cells. In patients with breast cancer, ZRANB1 levels correlate with EZH2 levels and poor survival. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential for targeting the EZH2 deubiquitinase ZRANB1.	2019	09	17	Cell Rep	Zhang	Peijing
29989027	10.18632/oncotarget.25601	New generation sequencing of targeted genes in the classical and the variant form of hairy cell leukemia highlights mutations in epigenetic regulation genes.	Classical hairy cell leukemia (HCL-c) is a rare lymphoid neoplasm. <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation, detected in more than 80% of the cases, is described as a driver mutation, but additional genetic abnormalities appear to be necessary for the disease progression. For cases of HCL-c harboring a wild-type <i>BRAF</i> gene, the differential diagnosis of the variant form of HCL (HCL-v) or splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) is complex. We selected a panel of 21 relevant genes based on a literature review of whole exome sequencing studies (<i>BRAF</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, <i>DUSP2</i>, <i>MAPK15</i>, <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>EZH2</i>, <i>KDM6A</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>CDKN1B</i>, <i>XPO1</i>, <i>KLF2</i>, <i>CXCR4</i>, <i>NOTH1</i>, <i>NOTCH2</i>, <i>MYD88</i>, <i>ANXA1</i>, <i>U2AF1</i>, <i>BCOR</i>, and <i>ABCA8</i>). We analyzed 20 HCL-c and 4 HCL-v patients. The analysis of diagnostic samples mutations in <i>BRAF</i> (<i>n</i> = 18), <i>KLF2</i> (<i>n</i> = 4), <i>MAP2K1</i> (<i>n</i> = 3), <i>KDM6A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CDKN1B</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>ARID1A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CREBBP</i> (<i>n</i> = 2) <i>NOTCH1</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) and <i>ARID1B</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> was found in 90% (18/20) of HCL-c patients. In HCL-c patients with <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> , other mutations were found in 33% (6/18) of cases. All 4 HCL-v patients had mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes: <i>KDM6A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CREBBP</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) or <i>ARID1A</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). The analysis of sequential samples (at diagnosis and relapse) from 5 patients (2 HCL-c and 3 HCL-v), showed the presence of 2 new subclonal mutations (<i>BCOR<sup>E1430X</sup></i> and <i>XPO1<sup>E571K</sup></i> ) in one patient and variations of the mutated allele frequency in 2 other cases. In the HCL-v disease, we described new mutations targeting <i>KDM6A</i> that encode a lysine demethylase protein. This opens new perspectives for personalized medicine for this group of patients.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Maitre	Elsa
30134235	10.1159/000492835	Frequent Mutations in Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma.	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL-NT or NKTCL), with its aggressive nature and poor prognosis, has been widely studied to discover more effective treatment options. Various somatic gene alterations have been identified by traditional Sanger sequencing. However, recently, novel gene mutations in NKTCL have been revealed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, suggesting the potential for novel targeted therapies. This review discusses recurrent aberrations in NKTCL detected by NGS, which can be categorized into three main groups, specifically, tumor suppressors (TP53, DDX3X, and MGA), the JAK/STAT cascade, and epigenetic modifiers (KMT2D, BCOR, ARID1A, and EP300). Some epigenetic dysregulation and DDX3X mutation, which have been rarely identified by traditional sequencing technology, were recently uncovered with high frequencies by NGS. In this review, we summarize the mutational frequencies of various genes in NKTCL. In general, based on our analysis, BCOR is the most frequently mutated gene (16.9%), followed by TP53 (14.7%), and DDX3X (13.6%). The characterization of such genes provides new insight into the pathogenesis of this disease and indicates new biomarkers or therapeutic targets.	2018	09	18	Cell Physiol Biochem	Zhang	Yanjie

27872090	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1303	Mutational Landscape of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Current standard of care for patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is mainly effective, with high remission rates after treatment. However, the genetic perturbations that give rise to this disease remain largely undefined, limiting the ability to address resistant tumors or develop less toxic targeted therapies. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to interrogate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of 240 pediatric ALL cases with their matched remission samples. Commonly mutated genes fell into several categories, including RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors involved in lineage commitment, and the p53/cell-cycle pathway. Unique recurrent mutational hotspots were observed in epigenetic regulators CREBBP (R1446C/H), WHSC1 (E1099K), and the tyrosine kinase FLT3 (K663R, N676K). The mutant WHSC1 was established as a gain-of-function oncogene, while the epigenetic regulator ARID1A and transcription factor CTCF were functionally identified as potential tumor suppressors. Analysis of 28 diagnosis/relapse trio patients plus 10 relapse cases revealed four evolutionary paths and uncovered the ordering of acquisition of mutations in these patients. This study provides a detailed mutational portrait of pediatric ALL and gives insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.

28401006		Genomic and proteomic characterization of ARID1A chromatin remodeller in ampullary tumors.	<i>AT rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A)</i> is one of the most commonly mutated genes in a broad variety of tumors. The mechanisms that involve <i>ARID1A</i> in ampullary cancer progression remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the frequency of <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>KRAS</i> mutations in ampullary adenomas and adenocarcinomas and in duodenal adenocarcinomas from two cohorts of patients from Singapore and Romania, correlated with clinical and pathological tumor features, and assessed the functional role of <i>ARID1A</i>. In the ampullary adenocarcinomas, the frequency of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>ARID1A</i> mutations was 34.7% and 8.2% respectively, with a loss or reduction of ARID1A protein in 17.2% of the cases. <i>ARID1A</i> mutational status was significantly correlated with ARID1A protein expression level (P=0.023). There was a significant difference in frequency of <i>ARID1A</i> mutation between Romania and Singapore (2.7% versus 25%, P=0.04), suggestive of different etiologies. One somatic mutation was detected in the ampullary adenoma group. <i>In vitro</i> studies indicated the tumor suppressive role of <i>ARID1A</i>. Our results warrant further investigation of this chromatin remodeller as a potential early biomarker of the disease, as well as identification of therapeutic targets in <i>ARID1A</i> mutated ampullary cancers.	2020	09	30	Am J Cancer Res	Nastase	Anca
29025291	10.1556/650.2017.30868	[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and its individualized therapy options].	Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia is a form of lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma that preferentially localizes to the bone marrow and causes a special syndrome characterized by monoclonal IgM hypersecretion. Recent results point to the fact that this disease has at least three different pathobiological forms with different clinical presentation. While mutations of MYD88 occur in 95-97% of the cases, there are CXCR4 mutations in 30-40%, ARID1A mutations in 17% and CD79B mutations in approximately 10% of afflicted individuals. CXCR pathway signaling is able to transcriptionally silence tumor suppressors induced by MYD88 activation. Patients with mutated MYD88 and CXCR4 present with higher tumor burden, slower developing and less deep response upon therapy with more frequent resistance. In this review, based on the most recent data, a treatment selection advice is provided for the therapy of symptomatic patients.

29222279	10.1182/asheducation-2017.1.358	Follicular lymphoma: are we ready for a risk-adapted approach?	Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western hemisphere. The natural history of FL appears to have been favorably impacted by the introduction of rituximab after randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy induction has improved the overall survival. Yet, the disease is biologically and clinically heterogeneous with wide variations in outcomes for individual patients. The ability to accurately risk-stratify patients and then tailor therapy to the individual is an area of ongoing research. Historically, tumor grade, tumor burden, and the FL international prognostic index (version 1 and version 2) have been used to distinguish low-risk from high-risk patients. Biologic factors such as mutations in key genes can identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes to first-line therapy (mutational status of 7 genes [EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOX01, CREBBP, and CARD11] with Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index). More recently, the quality of the response to initial therapy, as measured by either PET imaging or by remission duration, has been show to identify individuals at high risk. However, several unmet needs remain, including a better ability to identify high-risk patients at diagnosis, the development of predictive biomarkers for targeted agents, and strategies to reduce the risk of transformation.	2018	07	18	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Kahl	Brad S

27102345	10.1038/modpathol.2016.79	Comprehensive genomic profiling of orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas identifies frequent alterations in MYD88 and chromatin modifiers: new routes to targeted therapies.	Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the orbit and ocular adnexa is the most common primary orbital malignancy. Treatments for low- (extra-nodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas) and high-grade (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) are associated with local and vision-threatening toxicities. High-grade lymphomas relapse frequently and exhibit poor survival rates. Despite advances in genomic profiling and precision medicine, orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas remain poorly characterized molecularly. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas obtained from a single-center using a panel targeting near-term, clinically relevant genes. Potentially actionable mutations and copy number alterations were prioritized based on gain- and loss-of-function analyses, and catalogued, approved, and investigational therapies. Of 36 informative samples, including marginal zone lymphomas (n=20), follicular lymphomas (n=9), and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=7), 53% harbored a prioritized alteration (median=1, range 0-5/sample). MYD88 was the most frequently altered gene in our cohort, with potentially clinically relevant hotspot gain-of-function mutations identified in 71% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 25% of marginal zone lymphomas. Prioritized alterations in epigenetic modulators were common and included gain-of-function EZH2 and loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (14% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 22% of follicular lymphomas contained alterations in each of these two genes). Single prioritized alterations were also identified in the histone methyltransferases KMT2B (follicular lymphoma) and KMT3B (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Loss-of-function mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma), CDKN2A (diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphoma), PTEN (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), ATM (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and NF1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and gain-of-function mutations in the oncogenes HRAS (follicular lymphoma) and NRAS (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were also observed. Together, our study demonstrates that NGS can be used to profile routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas for identification of somatic-driving alterations and nomination of potential therapeutic strategies.	2018	01	12	Mod Pathol	Cani	Andi K
27590521	10.18632/oncotarget.11773	Deep targeted sequencing in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia unveils distinct mutational patterns between genetic subtypes and novel relapse-associated genes.	To characterize the mutational patterns of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) we performed deep next generation sequencing of 872 cancer genes in 172 diagnostic and 24 relapse samples from 172 pediatric ALL patients. We found an overall greater mutational burden and more driver mutations in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients compared to B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. In addition, the majority of the mutations in T-ALL had occurred in the original leukemic clone, while most of the mutations in BCP-ALL were subclonal. BCP-ALL patients carrying any of the recurrent translocations ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL or TCF3-PBX1 harbored few mutations in driver genes compared to other BCP-ALL patients. Specifically in BCP-ALL, we identified ATRX as a novel putative driver gene and uncovered an association between somatic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway at ALL diagnosis and increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, we identified EP300, ARID1A and SH2B3 as relapse-associated genes. The genes highlighted in our study were frequently involved in epigenetic regulation, associated with germline susceptibility to ALL, and present in minor subclones at diagnosis that became dominant at relapse. We observed a high degree of clonal heterogeneity and evolution between diagnosis and relapse in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL, which could have implications for the treatment efficiency.	2018	05	22	Oncotarget	Lindqvist	C Mårten
27729836	10.5808/GI.2016.14.3.78	Mutational Analysis of Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma Using Targeted Sequencing with a Comprehensive Cancer Panel.	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL), is a malignant disorder of cytotoxic lymphocytes of NK or T cells. It is an aggressive neoplasm with a very poor prognosis. Although extranodal NKTCL reportedly has a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus, the molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has been unexplored. The recent technological advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made DNA sequencing cost- and time-effective, with more reliable results. Using the Ion Proton Comprehensive Cancer Panel, we sequenced 409 cancer-related genes to identify somatic mutations in five NKTCL tissue samples. The sequencing analysis detected 25 mutations in 21 genes. Among them, <i>KMT2D</i>, a histone modification-related gene, was the most frequently mutated gene (four of the five cases). This result was consistent with recent NGS studies that have suggested <i>KMT2D</i> as a novel driver gene in NKTCL. Mutations were also found in <i>ARID1A</i>, a chromatin remodeling gene, and <i>TP53</i>, which also recurred in recent NGS studies. We also found mutations in 18 novel candidate genes, with molecular functions that were potentially implicated in cancer development. We suggest that these genes may result in multiple oncogenic events and may be used as potential bio-markers of NKTCL in the future.	2020	09	30	Genomics Inform	Choi	Seungkyu
25444907	10.1016/j.canlet.2014.11.024	Gene mutations in primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts derived from non-small cell lung cancer.	Molecular annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are useful for the preclinical investigation of anticancer drugs and individualized anticancer therapy. We established 23 PDXs from 88 surgical specimens of lung cancer patients and determined gene mutations in these PDXs and their paired primary tumors by ultradeep exome sequencing on 202 cancer-related genes. The numbers of primary tumors with deleterious mutations in TP53, KRAS, PI3KCA, ALK, STK11, and EGFR were 43.5%, 21.7%, 17.4%, 17.4%, 13.0%, and 8.7%, respectively. Other genes with deleterious mutations in ≥3 (13.0%) primary tumors were MLL3, SETD2, ATM, ARID1A, CRIPAK, HGF, BAI3, EP300, KDR, PDGRRA and RUNX1. Of 315 mutations detected in the primary tumors, 293 (93%) were also detected in their corresponding PDXs, indicating that PDXs have the capacity to recapitulate the mutations in primary tumors. Nevertheless, a substantial number of mutations had higher allele frequencies in the PDXs than in the primary tumors, or were not detectable in the primary tumor, suggesting the possibility of tumor cell enrichment in PDXs or heterogeneity in the primary tumors. The molecularly annotated PDXs generated from this study could be useful for future translational studies. 	2015	04	21	Cancer Lett	Hao	Chuncheng
25779943	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2759	Genetics and Prognostication in Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Revelations from Deep Sequencing.	Mounting evidence supports the clinical significance of gene mutations and immunogenetic features in common mature B-cell malignancies. We undertook a detailed characterization of the genetic background of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), using targeted resequencing and explored potential clinical implications in a multinational cohort of 175 patients with SMZL. We identified recurrent mutations in TP53 (16%), KLF2 (12%), NOTCH2 (10%), TNFAIP3 (7%), MLL2 (11%), MYD88 (7%), and ARID1A (6%), all genes known to be targeted by somatic mutation in SMZL. KLF2 mutations were early, clonal events, enriched in patients with del(7q) and IGHV1-2*04 B-cell receptor immunoglobulins, and were associated with a short median time to first treatment (0.12 vs. 1.11 years; P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, mutations in NOTCH2 [HR, 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-4.4; P = 0.044] and 100% germline IGHV gene identity (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.05-4.55; P = 0.036) were independent markers of short time to first treatment, whereas TP53 mutations were an independent marker of short overall survival (HR, 2.36; 95 % CI, 1.08-5.2; P = 0.03). We identify key associations between gene mutations and clinical outcome, demonstrating for the first time that NOTCH2 and TP53 gene mutations are independent markers of reduced treatment-free and overall survival, respectively.	2016	08	02	Clin Cancer Res	Parry	Marina
25918285	10.1200/JCO.2014.59.2444	Genomic Characterization of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in African Americans by Targeted Massively Parallel Sequencing.	Technologic advances have enabled the comprehensive analysis of genetic perturbations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, African Americans have often been underrepresented in these studies. This ethnic group has higher lung cancer incidence and mortality rates, and some studies have suggested a lower incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Herein, we report the most in-depth molecular profile of NSCLC in African Americans to date. A custom panel was designed to cover the coding regions of 81 NSCLC-related genes and 40 ancestry-informative markers. Clinical samples were sequenced on a massively parallel sequencing instrument, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The study cohort included 99 patients (61% males, 94% smokers) comprising 31 squamous and 68 nonsquamous cell carcinomas. We detected 227 nonsilent variants in the coding sequence, including 24 samples with nonoverlapping, classic driver alterations. The frequency of driver mutations was not significantly different from that of whites, and no association was found between genetic ancestry and the presence of somatic mutations. Copy number alteration analysis disclosed distinguishable amplifications in the 3q chromosome arm in squamous cell carcinomas and pointed toward a handful of targetable alterations. We also found frequent SMARCA4 mutations and protein loss, mostly in driver-negative tumors. Our data suggest that African American ancestry may not be significantly different from European/white background for the presence of somatic driver mutations in NSCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using a comprehensive genotyping approach could identify numerous targetable alterations, with potential impact on therapeutic decisions.	2015	08	21	J Clin Oncol	Araujo	Luiz H
26192917	10.1038/ng.3358	Exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of DDX3X in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.	Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a malignant proliferation of CD56(+) and cytoCD3(+) lymphocytes with aggressive clinical course, which is prevalent in Asian and South American populations. The molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has largely remained elusive. We identified somatic gene mutations in 25 people with NKTCL by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed them in an extended validation group of 80 people by targeted sequencing. Recurrent mutations were most frequently located in the RNA helicase gene DDX3X (21/105 subjects, 20.0%), tumor suppressors (TP53 and MGA), JAK-STAT-pathway molecules (STAT3 and STAT5B) and epigenetic modifiers (MLL2, ARID1A, EP300 and ASXL3). As compared to wild-type protein, DDX3X mutants exhibited decreased RNA-unwinding activity, loss of suppressive effects on cell-cycle progression in NK cells and transcriptional activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Clinically, patients with DDX3X mutations presented a poor prognosis. Our work thus contributes to the understanding of the disease mechanism of NKTCL. 	2016	01	13	Nat Genet	Jiang	Lu
26256760	10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00169-2	Integration of gene mutations in risk prognostication for patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy for follicular lymphoma: a retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical trial and validation in a population-based registry.	Follicular lymphoma is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease, but the prognostic value of somatic mutations has not been systematically assessed. We aimed to improve risk stratification of patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy by integrating gene mutations into a prognostic model. We did DNA deep sequencing to retrospectively analyse the mutation status of 74 genes in 151 follicular lymphoma biopsy specimens that were obtained from patients within 1 year before beginning immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). These patients were recruited between May 4, 2000, and Oct 20, 2010, as part of a phase 3 trial (GLSG2000). Eligible patients had symptomatic, advanced stage follicular lymphoma and were previously untreated. The primary endpoints were failure-free survival (defined as less than a partial remission at the end of induction, relapse, progression, or death) and overall survival calculated from date of treatment initiation. Median follow-up was 7·7 years (IQR 5·5-9·3). Mutations and clinical factors were incorporated into a risk model for failure-free survival using multivariable L1-penalised Cox regression. We validated the risk model in an independent population-based cohort of 107 patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma considered ineligible for curative irradiation. Pretreatment biopsies were taken between Feb 24, 2004, and Nov 24, 2009, within 1 year before beginning first-line immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP). Median follow-up was 6·7 years (IQR 5·7-7·6). We established a clinicogenetic risk model (termed m7-FLIPI) that included the mutation status of seven genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP, and CARD11), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. In the training cohort, m7-FLIPI defined a high-risk group (28%, 43/151) with 5-year failure-free survival of 38·29% (95% CI 25·31-57·95) versus 77·21% (95% CI 69·21-86·14) for the low-risk group (hazard ratio [HR] 4·14, 95% CI 2·47-6·93; p&lt;0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 2·02), and outperformed a prognostic model of only gene mutations (HR 3·76, 95% CI 2·10-6·74; p&lt;0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 1·57). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival were 64% and 78%, respectively, with a C-index of 0·80 (95% CI 0·71-0·89). In the validation cohort, m7-FLIPI again defined a high-risk group (22%, 24/107) with 5-year failure-free survival of 25·00% (95% CI 12·50-49·99) versus 68·24% (58·84-79·15) in the low-risk group (HR 3·58, 95% CI 2·00-6·42; p&lt;0.0001). The positive predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival was 72% and 68% for negative predictive value, with a C-index of 0·79 (95% CI 0·69-0·89). In the validation cohort, risk stratification by m7-FLIPI outperformed FLIPI alone (HR 2·18, 95% CI 1·21-3·92), and FLIPI combined with ECOG performance status (HR 2·03, 95% CI 1·12-3·67). Integration of the mutational status of seven genes with clinical risk factors improves prognostication for patients with follicular lymphoma receiving first-line immunochemotherapy and is a promising approach to identify the subset at highest risk of treatment failure.

26415585	10.1038/ncomms9470	Genomic analyses reveal recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifiers and the JAK-STAT pathway in Sézary syndrome.	Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukaemia of mature T cells with poor prognosis and limited options for targeted therapies. The comprehensive genetic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of SS are unknown. Here we integrate whole-genome sequencing (n=6), whole-exome sequencing (n=66) and array comparative genomic hybridization-based copy-number analysis (n=80) of primary SS samples. We identify previously unknown recurrent loss-of-function aberrations targeting members of the chromatin remodelling/histone modification and trithorax families, including ARID1A in which functional loss from nonsense and frameshift mutations and/or targeted deletions is observed in 40.3% of SS genomes. We also identify recurrent gain-of-function mutations targeting PLCG1 (9%) and JAK1, JAK3, STAT3 and STAT5B (JAK/STAT total ∼11%). Functional studies reveal sensitivity of JAK1-mutated primary SS cells to JAK inhibitor treatment. These results highlight the complex genomic landscape of SS and a role for inhibition of JAK/STAT pathways for the treatment of SS.	2016	05	24	Nat Commun	Kiel	Mark J
26446488	10.1038/ncomms9325	LRF maintains genome integrity by regulating the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair.	Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) is a POZ/BTB and Krüppel (POK) transcriptional repressor characterized by context-dependent key roles in cell fate decision and tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate an unexpected transcription-independent function for LRF in the classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. We find that LRF loss in cell lines and mouse tissues results in defective cNHEJ, genomic instability and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Mechanistically, we show that LRF binds and stabilizes DNA-PKcs on DSBs, in turn favouring DNA-PK activity. Importantly, LRF loss restores ionizing radiation sensitivity to p53 null cells, making LRF an attractive biomarker to direct p53-null LRF-deficient tumours towards therapeutic treatments based on genotoxic agents or PARP inhibitors following a synthetic lethal strategy. 	2016	05	06	Nat Commun	Liu	Xue-Song
26468873	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005158	Distinct Viral and Mutational Spectrum of Endemic Burkitt Lymphoma.	Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is primarily found in children in equatorial regions and represents the first historical example of a virus-associated human malignancy. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and MYC translocations are hallmarks of the disease, it is unclear whether other factors may contribute to its development. We performed RNA-Seq on 20 eBL cases from Uganda and showed that the mutational and viral landscape of eBL is more complex than previously reported. First, we found the presence of other herpesviridae family members in 8 cases (40%), in particular human herpesvirus 5 and human herpesvirus 8 and confirmed their presence by immunohistochemistry in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. Second, we identified a distinct latency program in EBV involving lytic genes in association with TCF3 activity. Third, by comparing the eBL mutational landscape with published data on sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL), we detected lower frequencies of mutations in MYC, ID3, TCF3 and TP53, and a higher frequency of mutation in ARID1A in eBL samples. Recurrent mutations in two genes not previously associated with eBL were identified in 20% of tumors: RHOA and cyclin F (CCNF). We also observed that polyviral samples showed lower numbers of somatic mutations in common altered genes in comparison to sBL specimens, suggesting dual mechanisms of transformation, mutation versus virus driven in sBL and eBL respectively. 	2016	04	04	PLoS Pathog	Abate	Francesco
26473533	10.1038/bcj.2015.89	Mutation of chromatin modifiers; an emerging hallmark of germinal center B-cell lymphomas.	Subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas align with different stages of B-cell development. Germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) each share molecular similarities with normal GCB cells. Recent next-generation sequencing studies have gained insight into the genetic etiology of these malignancies and revealed a high frequency of mutations within genes encoding proteins that modifying chromatin. These include activating and inactivating mutations of genes that perform post-translational modification of histones and organize chromatin structure. Here, we discuss the function of histone acetyltransferases (CREBBP, EP300), histone methyltransferases (KDM2C/D, EZH2) and regulators of higher order chromatin structure (HIST1H1C/D/E, ARID1A and SMARCA4) that have been reported to be mutated in ⩾5% of DLBCL, FL or BL. Mutations of these genes are an emerging hallmark of lymphomas with GCB-cell origins, and likely represent the next generation of therapeutic targets for these malignancies. 	2016	01	25	Blood Cancer J	Lunning	M A
26551670	10.1038/ng.3444	Genomic profiling of Sézary syndrome identifies alterations of key T cell signaling and differentiation genes.	Sézary syndrome is a rare leukemic form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterized by generalized redness, scaling, itching and increased numbers of circulating atypical T lymphocytes. It is rarely curable, with poor prognosis. Here we present a multiplatform genomic analysis of 37 patients with Sézary syndrome that implicates dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoint and T cell signaling. Frequent somatic alterations were identified in TP53, CARD11, CCR4, PLCG1, CDKN2A, ARID1A, RPS6KA1 and ZEB1. Activating CCR4 and CARD11 mutations were detected in nearly one-third of patients. ZEB1, encoding a transcription repressor essential for T cell differentiation, was deleted in over one-half of patients. IL32 and IL2RG were overexpressed in nearly all cases. Our results demonstrate profound disruption of key signaling pathways in Sézary syndrome and suggest potential targets for new therapies. 	2016	06	21	Nat Genet	Wang	Linghua
24366360	10.1182/blood-2013-09-525808	The genomic landscape of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is characterized by highly recurring MYD88 and WHIM-like CXCR4 mutations, and small somatic deletions associated with B-cell lymphomagenesis.	The genetic basis for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) remains to be clarified. Although 6q losses are commonly present, recurring gene losses in this region remain to be defined. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 30 WM patients, which included germline/tumor sequencing for 10 patients. Validated somatic mutations occurring in &gt;10% of patients included MYD88, CXCR4, and ARID1A that were present in 90%, 27%, and 17% of patients, respectively, and included the activating mutation L265P in MYD88 and warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infection, and myelokathexis-syndrome-like mutations in CXCR4 that previously have only been described in the germline. WGS also delineated copy number alterations (CNAs) and structural variants in the 10 paired patients. The CXCR4 and CNA findings were validated in independent expansion cohorts of 147 and 30 WM patients, respectively. Validated gene losses due to CNAs involved PRDM2 (93%), BTG1 (87%), HIVEP2 (77%), MKLN1 (77%), PLEKHG1 (70%), LYN (60%), ARID1B (50%), and FOXP1 (37%). Losses in PLEKHG1, HIVEP2, ARID1B, and BCLAF1 constituted the most common deletions within chromosome 6. Although no recurrent translocations were observed, in 2 patients deletions in 6q corresponded with translocation events. These studies evidence highly recurring somatic events, and provide a genomic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of WM. 	2014	06	16	Blood	Hunter	Zachary R
24435047	10.1182/blood-2013-05-500264	Mutations in linker histone genes HIST1H1 B, C, D, and E; OCT2 (POU2F2); IRF8; and ARID1A underlying the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the western world. FL carries characteristic recurrent structural genomic aberrations. However, information regarding the coding genome in FL is still evolving. Here, we describe the results of massively parallel exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array genomic profiling of 11 highly purified FL cases, and 1 transformed FL case and the validation of selected mutations in 102 FL cases. We report the identification of 15 novel recurrently mutated genes in FL. These include frequent mutations in the linker histone genes HIST1H1 B-E (27%) and mutations in OCT2 (also known as POU2F2; 8%), IRF8 (6%), and ARID1A (11%). A subset of the mutations in HIST1H1 B-E affected binding to DNMT3B, and mutations in HIST1H1 B-E and in EZH2 or ARID1A were largely mutually exclusive, implicating HIST1H1 B-E in epigenetic deregulation in FL. Mutations in OCT2 (POU2F2) affected its transcriptional and functional properties as measured through luciferase assays, the biological analysis of stably transduced cell lines, and global expression profiling. Finally, multiple novel mutated genes located within regions of acquired uniparental disomy in FL are identified. In aggregate, these data substantially broaden our understanding of the genomic pathogenesis of FL. 	2014	05	09	Blood	Li	Hongxiu
23292937	10.1073/pnas.1205299110	Genetic heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of lymphoma in adults. The disease exhibits a striking heterogeneity in gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes, but its genetic causes remain to be fully defined. Through whole genome and exome sequencing, we characterized the genetic diversity of DLBCL. In all, we sequenced 73 DLBCL primary tumors (34 with matched normal DNA). Separately, we sequenced the exomes of 21 DLBCL cell lines. We identified 322 DLBCL cancer genes that were recurrently mutated in primary DLBCLs. We identified recurrent mutations implicating a number of known and not previously identified genes and pathways in DLBCL including those related to chromatin modification (ARID1A and MEF2B), NF-κB (CARD11 and TNFAIP3), PI3 kinase (PIK3CD, PIK3R1, and MTOR), B-cell lineage (IRF8, POU2F2, and GNA13), and WNT signaling (WIF1). We also experimentally validated a mutation in PIK3CD, a gene not previously implicated in lymphomas. The patterns of mutation demonstrated a classic long tail distribution with substantial variation of mutated genes from patient to patient and also between published studies. Thus, our study reveals the tremendous genetic heterogeneity that underlies lymphomas and highlights the need for personalized medicine approaches to treating these patients.	2013	03	21	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Zhang	Jenny
22585168	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0208	Molecular ontogeny of donor-derived follicular lymphomas occurring after hematopoietic cell transplantation.	The relative timing of genetic alterations that contribute to follicular lymphoma remains unknown. We analyzed a donor-recipient pair who both developed grade 2/3A follicular lymphoma 7 years after allogeneic transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions. Both patients harbored identical BCL2/IGH rearrangements also present in 1 in 2,000 cells in the donor lymphocyte infusion, and the same V(D)J rearrangement, which underwent somatic hypermutation both before and after clonal divergence. Exome sequencing of both follicular lymphomas identified 15 shared mutations, of which 14 (including alterations in EP300 and KLHL6) were recovered from the donor lymphocyte infusion by ultra-deep sequencing (average read coverage, 361,723), indicating acquisition at least 7 years before clinical presentation. Six additional mutations were present in only one follicular lymphoma and not the donor lymphocyte infusion, including an ARID1A premature stop, indicating later acquisition during clonal divergence. Thus, ultrasensitive sequencing can map clonal evolution within rare subpopulations during human lymphomagenesis in vivo. For the first time, we define the molecular ontogeny of follicular lymphoma during clonal evolution in vivo. By using ultrasensitive mutation detection, we mapped the time-course of somatic alterations after passage of a malignant ancestor by hematopoietic cell transplantation.	2013	01	15	Cancer Discov	Weigert	Oliver
22915242	10.1007/s00428-012-1303-2	ARID1A expression loss in gastric cancer: pathway-dependent roles with and without Epstein-Barr virus infection and microsatellite instability.	The AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene (ARID1A), which encodes one of the subunits in the Switch/Sucrose Nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, carries mutations and is responsible for loss of protein expression in gastric carcinoma, particularly with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and a microsatellite instability-high phenotype. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the significance of ARID1A loss in 857 gastric carcinoma cases, including 67 EBV(+) and 136 MLH1-lost gastric carcinomas (corresponding to a microsatellite instability-high phenotype). Loss of ARID1A expression was significantly more frequent in EBV(+) (23/67; 34 %) and MLH1-lost (40/136; 29 %) gastric carcinomas than in EBV(-)MLH1-preserved (32/657; 5 %) gastric carcinomas (P &lt; 0.01). Loss of ARID1A correlated with larger tumor size, advanced invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in EBV(-)MLH1-preserved gastric carcinoma. A correlation was found only with tumor size and diffuse-type histology in MLH1-lost gastric carcinoma, but no correlation was observed in EBV(+) gastric carcinoma. Loss of ARID1A expression in EBV(+) gastric carcinoma was highly frequent in the early stage of gastric carcinoma, although EBV infection did not cause downregulation of ARID1A: EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas (n = 8) and lymphomas (n = 15) failed to show loss of ARID1A, and EBV infection did not cause loss of ARID1A in gastric carcinoma cell lines. Taken together, loss of ARID1A may be an early change in carcinogenesis and may precede EBV infection in gastric epithelial cells, while loss of ARID1A promotes cancer progression in gastric cancer cells without EBV infection or loss of MLH1 expression. Loss of ARID1A has different and pathway-dependent roles in gastric carcinoma.	2012	12	31	Virchows Arch	Abe	Hiroyuki
22931316	10.1056/NEJMoa1200710	MYD88 L265P somatic mutation in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is an incurable, IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). The underlying mutation in this disorder has not been delineated. We performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells in 30 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the findings in samples from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy donors. Among the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a somatic variant (T→C) in LPL cells was identified at position 38182641 at 3p22.2 in the samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20 samples from patients with unpaired samples. This variant predicted an amino acid change (L265P) in MYD88, a mutation that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-κB signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3 patients with non-IgM-secreting LPL (91% of all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal tissue samples from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88 signaling reduced IκBα and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, as well as NF-κB nuclear staining, in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Somatic variants in ARID1A in 5 of 30 patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had wild-type MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2. MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia that can be useful in differentiating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from B-cell disorders that have some of the same features.

23091298	10.1182/blood-2012-06-437624	Targeted genomic sequencing of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma identifies recurrent alterations in antiapoptotic and chromatin-remodeling genes.	To ascertain the genetic basis of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (pBL), we performed clinical-grade next-generation sequencing of 182 cancer-related genes on 29 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded primary pBL samples. Ninety percent of cases had at least one mutation or genetic alteration, most commonly involving MYC and TP53. EBV(-) cases were more likely than EBV(+) cases to have multiple mutations (P &lt; .0001). Alterations in tumor-related genes not previously described in BL were identified. Truncating mutations in ARID1A, a member of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, were seen in 17% of cases. MCL1 pathway alterations were found in 22% of cases and confirmed in an expanded panel. Other clinically relevant genomic alterations were found in 20% of cases. Our data suggest the roles of MCL1 and ARID1A in BL pathogenesis and demonstrate that comprehensive genomic profiling may identify additional treatment options in refractory disease.	2013	02	15	Blood	Giulino-Roth	Lisa
23143597	10.1038/ng.2468	The genetic landscape of mutations in Burkitt lymphoma.	Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of MYC, but the contribution of other genetic mutations to the disease is largely unknown. Here, we describe the first completely sequenced genome from a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and germline DNA from the same affected individual. We further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that were recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Our data implicate a number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B, SALL3, FTCD and PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas and not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work thus elucidates commonly occurring gene-coding mutations in Burkitt lymphoma and implicates ID3 as a new tumor suppressor gene.	2013	02	13	Nat Genet	Love	Cassandra
21590771	10.1002/path.2911	Loss of BAF250a (ARID1A) is frequent in high-grade endometrial carcinomas.	Mutation of the ARID1A gene and loss of the corresponding protein BAF250a has recently been described as a frequent event in clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary. To determine whether BAF250a loss is common in other malignancies, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BAF250a was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) in more than 3000 cancers, including carcinomas of breast, lung, thyroid, endometrium, kidney, stomach, oral cavity, cervix, pancreas, colon and rectum, as well as endometrial stromal sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, sex cord-stromal tumours and four major types of lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma). We found that BAF250a loss is frequent in endometrial carcinomas but infrequent in other types of malignancies, with loss observed in 29% (29/101) of grade 1 or 2 and 39% (44/113) of grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium, 18% (17/95) of uterine serous carcinomas and 26% (6/23) of uterine clear cell carcinomas. Since endometrial cancers showed BAF250a loss, we stained whole tissue sections for BAF250a expression in nine cases of atypical hyperplasia and 10 cases of atypical endometriosis. Of the nine cases of complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia, all showed BAF250a expression; however, of 10 cases of atypical endometriosis (the putative precursor lesion for ovarian clear cell and endometrioid carcinoma), one case showed loss of staining for BAF250a in the atypical areas, with retention of staining in areas of non-atypical endometriosis. This was the sole case that recurred as an endometrioid carcinoma, indicating that BAF250a loss may be an early event in carcinogenesis. Since BAF250a loss is seen in endometrial carcinomas at a rate similar to that seen in ovarian carcinomas of clear cell and endometrioid type, and is uncommon in other malignancies, we conclude that loss of BAF250a is a particular feature of carcinomas arising from endometrial glandular epithelium.	2011	08	24	J Pathol	Wiegand	Kimberly C
19066270	10.1093/jnci/djn416	The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and glucocorticoid resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Glucocorticoids are used in the curative treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Resistance to glucocorticoids is an important adverse prognostic factor in newly diagnosed ALL patients but its mechanism is unknown. Because SWI/SNF complex-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for glucocorticoid transcriptional activity in vitro, we investigated whether expression of subunits of the SWI/SNF complex was related to glucocorticoid resistance in ALL. Gene expression and in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone and dexamethasone were assessed in a training set of primary ALL cells from 177 children with newly diagnosed ALL and a validation set of cells from an independent cohort of 95 ALL patients. The global test method was used to select pathways whose genes were associated with drug sensitivity. Genes involved in chromatin remodeling were identified by use of the Gene Ontology database. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down mRNA expression of SMARCA4 in glucocorticoid-sensitive Jurkat human ALL cells. Spearman rank correlation, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression were used to investigate associations between gene expression and glucocorticoid sensitivity. All statistical tests were two-sided. Statistically significant associations between decreased expression in ALL cells of genes for core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex-SMARCA4, ARID1A, and SMARCB1-and resistance to prednisolone and dexamethasone were identified in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, expression of SMARCA4 (P &lt; .001 and r = -0.43), ARID1A (P = .016 and r = -0.29), and SMARCB1 (P = .019 and r = -0.29) in ALL cells was statistically significantly associated with dexamethasone sensitivity, and SMARCA4 expression (P = .018 and r = -0.28) was statistically significantly associated with prednisolone sensitivity. Prednisolone resistance was higher in SMARCA4 shRNA-transfected Jurkat cells (drug concentration lethal to 50% of the leukemia cells [LC(50)] = 277 microM) than in control shRNA-transfected cells (LC(50) = 174 microM, difference = 103 microM, 95% confidence interval of the difference = 100 to 106 microM; P &lt; .001, t test). Decreased expression of as many as three subunits of the SWI/SNF complex appears to be associated with glucocorticoid resistance in primary ALL cells.	2009	01	06	J Natl Cancer Inst	Pottier	Nicolas
33788417	10.1002/pbc.29036	Novel risk factors for glucarpidase use in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Hispanic ethnicity, age, and the ABCC4 gene.	Carboxypeptidase G<sub>2</sub> (CPDG<sub>2</sub> ; glucarpidase) is a rescue drug for patients at risk for kidney injury from high-dose methotrexate (MTX). As there are no strategies for predicting patients who will require CDPG<sub>2</sub> , we evaluated the role of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors for CPDG<sub>2</sub> use. Cases who received CPDG<sub>2</sub> and controls who did not were identified by chart review of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received MTX doses between 1000 and 5000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> between 2010 and 2017. We used multivariable Bayesian logistic regression to evaluate the association of CPDG<sub>2</sub> use with demographic and clinical variables and, on a subset of patients, with genetic ancestry and 49 single nucleotide variants previously associated with MTX toxicity. We identified 423 patients who received 1592 doses of MTX. Of the 18 patients who received CPDG<sub>2</sub> , 17 (94%) were Hispanic. No patients who received 1000 or 2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of MTX received CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio: 4.68; 95% compatibility interval: 1.63-15.06) and older age (1.87 [1.17-3.17]) were associated with receiving CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Of the 177 patients in the genomic cohort, 11 received CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Each additional G allele of rs7317112 in ABCC4 increased the odds of requiring CPDG<sub>2</sub> (3.10 [1.12-6.75]). Six other loci (NTRK1/rs10908521, TSG1/rs9345389, STT3B/rs1353327, SCLO1B1/rs4149056, GATA3/rs3824662, ARID5B/rs10821936) demonstrated probabilities of association between 88% and 97%. We demonstrated that demographic characteristics, including Hispanic ethnicity and age, are associated with CPDG<sub>2</sub> use. Additionally, we provide evidence that inherited genetic variation is associated with risk of requiring CPDG<sub>2</sub> . If validated in independent populations, this information could be leveraged to develop targeted toxicity prevention strategies for children with ALL.	2022	03	11	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Zobeck	Mark C
33891562	10.18632/aging.202903	Age-related differences of genetic susceptibility to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Inherited predispositions to acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been well investigated in pediatric patients, but studies on adults, particularly Chinese patients, are limited. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 466 all-age Chinese patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1,466 non-ALL controls to estimate the impact of age on ALL susceptibility in the Chinese population. Among the 17 reported loci, 8 have been validated in pediatric and 1 in adult patients. The strongest association signal was identified at <i>ARID5B</i> locus and gradually decreased with age, while the signal at <i>GATA3</i> exhibited the opposite trend and significantly impact on adult patients. With genome-wide approaches, germline variants at 2q14.3 rank as the top inherited predisposition to adult patients (e.g., rs73956024, <i>P</i> = 4.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and separate the genetic risk of pediatric vs. adult patients (<i>P</i> = 3.6 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), whereas variants at 15q25.3 (e.g., rs11638062) have a similar impact on patients in different age groups (overall <i>P</i> = 2.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Our analysis highlights the impact of age on genetic susceptibility to ALL in Chinese patients.	2021	07	26	Aging (Albany NY)	Hao	Qing
31573954	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0190	<i>ARID5B</i> Influences Antimetabolite Drug Sensitivity and Prognosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Treatment outcomes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved steadily, but a significant proportion of patients still experience relapse due to drug resistance, which is partly explained by inherited and/or somatic genetic alternations. Recently, we and others have identified genetic variants in the <i>ARID5B</i> gene associated with susceptibility to ALL and also with relapse. In this study, we sought to characterize the molecular pathway by which ARID5B affects antileukemic drug response in patients with ALL. We analyzed association of ARID5B expression in primary human ALL blasts with molecular subtypes and treatment outcome. Subsequent mechanistic studies were performed in ALL cell lines by manipulating <i>ARID5B</i> expression isogenically, in which we evaluated drug sensitivity, metabolism, and molecular signaling events. <i>ARID5B</i> expression varied substantially by ALL subtype, with the highest level being observed in hyperdiploid ALL. Lower <i>ARID5B</i> expression at diagnosis was associated with the risk of ALL relapse, and further reduction was noted at ALL relapse. In isogenic ALL cell models <i>in vitro</i>, <i>ARID5B</i> knockdown led to resistance specific to antimetabolite drugs (i.e., 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate), without significantly affecting sensitivity to other antileukemic agents. <i>ARID5B</i> downregulation significantly inhibited ALL cell proliferation and caused partial cell-cycle arrest. At the molecular level, the cell-cycle checkpoint regulator p21 (encoded by <i>CDKN1A</i>) was most consistently modulated by ARID5B, plausibly as its direct transcription regulation target. Our data indicate that ARID5B is an important molecular determinant of antimetabolite drug sensitivity in ALL, in part, through p21-mediated effects on cell-cycle progression.	2020	10	01	Clin Cancer Res	Xu	Heng
31704777	10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106339	Novel phenotypes observed in patients with <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia/familial thrombocytopenia syndrome and a biallelic <i>ARID5B</i> risk allele as leukaemogenic cofactor.	<i>Background.</i> The phenotypes of patients with the recently discovered, dominant, <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome are variable, and the exact mechanism of leukaemogenesis remains unclear. <i>Patients and Methods.</i> Here, we present novel clinical and laboratory phenotypes of seven individuals from three families with <i>ETV6</i> germline mutations and a refined genetic analysis of one child with additional high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL), aiming to elucidate second oncogenic hits. <i>Results.</i> Four individuals from two pedigrees harboured one novel or one previously described variant in the central domain of <i>ETV6</i> (c.592C&gt;T, p.Gln198* or c.641C&gt;T, p.Pro241Leu, respectively). Neutropenia was an accompanying feature in one of these families that also harboured a variant in <i>RUNX1</i> (c.1098_1103dup, p.Ile366_Gly367dup), while in the other, an autism-spectrum disorder was observed. In the third family, the index patient suffered from HD-ALL and life-threatening pulmonary mucor mycosis, and had a positive family history of 'immune' thrombocytopenia. Genetic analyses revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the ETS domain of <i>ETV6</i> (c.1136T&gt;C, p.Leu379Pro) along with absence of heterozygosity of chromosome (10)(q21.2q21.3), yielding a biallelic leukaemia risk allele in <i>ARID5B</i> (rs7090445-C). The neutrophil function was normal in all individuals tested, and the platelet immune histochemistry of all three pedigrees showed delta-storage-pool defect-like features and cytoskeletal defects. <i>Conclusions.</i> Our clinical observations and results of high-resolution genetic analyses extend the spectrum of possible phenotypes cosegregating with <i>ETV6</i> germline mutations. Further, we propose <i>ARID5B</i> as potential leukaemogenic cofactor in patients with <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome.	2021	06	08	J Med Genet	Karastaneva	Anna
31870219	10.1080/08880018.2019.1705949	Association of <i>ABCC2</i> with levels and toxicity of methotrexate in Malaysian Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).	Studies had shown that genetic polymorphism plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics variation of high dose methotrexate (MTX), 5000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> regimen. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic variations associated with the serum level and toxicity of MTX in Malaysian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thirty-eight patients were genotyped for rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>), rs4948496 (<i>ARID5B</i>), rs1801133 (<i>MTHFR</i>) and rs4149056 (<i>SLCO1B1</i>). Serum levels of MTX at 48 h post 24 h of intravenous infusion were analyzed by high<i>-</i>performance liquid chromatography<i>-</i>mass spectrometry. The <i>ABCC2</i> genotype was significantly associated with the serum levels of MTX at 48 h after treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Patients with CT and TT of rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>) and TC and CC of rs4948496 (<i>ARID5B</i>) were significantly associated with leukopenia grade I-IV (Fisher Exact Test; <i>p</i> = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). The three most common MTX related toxicities were leukopenia (60.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase enzyme (47.4%), and thrombocytopenia (47.4%). Our results demonstrate that by prescreening of patients for <i>ABCC2</i> and <i>ARID5B</i> associated with the serum levels and adverse effects of MTX would identify patients at risk and therefore help a pediatric oncologist to personalize chemotherapy drugs for precision health.	2020	11	13	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Razali	Rizal Husaini
32488880	10.1002/jcla.23414	Association of TLX1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Han Chinese children.	Studies on gene polymorphism association are centered on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a common hematological malignancy in children younger than 16 years. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some genes, such as ARID5B and CDKN2B, are associated with the risk of childhood ALL. T-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1), a member of the HOX gene family, was identified based on its abnormal expression in T-lineage leukemia. This study aimed to determine whether TLX1 is associated with B-ALL and which SNP plays a significant role in ALL. A total of 217 cases of ALL and 241 controls were included in this study. Six tag SNPs (rs75329544, rs946328, rs12415670, rs2075879, rs17113735, and rs1051723) were selected, and genotyping was carried out on Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Rs17113735 was possibly the risk locus associated with increased risk for ALL, whereas rs946328 was possibly associated with decreased risk for ALL. Moreover, rs17113735 was likely to be the risk locus for B-cell ALL (B-ALL), and rs2075879 was associated with decreased risk for B-ALL (P &lt; .05). All SNPs in the two sample types (ALL and B-ALL samples) demonstrated linkage disequilibrium except between rs75329544 and rs2075879. Haplotype analysis showed no significant difference between the cases and controls in the two sample types. TLX1 gene polymorphisms are associated with ALL (rs17113735 and rs946328) and possibly play a significant role in B-ALL (rs17113735 and rs2075879). This work provides a reference for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.	2021	07	05	J Clin Lab Anal	Mei	Endian
30770347	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0801	Is There Etiologic Heterogeneity between Subtypes of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? A Review of Variation in Risk by Subtype.	Although substantial advances in the identification of cytogenomic subtypes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been made in recent decades, epidemiologic research characterizing the etiologic heterogeneity of ALL by subtype has not kept pace. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning subtype-specific epidemiologic risk factor associations with ALL subtype defined by immunophenotype (e.g., B-cell vs. T-cell) and cytogenomics (including gross chromosomal events characterized by recurring numerical and structural abnormalities, along with cryptic balanced rearrangements, and focal gene deletions). In case-control analyses investigating nongenetic risk factors, home paint exposure is associated with hyperdiploid, <i>MLL</i>-rearranged, and <i>ETV6</i>-<i>RUNX1</i> subtypes, yet there are few differences in risk factor associations between T- and B-ALL. Although the association between maternal smoking and ALL overall has been null, maternal smoking is associated with an increasing number of gene deletions among cases. GWAS-identified variants in <i>ARID5B</i> have been the most extensively studied and are strongly associated with hyperdiploid B-ALL. <i>GATA3</i> single nucleotide variant rs3824662 shows a strong association with Ph-like ALL (OR = 3.14). However, there have been relatively few population-based studies of adequate sample size to uncover risk factors that may define etiologic heterogeneity between and within the currently defined cytogenomic ALL subtypes.	2020	07	16	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Williams	Lindsay A
30810385	10.1089/gtmb.2018.0283	Association of ARID5B and IKZF1 Variants with Leukemia from Northern India.	Leukemia is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by elevated proliferation of white blood cells. Various genetic studies have assessed the contributory roles of several single nucleotide polymorphisms with the development of leukemia. The role of genetic variation in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes has previously been identified in various population groups; however, the role of these variants in the north Indian populations of Jammu and Kashmir is unknown. In this study, we explored the association of the newly identified genetic variants, rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1, with leukemic patients from Jammu and Kashmir of northern India. The variants were genotyped using TaqMan allele discrimination assays for 616 individuals (210 leukemic cases and 406 healthy controls). The association of each SNP with the disease was evaluated using logistic regression. It was observed that the variants rs6964823 (IKZF1) and rs10740055 (ARID5B) showed significant associations with odds ratio (OR) and p-values of 1.5 (1.0-2.3 at 95% confidence interval [CI]) and 0.04; and 2.5 (1.5-4.1 at 95% CI) and 0.0002, respectively. We also evaluated the cumulative effect for both the variants by combining the risk genotypes and obtained and OR of 4.9. It was found that the variants rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1 act individually and additively as risk factors in the development of leukemia in the populations of Jammu and Kashmir in Northern India.	2019	05	21	Genet Test Mol Biomarkers	Bhat	Amrita
31076442	10.1182/blood.2018874503	The enhancer RNA <i>ARIEL</i> activates the oncogenic transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 regulates the transcriptional program in T-ALL. ARID5B is one of the critical downstream targets of TAL1, which further activates the oncogenic regulatory circuit in T-ALL cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular functions of the noncoding RNA, ARID5B-inducing enhancer associated long noncoding RNA (<i>ARIEL</i>), in T-ALL pathogenesis. We demonstrated that <i>ARIEL</i> is specifically activated in <i>TAL1</i> <sup>+</sup> T-ALL cases, and its expression is associated with <i>ARID5B</i> enhancer activity. <i>ARIEL</i> recruits mediator proteins to the <i>ARID5B</i> enhancer, promotes enhancer-promoter interactions, and activates the expression of <i>ARID5B</i>, thereby positively regulating the TAL1-induced transcriptional program and the <i>MYC</i> oncogene. The TAL1 complex coordinately regulates the expression of <i>ARIEL</i> Knockdown of <i>ARIEL</i> inhibits cell growth and survival of T-ALL cells in culture and blocks disease progression in a murine xenograft model. Our results indicate that <i>ARIEL</i> plays an oncogenic role as an enhancer RNA in T-ALL.	2020	01	14	Blood	Tan	Shi Hao
31111395	10.1007/s12185-019-02658-2	ARID5B gene polymorphisms and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.	Genome-wide association studies have implicated several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) gene in children with ALL; however, whether ARID5B variants (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) are associated with childhood ALL remains controversial. We performed this study to obtain more conclusive results. Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 26 studies were included. Analyses stratified by ethnicity revealed that three polymorphisms are significantly associated with the odds of childhood ALL in Caucasians, and rs10994982 and rs7089424 with the odds of childhood ALL in Asian populations. Furthermore, subtype analyses provided strong evidence that the three polymorphisms are highly associated with the risk of B-cell ALL. Our findings indicate that the ARID5B variants (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) are significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL.	2019	12	11	Int J Hematol	Yang	Ju-Le
31221981	10.1038/s12276-019-0230-6	The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.	Recent studies on mutations in cancer genomes have distinguished driver mutations from passenger mutations, which occur as byproducts of cancer development. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) project identified 299 genes and 24 pathways/biological processes that drive tumor progression (Cell 173: 371-385 e318, 2018). Of the 299 driver genes, 12 genes are involved in histones, histone methylation, and demethylation (Table 1). Among these 12 genes, those encoding the histone demethylases JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A were identified as cancer driver genes. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH)1/2, drive tumor progression by producing an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which is a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate, O<sub>2</sub>-dependent dioxygenases such as Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases, and DNA demethylases. Studies on oncometabolites suggest that histone demethylases mediate metabolic changes in chromatin structure. We have reviewed the most recent findings regarding cancer-specific metabolic reprogramming and the tumor-suppressive roles of JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A. We have also discussed mutations in other isoforms such as the JARID1A, 1B, 1D of KDM5 subfamilies and the JMJD3/KDM6B of KDM6 subfamilies, which play opposing roles in tumor progression as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer cell type.

31227872	10.1007/s00277-019-03730-x	Variants in ARID5B gene are associated with the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Mexican children.	A high impact of ARID5B SNPs on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility has been described in Hispanic children; therefore, it is relevant to know if they influence the high incidence of childhood-ALL in Mexicans. Seven SNPs (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, rs4948488) of ARID5B were analyzed in 384 controls and 298 ALL children using genomic DNA and TaqMan probes. The SNPs were analyzed for deviation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotypic and allelic frequencies between controls and patients. The association between SNPs and ALL susceptibility was calculated, and haplotype and ancestry analyses were conducted. All SNPs were associated with ALL, pre-B ALL, and hyperdiploid-ALL susceptibility (p &lt; 0.05). No association with T-ALL and gene fusions was found (p &gt; 0.05). The seven SNPs were associated with risk of pre-B ALL in younger children; however, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, and rs4948488 were not associated with susceptibility in older children and adolescents. The CAG haplotype (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) was strongly associated with ALL risk in our population (p &lt; 0.00001). The frequency of all risk alleles in our ALL, pre-B, and hyperdiploid-ALL patients was higher than that in Hispanic children reported. This is the first report showing the association between rs2393732, rs2393782, and rs4948488 with pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL children. The G allele at rs2893881 confers major risk for pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL in Mexican (OR, 2.29) than in Hispanic children (OR, 1.71). The genetic background of our population could influence the susceptibility to ALL and explain its high incidence in Mexico.	2019	09	17	Ann Hematol	Reyes-León	Adriana
31274788	10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000038	Genetic polymorphisms of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 are associated with B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Chinese pediatric population.	Several ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were confirmed to be significantly associated with the susceptibility of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on Caucasian populations in previous studies. Similar investigations in Asian populations were less. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between ARID5B SNPs rs7089424, rs10994982, and the risk of ALL in Chinese pediatric population. A total of 190 pediatric ALL patients and 270 controls were enrolled in this study. PCR amplification combined with mass spectrometry were used to evaluate the genotypes of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982. χ test was used in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the SNPs for analyzing statistical differences between patients and controls. There were significant differences in the risk allele frequencies of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 between B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients and controls (rs7089424, G allele: p = 0.001; rs10994982, A allele: p = 0.000). The genotype distributions of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 were also statistically different in B-ALL patients compared with controls (rs7089424, p = 0.004; rs10994982, p = 0.001). Further analyzing the relevance of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 genotypes to clinical risk classification of ALL showed GG genotype of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 were strikingly correlated with the medium-risk and low-risk groups of B-ALL. Finally, GG and GT genotypes of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 seemed to be responsible for the hyperdiploid subtype susceptibility of childhood B-ALL. ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 might serve as genetic susceptibility markers for B-ALL in Chinese pediatric population. Moreover, the two ARID5B SNPs are associated with the risk of B-hyperdiploid ALL, which had a better therapeutic response than other ALL subtypes.	2020	06	23	J Chin Med Assoc	Tao	Ran
31350265	10.1182/blood.2018890764	Inherited genetic susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome.	Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 20-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and distinct somatic features, including CRLF2 rearrangement in ∼50% of cases; however, the role of inherited genetic variation in DS-ALL susceptibility is unknown. We report the first genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, comprising a meta-analysis of 4 independent studies, with 542 DS-ALL cases and 1192 DS controls. We identified 4 susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance: rs58923657 near IKZF1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; Pmeta = 5.32 × 10-15), rs3731249 in CDKN2A (OR, 3.63; Pmeta = 3.91 × 10-10), rs7090445 in ARID5B (OR, 1.60; Pmeta = 8.44 × 10-9), and rs3781093 in GATA3 (OR, 1.73; Pmeta = 2.89 × 10-8). We performed DS-ALL vs non-DS ALL case-case analyses, comparing risk allele frequencies at these and other established susceptibility loci (BMI1, PIP4K2A, and CEBPE) and found significant association with DS status for CDKN2A (OR, 1.58; Pmeta = 4.1 × 10-4). This association was maintained in separate regression models, both adjusting for and stratifying on CRLF2 overexpression and other molecular subgroups, indicating an increased penetrance of CDKN2A risk alleles in children with DS. Finally, we investigated functional significance of the IKZF1 risk locus, and demonstrated mapping to a B-cell super-enhancer, and risk allele association with decreased enhancer activity and differential protein binding. IKZF1 knockdown resulted in significantly higher proliferation in DS than non-DS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate a higher penetrance of the CDKN2A risk locus in DS and serve as a basis for further biological insights into DS-ALL etiology.	2020	02	03	Blood	Brown	Austin L

We investigated the association between the <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 C &gt; T, rs10994982 A &gt; G, and susceptibility to ALL in a cohort of Egyptian individuals and investigated their role in relation to disease outcome. Real-time PCR typing was done for <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and rs10994982 SNPs for 128 pediatric ALL (pALL), 45 adult ALL (aALL), and 436 healthy controls. Significant risk associations were found between the C allele (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.02), CC genotype (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.72), CT genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.011, OR = 1.45) of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and pediatric ALL especially T-ALL and adult ALL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The CA haplotype (C allele of rs10821936 + A allele of rs10994982) was associated with the risk of ALL either pediatric ALL or adult ALL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In the studied Egyptian population, it can be concluded that the C allele, CC, and CT genotypes of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and the CA haplotype may be a susceptibility risk factor for pediatric and adult ALL. However, the SNPs of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and rs10994982 were not found to be strongly associated with ALL outcomes.	2020	04	09	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Mosaad	Youssef M

29335448	10.1038/s41598-017-19127-7	Regional evaluation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia genetic susceptibility loci among Japanese.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed mostly in populations of European and Hispanic ancestry have confirmed an inherited genetic basis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but these associations are less clear in other races/ethnicities. DNA samples from ALL patients (aged 0-19 years) previously enrolled onto a Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group trial were collected during 2013-2015, and underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping resulting in 527 B-cell ALL for analysis. Cases and control data for 3,882 samples from the Nagahama Study Group and Aichi Cancer Center Study were combined, and association analyses across 10 previous GWAS-identified regions were performed after targeted SNP imputation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in Japanese and other populations were evaluated using the varLD score based on 1000 Genomes data. Risk associations for ARID5B (rs10821936, OR = 1.84, P = 6 × 10<sup>-17</sup>) and PIP4K2A (rs7088318, OR = 0.76, P = 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) directly transferred to Japanese, and the IKZF1 association was detected by an alternate SNP (rs1451367, OR = 1.52, P = 2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Marked regional LD differences between Japanese and Europeans was observed for most of the remaining loci for which associations did not transfer, including CEBPE, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and ELK3. This study represents a first step towards characterizing the role of genetic susceptibility in childhood ALL risk in Japanese.	2018	11	20	Sci Rep	Urayama	Kevin Y
29504848	10.1080/08916934.2018.1446525	Signalling pathways identified in salivary glands from primary Sjögren's syndrome patients reveal enhanced adipose tissue development.	A characteristic feature of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is the destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands mediated by mononuclear cell infiltration. Adipocytes can also occupy a large portion of the salivary gland (SG) tissue area, although little is known about their significance in pSS. We have previously investigated adipose tissue infiltration in SG biopsies from pSS patients and non-SS sicca controls. Our findings indicated the distinct incidence of adipose tissue replacement in pSS patients, where adipocytes were detected in interleukin (IL) 6 rich regions. We now aimed to examine the development of adipocytes in the SG microenvironment, and delineate their possible involvement in immune reactions. A microarray analysis was performed on SG from 6 pSS patients and 6 non-SS controls, where the expression levels of genes involved in adipose tissue development, inflammatory responses, and lymphoma development were assessed. Real-time PCR was carried out on SG from 14 pSS patients and 15 non-SS controls to account for IL6, IL10, and IL17 mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen SG tissue using IL17 was also conducted. Our results indicate signalling pathways identified in SG of pSS patients displayed genes leading to prominent adipose tissue development and reduced mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (ARID5B, OXCT1, BDH1, SOX8, HMGCS2, FTO, ECHS1, PCCA, ACADL and ACADVL), inflammatory responses (IL1R1, IL7R, IL10RA, IL15, IL18RAP, CCL2, CCL5, CCL22, CXCR6, CD14, and CD48), and lymphoma development via JAK-STAT signalling (STAT2, TYK2, EBI3, FAS, TNFRSF1B, MAP3K8, HMOX1, LTB, TNF, STAT1, and BAK1). Genes involved in interferon production and signalling were also detected (IRF1, IRF9, and IRF7), in addition to IL6, IL10, and IL17. Higher mRNA levels of IL6, IL17 and IL10 were observed in the SG of pSS patients compared to controls. Moreover, IL17 positive cells were detected mostly interstitially in the SG and around adipocytes, also within the focal infiltrates. In conclusion, adipocyte development seems to be more prominent in the SG of pSS patients, where adipose tissue replacement is also evident. Whether this is due to disease progression, or the repair process, remains to be investigated. Detection of IL17 positive adipocytes in the target organ suggests their involvement in immune reactions.	2019	10	03	Autoimmunity	Aqrawi	Lara A
29654272	10.1038/s41375-018-0110-4	Identification of novel lncRNAs regulated by the TAL1 complex in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB) positively regulate each other and coordinately regulate the expression of their downstream target genes in T-ALL cells. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells. This included a known lncRNA (lnc-OAZ3-2:7) located near the RORC gene, which was expressed in normal thymocytes but repressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cells.	2019	06	13	Leukemia	Ngoc	Phuong Cao Thi
28256501	10.1038/ncomms14616	Genetic and regulatory mechanism of susceptibility to high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at 10p21.2.	Despite high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL) being the most common subgroup of paediatric ALL, its aetiology remains unknown. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated association at 10q21.2. Here, we sought to determine how this region influences HD-ALL risk. We impute genotypes across the locus, finding the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7090445 highly associated with HD-ALL (P=1.54 × 10<sup>-38</sup>), and residing in a predicted enhancer element. We show this region physically interacts with the transcription start site of ARID5B, that alleles of rs7090445 have differential enhancer activity and influence RUNX3 binding. RUNX3 knock-down reduces ARID5B expression and rs7090445 enhancer activity. Individuals carrying the rs7090445-C risk allele also have reduced ARID5B expression. Finally, the rs7090445-C risk allele is preferentially retained in HD-ALL blasts consistent with inherited genetic variation contributing to arrest of normal lymphocyte development, facilitating leukaemic clonal expansion. These data provide evidence for a biological mechanism underlying hereditary risk of HD-ALL at 10q21.2.	2018	12	11	Nat Commun	Studd	James B
28381164	10.1177/1010428317697573	Association of ARID5B gene variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children.	Studies have shown an association between ARID5B gene polymorphisms and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the association between ARID5B variants and acute lymphoblastic leukemia among the Arab population still needs to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ARID5B variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children. A total of 14 ARID5B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 289 Yemeni children, of whom 136 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 153 were controls, using the nanofluidic Dynamic Array (Fluidigm 192.24 Dynamic Array). Using logistic regression adjusted for age and gender, the risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We found that nine SNPs were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under additive genetic models: rs7073837, rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10821936, rs4506592, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. Furthermore, the recessive models revealed that six SNPs were risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. The gender-specific impact of these SNPs under the recessive genetic model revealed that SNPs rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs6479779 in females, and rs10821938 and rs7923074 in males were significantly associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk. Under the dominant model, SNPs rs7073837, rs10821936, rs7896246, and rs6479778 in males only showed striking association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The additive model revealed that SNPs with significant association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were rs10821936 (both males and females); rs7073837, rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs4948487 (females only); and rs7089424, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074 (males only). In addition, the ARID5B haplotype block (CGAACACAA) showed a higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The haplotype (CCCGACTGC) was associated with protection against acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In conclusion, our study has shown that ARID5B variants are associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children with several gender biases of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms reported.	2017	04	18	Tumour Biol	Al-Absi	Boshra
28751478	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-0360	Novel Gene and Network Associations Found for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Using Case-Control and Family-Based Studies in Multiethnic Populations.	<b>Background:</b> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, suggesting that germline variants influence ALL risk. Although multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified variants predisposing children to ALL, it remains unclear whether genetic heterogeneity affects ALL susceptibility and how interactions within and among genes containing ALL-associated variants influence ALL risk.<b>Methods:</b> Here, we jointly analyzed two published datasets of case-control GWA summary statistics along with germline data from ALL case-parent trios. We used the gene-level association method PEGASUS to identify genes with multiple variants associated with ALL. We then used PEGASUS gene scores as input to the network analysis algorithm HotNet2 to characterize the genomic architecture of ALL.<b>Results:</b> Using PEGASUS, we confirmed associations previously observed at genes such as <i>ARID5B, IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B</i>, and <i>PIP4K2A</i>, and we identified novel candidate gene associations. Using HotNet2, we uncovered significant gene subnetworks that may underlie inherited ALL risk: a subnetwork involved in B-cell differentiation containing the ALL-associated gene <i>CEBPE</i>, and a subnetwork of homeobox genes, including <i>MEIS1</i><b>Conclusions:</b> Gene and network analysis uncovered loci associated with ALL that are missed by GWA studies, such as <i>MEIS1</i> Furthermore, ALL-associated loci do not appear to interact directly with each other to influence ALL risk, and instead appear to influence leukemogenesis through multiple, complex pathways.<b>Impact:</b> We present a new pipeline for <i>post hoc</i> analysis of association studies that yields new insight into the etiology of ALL and can be applied in future studies to shed light on the genomic underpinnings of cancer. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(10); 1531-9. ©2017 AACR</i>.	2018	05	29	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Nakka	Priyanka
28817678	10.1371/journal.pone.0180488	Family-based exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia among Hispanics confirms role of ARID5B in susceptibility.	We conducted an exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among Hispanics to confirm and identify novel variants associated with disease risk in this population. We used a case-parent trio study design; unlike more commonly used case-control studies, this study design is ideal for avoiding issues with population stratification bias among this at-risk ethnic group. Using 710 individuals from 323 Guatemalan and US Hispanic families, two inherited SNPs in ARID5B reached genome-wide level significance: rs10821936, RR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.70-3.14, p = 1.7×10-8 and rs7089424, RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.64-3.01, p = 5.2×10-8. Similar results were observed when restricting our analyses to those with the B-ALL subtype: ARID5B rs10821936 RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.02, p = 9.63×10-8 and ARID5B rs7089424 RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.57-2.88, p = 2.81×10-7. Notably, effect sizes observed for rs7089424 and rs10821936 in our study were &gt;20% higher than those reported among non-Hispanic white populations in previous genetic association studies. Our results confirmed the role of ARID5B in childhood ALL susceptibility among Hispanics; however, our assessment did not reveal any strong novel inherited genetic risks for acute lymphoblastic leukemia among this ethnic group.	2017	10	18	PLoS One	Archer	Natalie P
28905228	10.1007/s12032-017-1038-7	Genetic susceptibility in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and a leading cause of death due to disease in children. The genetic basis of ALL susceptibility has been supported by its association with certain congenital disorders and, more recently, by several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These GWAS identified common variants in ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, LHPP and ELK3 influencing ALL risk. However, the risk variants of these SNPs were not validated in all populations, suggesting that some of the loci could be population specific. On the other hand, the currently identified risk SNPs in these genes only account for 19% of the additive heritable risk. This estimation indicates that additional susceptibility variants could be discovered. In this review, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in genetic susceptibility of childhood ALL in all GWAS and subsequent studies and we will also point to future directions that could be explored in the near future.	2018	05	09	Med Oncol	Gutierrez-Camino	Angela
29326336	10.1101/gad.302646.117	ARID5B as a critical downstream target of the TAL1 complex that activates the oncogenic transcriptional program and promotes T-cell leukemogenesis.	The oncogenic transcription factor <i>TAL1/SCL</i> induces an aberrant transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. However, the critical factors that are directly activated by TAL1 and contribute to T-ALL pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identified <i>AT-rich interactive domain 5B</i> (<i>ARID5B</i>) as a collaborating oncogenic factor involved in the transcriptional program in T-ALL. <i>ARID5B</i> expression is down-regulated at the double-negative 2-4 stages in normal thymocytes, while it is induced by the TAL1 complex in human T-ALL cells. The enhancer located 135 kb upstream of the <i>ARID5B</i> gene locus is activated under a superenhancer in T-ALL cells but not in normal T cells. Notably, ARID5B-bound regions are associated predominantly with active transcription. ARID5B and TAL1 frequently co-occupy target genes and coordinately control their expression. ARID5B positively regulates the expression of TAL1 and its regulatory partners. ARID5B also activates the expression of the oncogene <i>MYC</i> Importantly, ARID5B is required for the survival and growth of T-ALL cells<i>,</i> and forced expression of ARID5B in immature thymocytes results in thymus retention, differentiation arrest, radioresistance, and tumor formation in zebrafish. Our results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and <i>MYC</i> in T-ALL, thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.	2018	02	08	Genes Dev	Leong	Wei Zhong
26941364	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0528	Pathway Analysis of Genome-wide Association Study in Childhood Leukemia among Hispanics.	The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is nearly 20% higher among Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites. Previous studies have shown evidence for association between risk of ALL and variation within IKZF1, ARID5B, CEBPE, CDKN2A, GATA3, and BM1-PIP4K2A genes. However, variants identified only account for &lt;10% of the genetic risk of ALL. We applied pathway-based analyses to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biologic pathways were overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among SNPs. Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may involve distinct biologic mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and focal adhesion (PFDR &lt; 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell malignancies. Several candidate genes for ALL, such as COL6A6 and COL5A1, were identified through targeted maximum likelihood estimation. This is the first study to show distinct biologic pathways are overrepresented in different ALL subtypes using pathway-based approaches, and identified potential gene candidates using causal inference methods. The findings demonstrate that newly developed bioinformatics tools and causal inference methods can provide insights to furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia.

27184773	10.3109/08880018.2016.1161685	Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, CDKN2A, and CEBPE with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Tunisian children and their contribution to racial differences in leukemia incidence.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focusing on pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2), CDKN2A (9p21.3), and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly associated to the risk of developing pediatric ALL. These studies have been conducted in European and Thai populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of pediatric ALL. In order to explore the impact of these variants on pediatric ALL risk in the Tunisian population, we genotyped 58 cases of pediatric ALL and 150 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs7089424 (10q21.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Our results, which are consistent with findings in European populations, show that 3 SNPs, i.e., rs4132601 (P = .00116, odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.42, 5.87]), rs7089424 (P = .0022, OR = 0.49, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.79]), and rs2239633 (P = .0010, OR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.75]) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing pediatric ALL (P &lt; .05). Furthermore, we show differences in allele frequencies in SNPs between Tunisian and Caucasian and/or Thai populations (e.g., CEBPE, rs2239633; population attributable risk [PAR] ∼15-fold the PAR of Thai population). These differences, combined with differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between populations and differences in size between populations, may contribute to racial differences in pediatric ALL incidence. 	2017	04	07	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Gharbi	Hanene
27644650		Association of Genetic Variants in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with Risk of Childhood de novo B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in India.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous genetic disease and its etiology remains poorly understood. Recent genome wide association and replication studies have highlighted specic polymorphisms contributing to childhood ALL predispositions mostly in European populations. It is unclear if these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of ALL. The current case-control study evaluated variants in ARID5B (rs7089424, rs10821936), IKZF1 (rs4132601) and CEBPE (rs2239633) genes, which appear most significantly associated with risk of developing childhood B-lineage ALL. Using TaqMan assays, genotyping was conducted for 162 de novo B-lineage ALL cases and 150 unrelated healthy controls in India. Appropriate statistical methods were applied. Genotypic and allelic frequencies differed significantly between cases and controls at IKZF1-rs4132601 (p=0.039, p=0.015) and ARID5B-rs10821936 (p=0.028, p=0.026). Both rs10821936 (p=0.019; OR 0.67; 95% CI=0.47-0.94) and rs4132601 (p=0.018; OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.48-0.94) were associated with reduced disease risk. Moreover, gender- analysis revealed male-specific risk associations for rs10821936 (p=0.041 CT+CC) and rs4132601 (p=0.005 G allele). Further, ARID5B-rs7089424 and CEBPE-rs2239633 showed a trend towards decreased disease risk but without significance (p=0.073; p=0.73). Our findings provide the rst evidence that SNPs ARID5B- rs10821936 and IKZF1-rs4132601 are associated with decreased B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Indian children. Understanding the effects of these variants in different ethnic groups is crucial as they may confer different risk of ALL within different populations.	2017	02	02	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Bhandari	Prerana
28476190	10.1016/j.arcmed.2016.12.003	ARID5B, CEBPE and PIP4K2A Germline Genetic Polymorphisms and Risk of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Mexican Patients: A MIGICCL Study.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of childhood cancer-related deaths worldwide. Multiples studies have shown that ALL seems to be originated by an interaction between environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. The ARID5B polymorphisms are among the most reproducible ALL associated-risk alleles in different populations. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of ARID5B, CEBPE, and PIP4K2 risk alleles for the development of ALL in children from Mexico City and Yucatan, Mexico. A study was conducted with a total of 761 unrelated subjects. Two hundred eighty five ALL cases (111 from Yucatan and 174 from Mexico City) and 476 healthy subjects. Genotyping included the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A), rs10821936 (ARID5B), rs7089424 (ARID5B) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms. Associations between ALL and rs10821936 and rs7089424 ARID5B SNPs were found (OR = 1.9, 95% CI (1.5-2.4) and OR = 2.0, 95% CI (1.6-2.5), respectively). Moreover, a higher risk was observed in the homozygous risk genotypes of carriers from Mexico City (OR = 3.1, 95% CI (2.0-4.9) and OR 3.1, CI 95% (2.0-4.8), respectively). Otherwise, the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms were not associated with ALL risk. Our analysis suggests that ARID5B confers risk for childhood ALL in a Mexican population.	2017	07	06	Arch Med Res	Bekker-Méndez	Vilma Carolina
24707947	10.3109/10428194.2014.910662	Genetic markers in a multi-ethnic sample for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk.	Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple risk loci for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but mostly in European/White populations, despite Hispanics having a greater risk. We re-examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of known associations with childhood ALL and known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region lymphoma risk markers in a multi-ethnic population. Significant associations were found in two ARID5B variants (rs7089424 and rs10821936). We replicated a strong risk association in non-Hispanic White males with rs2395185, a protective marker for lymphoma. Another HLA region marker, rs2647012, showed a risk association among Hispanics only, while a strong protective association was found with rs1048456, a follicular lymphoma risk marker. Our study validated this new case-control sample by confirming genetic markers associated with childhood ALL, and yielded new associations with lymphoma markers. Despite positive results, our study did not provide any clues as to why Hispanics have a higher susceptibility to childhood leukemia, suggesting that environmental factors may have a strong contribution.	2015	10	07	Leuk Lymphoma	Kennedy	Amy E

25150625	10.1016/j.bcmd.2014.07.011	Concordant B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in non-twinned siblings.	Associating the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with genetic predisposition is still a challenge. Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1 usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53, and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found in the parents. Altogether, our data suggest that genetic predisposition aligned with chance haa an additive effect in BCP-ALL outcome.	2015	07	29	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Pombo-de-Oliveira	Maria S
25761407	10.1007/s10552-015-0550-3	Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and surrogates for early-life infections with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanic children.	Genome-wide association studies focusing on European-ancestry populations have identified ALL risk loci on IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. To capture the impacts of these genes on ALL risk in the California Hispanic population, we comprehensively assessed the variation within the genes and further assessed the joint effects between the genetic variation and surrogates for early-life infections (the presence of older siblings, daycare attendance, and ear infections). Genotypic data for 323 Hispanic ALL cases and 454 controls from the California Childhood Leukemia Study were generated using Illumina OmniExpress v1 platform. Logistic regression assuming a log-additive model estimated odds ratios (OR) associated with each SNP, adjusted for age, sex, and the first five principal components. In addition, we examined potential interactions between six ALL risk alleles and surrogates for early-life infections using logistic regression models that included an interaction term. Significant associations between genotypes at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and ALL risk were identified: rs7780012, OR 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.71 (p = 0.004); rs7089424, OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.65 (p = 1.16 × 10(-9)); rs4982731, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.37-2.08 (p = 2.35 × 10(-6)), respectively. Evidence for multiplicative interactions between genetic variants and surrogates for early-life infections with ALL risk was not observed. Consistent with findings in non-Hispanic White population, our study showed that variants within IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE were associated with increased ALL risk, and the effects for ARID5B and CEBPE were most prominent in the high-hyperdiploid ALL subtype in the California Hispanic population. Results implicate the ARID5B, CEBPE, and IKZF1 genes in the pathogenesis of childhood ALL.	2016	03	21	Cancer Causes Control	Hsu	Ling-I
25806972	10.1371/journal.pone.0121348	ARID5B, IKZF1 and non-genetic factors in the etiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: the ESCALE study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified that frequent polymorphisms in ARID5B and IKZF1, two genes involved in lymphoid differentiation, increase the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These findings markedly modified the current field of research on the etiology of ALL. In this new context, the present exploratory study investigated the possible interactions between these at-risk alleles and the non-genetic suspected ALL risk factors that were of sufficient prevalence in the French ESCALE study: maternal use of home insecticides during pregnancy, preconception paternal smoking, and some proxies for early immune modulation, i.e. breastfeeding, history of common infections before age one year, and birth order. The analyses were based on 434 ALL cases and 442 controls of European origin, drawn from the nationwide population-based case-control study ESCALE. Information on non-genetic factors was obtained by standardized telephone interview. Interactions between rs10740055 in ARID5B or rs4132601 in IKZF1 and each of the suspected non-genetic factors were tested, with the SNPs coded as counts of minor alleles (trend variable). Statistical interactions were observed between rs4132601 and maternal insecticide use (p = 0.012), breastfeeding p = 0.017) and repeated early common infections (p = 0.0070), with allelic odds ratios (OR) which were only increased among the children not exposed to insecticides (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.4), those who had been breastfed (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.5) and those who had had repeated early common infections (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.5, 3.8). The allelic ORs were close to one among children exposed to insecticides, who had not been breastfed and who had had no or few common infections. Repeated early common infections interacted with rs10740055 (p = 0.018) in the case-only design. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these observations of a modification of the effect of the at-risk alleles by non-genetic factors are chance findings or reflect true underlying mechanisms. 	2016	02	17	PLoS One	Rudant	Jérémie
26104880	10.1038/ncomms8553	Inherited coding variants at the CDKN2A locus influence susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children.	There is increasing evidence from genome-wide association studies for a strong inherited genetic basis of susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, yet the effects of protein-coding variants on ALL risk have not been systematically evaluated. Here we show a missense variant in CDKN2A associated with the development of ALL at genome-wide significance (rs3731249, P=9.4 × 10(-23), odds ratio=2.23). Functional studies indicate that this hypomorphic variant results in reduced tumour suppressor function of p16(INK4A), increases the susceptibility to leukaemic transformation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, and is preferentially retained in ALL tumour cells. Resequencing the CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus in 2,407 childhood ALL cases reveals 19 additional putative functional germline variants. These results provide direct functional evidence for the influence of inherited genetic variation on ALL risk, highlighting the important and complex roles of CDKN2A-CDKN2B tumour suppressors in leukaemogenesis. 	2016	04	05	Nat Commun	Xu	Heng
26575185	10.1371/journal.pone.0143343	Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test Using ddPCR (SMART-ddPCR): An Accurate Method for Assessment of Preferential Allelic Imbalance in Tumor DNA.	The extent to which heritable genetic variants can affect tumor development has yet to be fully elucidated. Tumor selection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles, a phenomenon called preferential allelic imbalance (PAI), has been demonstrated in some cancer types. We developed a novel application of digital PCR termed Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test using Droplet Digital PCR (SMART-ddPCR) for accurate assessment of tumor PAI, and have applied this method to test the hypothesis that heritable SNPs associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may demonstrate tumor PAI. These SNPs are located at CDKN2A (rs3731217) and IKZF1 (rs4132601), genes frequently lost in ALL, and at CEBPE (rs2239633), ARID5B (rs7089424), PIP4K2A (rs10764338), and GATA3 (rs3824662), genes located on chromosomes gained in high-hyperdiploid ALL. We established thresholds of AI using constitutional DNA from SNP heterozygotes, and subsequently measured allelic copy number in tumor DNA from 19-142 heterozygote samples per SNP locus. We did not find significant tumor PAI at these loci, though CDKN2A and IKZF1 SNPs showed a trend towards preferential selection of the risk allele (p = 0.17 and p = 0.23, respectively). Using a genomic copy number control ddPCR assay, we investigated somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) underlying AI at CDKN2A and IKZF1, revealing a complex range of alterations including homozygous and hemizygous deletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, with varying degrees of clonality. Copy number estimates from ddPCR showed high agreement with those from multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assays. We demonstrate that SMART-ddPCR is a highly accurate method for investigation of tumor PAI and for assessment of the somatic alterations underlying AI. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified 16 recurrent SCNA loci that contain heritable cancer risk SNPs associated with a matching tumor type, and which represent candidate PAI regions warranting further investigation. 	2016	06	28	PLoS One	de Smith	Adam J
23975371	10.1007/s13277-013-1097-0	ARID5B gene rs10821936 polymorphism is associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis based on 39,116 subjects.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children. Two recent genome-wide association studies and several replicated studies have provided convincing evidence that inherited genetic variation in ARID5B contributes to childhood ALL predisposition. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the association between ARID5B genetic polymorphism and the risk for ALL. We conducted a search of case-control studies on the association of ARID5B genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to ALL in PubMed, EMBASE, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data from eligible studies were extracted for meta-analysis. ALL risk associated with ARID5B genetic polymorphism was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Nine articles including 13 case-control studies were included in the present meta-analysis. We found that rs10821936 polymorphism in ARID5B gene was associated with increased risk for ALL (P &lt; 0.0001; OR = 1.27; 95%CI, 1.17-1.37). This meta-analysis suggests that ARID5B genetic polymorphism was associated with the increased risk of ALL.	2014	03	26	Tumour Biol	Guo	Lei-Ming
24200646	10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.10.003	High-resolution melting analyses for genetic variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility loci in Taiwan.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a heterogeneous disease that includes multiple subtypes is defined by cell lineage and chromosome anomalies. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several ARID5B and IKZF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of ALL. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and convenient technique to detect SNPs; we thereby detected SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We enrolled 79 pediatric ALL patients and 80 healthy controls. Polymorphic variants of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs7073837, rs10740055, and rs7089424) were detected by HRM, and SNPs were analyzed for association with childhood ALL. The distribution of genotype rs7073837 in ARID5B significantly differed between ALL and controls (P=0.046), while those of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs10740055 and rs7089424) did not. We analyzed the association for SNPs with B lineage ALL to find rs7073837 in ARID5B, conferring a higher risk for B lineage ALL (odds ratio, OR=1.70, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.01-2.87, P=0.049). HRM is a practical method to detect SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We found that rs7073837 in ARID5B correlated with a risk for childhood B lineage ALL.	2014	08	13	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Lin	Chien-Yu

24712521	10.1111/bjh.12886	Associations of novel genetic variations in the folate-related and ARID5B genes with the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of high-dose methotrexate in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.	High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) plays an important role in the consolidation therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in many treatment regimens worldwide. However, there is a large interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the drug. We investigated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the folate metabolic pathway, transporter molecules and transcription proteins on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of MTX and 7-hydroxy-methotrexate (7-OH-MTX). 63 SNPs of 14 genes were genotyped and a total of 463 HD-MTX courses (administered according to the ALL-BFM 95 and ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocols) were analysed. Haematological, hepatic and renal toxicities, estimated by routine laboratory parameters were evaluated. Random forest and regression trees were used for variable selection and model building. Linear mixed models were established to prove the significance of the selected variables. SNPs (rs4948502, rs4948496, rs4948487) of the ARID5B gene were associated with the serum levels of MTX (P &lt; 0·02), serum levels and area under the curve of 7-OH-MTX (P &lt; 0·02) and with hypoproteinaemia (P = 0·004). SLCO1B1 rs4149056 also showed a significant association with serum MTX levels (P &lt; 0·001). Our findings confirm the association of novel genetic variations in folate-related and ARID5B genes with the serum MTX levels and acute toxicity.	2014	10	09	Br J Haematol	Csordas	Katalin
24753091	10.1002/ajh.23727	Genomic ancestry and somatic alterations correlate with age at diagnosis in Hispanic children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Hispanic children have a higher incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than non-Hispanic whites but tend to be diagnosed at older ages. In genome-wide association studies, Native American ancestry and polymorphisms in six genes have been associated with ALL risk. In multivariable regression models, we investigated whether genomic ancestry, inherited risk SNPs, or acquired somatic alterations were associated with differences in age at diagnosis in Hispanic children with B-cell ALL. Genome-wide array data were used to estimate each participant's percent membership in the three Hispanic ancestral populations: Native American, African, and European. Each 20% increase in European ancestry was associated with a six month younger age at diagnosis (95% CI = 0.36-11.6 months, P = 0.037). Correspondingly, each 20% increase in Native American ancestry was associated with a six-month older age at diagnosis (P = 0.037). Both the TEL-AML1 translocation and high-hyperdiploidy were associated with younger age at diagnosis (24.4 months, P = 2.0 x 10(-4) and 12.4 months, P = 0.011, respectively), while CDKN2A and IKZF1 deletions were associated with older age at diagnosis (19.7 months, P = 7.0 x 10(-4) and 18.1 months, P = 0.012, respectively). No associations with age at diagnosis were observed for RAS mutation, PAX5 deletion or for known heritable risk alleles in IKZF1, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, GATA3, ARID5B, or CEBPE. Because younger age at diagnosis is associated with improved treatment outcomes for children with ALL, the effect of European ancestry on ALL survival may be mediated by its effect on age at diagnosis, or by proxy, its association with more treatable molecular subtypes of ALL.	2014	10	09	Am J Hematol	Walsh	Kyle M
25096228	10.1159/000363660	A new system identification approach to identify genetic variants in sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.	We propose in this paper a set-valued (SV) system model, which is a generalized form of logistic (LG) and Probit (Probit) regression, to be considered as a method for discovering genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants in next-generation sequencing studies, for a binary phenotype. We propose a new SV system identification method to estimate all underlying key system parameters for the Probit model and compare it with the LG model in the setting of genetic association studies. Across an extensive series of simulation studies, the Probit method maintained type I error control and had similar or greater power than the LG method, which is robust to different distributions of noise: logistic, normal, or t distributions. Additionally, the Probit association parameter estimate was 2.7-46.8-fold less variable than the LG log-odds ratio association parameter estimate. Less variability in the association parameter estimate translates to greater power and robustness across the spectrum of minor allele frequencies (MAFs), and these advantages are the most pronounced for rare variants. For instance, in a simulation that generated data from an additive logistic model with an odds ratio of 7.4 for a rare single nucleotide polymorphism with a MAF of 0.005 and a sample size of 2,300, the Probit method had 60% power whereas the LG method had 25% power at the α = 10(-6) level. Consistent with these simulation results, the set of variants identified by the LG method was a subset of those identified by the Probit method in two example analyses. Thus, we suggest the Probit method may be a competitive alternative to the LG method in genetic association studies such as candidate gene, genome-wide, or next-generation sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.	2015	04	23	Hum Hered	Kang	Guolian
25124600	10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.15.6211	Associations between AT-rich interactive domain 5B gene polymorphisms and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, replicated studies reported some inconsistent results in different populations. Using meta-analysis, we here aimed to clarify the nature of the genetic risks contributed by the two polymorphisms (rs10994982, rs7089424) for developing childhood ALL. Through searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and manually searching relevant references, a total of 14 articles with 16 independent studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to assess the associations. Both SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 showed significant associations with childhood ALL risk in all genetic models after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, subtype analyses of B-lineage ALL provided strong evidence that SNP rs10994982 is highly associated with the risk of developing B-hyperdiploid ALL. These results indicate that SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 are indeed significantly associated with increased risk of childhood ALL. 	2017	01	24	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Zeng	Hui

25310577	10.1371/journal.pone.0110255	Confirmation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia variants, ARID5B and IKZF1, and interaction with parental environmental exposures.	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have established association of ARID5B and IKZF1 variants with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors alone appear to make a relatively minor contribution to disease risk. The polygenic nature of childhood ALL predisposition together with the timing of environmental triggers may hold vital clues for disease etiology. This study presents results from an Australian GWAS of childhood ALL cases (n = 358) and population controls (n = 1192). Furthermore, we utilised family trio (n = 204) genotypes to extend our investigation to gene-environment interaction of significant loci with parental exposures before conception, and child's sex and age. Thirteen SNPs achieved genome wide significance in the population based case/control analysis; ten annotated to ARID5B and three to IKZF1. The most significant SNPs in these regions were ARID5B rs4245595 (OR 1.63, CI 1.38-1.93, P = 2.13×10(-9)), and IKZF1 rs1110701 (OR 1.69, CI 1.42-2.02, p = 7.26×10(-9)). There was evidence of gene-environment interaction for risk genotype at IKZF1, whereby an apparently stronger genetic effect was observed if the mother took folic acid or if the father did not smoke prior to pregnancy (respective interaction P-values: 0.04, 0.05). There were no interactions of risk genotypes with age or sex (P-values &gt;0.2). Our results evidence that interaction of genetic variants and environmental exposures may further alter risk of childhood ALL however, investigation in a larger population is required. If interaction of folic acid supplementation and IKZF1 variants holds, it may be useful to quantify folate levels prior to initiating use of folic acid supplements.	2015	09	17	PLoS One	Evans	Tiffany-Jane
22422485	10.1002/pbc.24131	Genetic variants modify susceptibility to leukemia in infants: a Children's Oncology Group report.	The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is commonly rearranged in infant leukemia (IL). Genetic determinants of susceptibility to IL are unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have identified susceptibility loci at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. We genotyped these loci in 171 infants with leukemia and 384 controls and evaluated associations overall, by subtype [ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)], and by presence (+) or absence (-) of MLL rearrangements. Homozygosity for a variant IKZF1 allele (rs11978267) increased risk of infant AML [Odds ratio (OR) = 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-8.4]; the increased risk was similar for AML/MLL+ and MLL- cases. In contrast, risk of ALL/MLL- was increased in infants homozygous for the IKZF1 variant (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.8-14.5) but the variant did not modify risk of ALL/MLL+. For ARID5B (rs10821936), homozygosity for the variant allele increased risk for the ALL/MLL- subgroup only (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 2.5-20.6). There was little evidence of an association with the CEBP variant (rs2239633). IKZF1 is expressed in early hematopoiesis, including precursor myeloid cells. Our data provide the first evidence that IKZF1 modifies susceptibility to infant AML, irrespective of MLL rearrangements, and could provide important new etiologic insights into this rare and heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy.	2013	03	07	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Ross	Julie A
23382691	10.1371/journal.pgen.1003225	Loci associated with N-glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G show pleiotropy with autoimmune diseases and haematological cancers.	Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247 individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of 1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P&lt;2.27 × 10(-9)) in the discovery analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation of a single plasma protein using GWAS. The results may also provide an explanation for the reported pleiotropy and antagonistic effects of loci involved in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.	2013	05	30	PLoS Genet	Lauc	Gordan
23512250	10.1093/jnci/djt042	Novel susceptibility variants at 10p12.31-12.2 for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in ethnically diverse populations.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and the incidence of ALL varies by ethnicity. Although accumulating evidence indicates inherited predisposition to ALL, the genetic basis of ALL susceptibility in diverse ancestry has not been comprehensively examined. We performed a multiethnic genome-wide association study in 1605 children with ALL and 6661 control subjects after adjusting for population structure, with validation in three replication series of 845 case subjects and 4316 control subjects. Association was tested by two-sided logistic regression. A novel ALL susceptibility locus at 10p12.31-12.2 (BMI1-PIP4K2A, rs7088318, P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) was identified in the genome-wide association study, with independent replication in European Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans (P = .001, .009, and .04, respectively). Association was also validated at four known ALL susceptibility loci: ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and CDKN2A/2B. Associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants were consistent across ethnicity, with multiple independent signals at IKZF1 and BMI1-PIP4K2A loci. The frequency of ARID5B and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants differed by ethnicity, in parallel with ethnic differences in ALL incidence. Suggestive evidence for modifying effects of age on genetic predisposition to ALL was also observed. ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants cumulatively conferred strong predisposition to ALL, with children carrying six to eight copies of risk alleles at a ninefold (95% confidence interval = 6.9 to 11.8) higher ALL risk relative to those carrying zero to one risk allele at these four single nucleotide polymorphisms. These findings indicate strong associations between inherited genetic variation and ALL susceptibility in children and shed new light on ALL molecular etiology in diverse ancestry.	2013	07	08	J Natl Cancer Inst	Xu	Heng
23608171	10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.028	Association of three polymorphisms in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a Chinese population.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focus on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2) and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly related to the risk of childhood ALL. These polymorphisms may lead to abnormal expression and dysfunction of the corresponding transcription factors and are likely to increase the risk of ALL. To validate the relationship between these SNPs and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL cases and 673 controls. We determined that the SNP rs10821936 in ARID5B was statistically significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL (P&lt;0.0001). The results were also significant for the subgroup analysis of high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk ALL as well as B-lineage ALL. Statistically significant differences were not found in the SNPs for IKZF1 and CEBPE. In conclusion, ARID5B rs10821936 could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese children.	2013	08	05	Gene	Wang	Yaping

Interactions between common germline variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 and other known childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk factors were queried using biospecimens and data from 770 ALL cases and 384 controls. Case-control comparisons revealed dose-dependent associations between ARID5B rs10821936, ARID5B rs10994982, and IKZF1 rs11978267 and childhood ALL overall, and B lineage and B lineage hyperdiploid ALL examined separately (all allelic odds ratios ≥1.33, Ptrend≤0.001). No heterogeneity was observed between ORs for males and females (all Pinteraction≥0.48). Likewise, no significant genotype-birth weight interactions were detected (all Pinteraction≥0.12) among cases. These results indicate similar ALL risk across strata of known risk factors. 	2013	09	17	Leuk Res	Linabery	Amy M
23836053	10.1007/s10552-013-0256-3	Genetic variants in ARID5B and CEBPE are childhood ALL susceptibility loci in Hispanics.	Recent genome-wide studies conducted in European Whites have identified novel susceptibility genes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to examine whether these loci are susceptibility genes among Hispanics, whose reported incidence of childhood ALL is the highest of all ethnic groups in California, and whether their effects differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). We genotyped 13 variants in these genes among 706 Hispanic (300 cases, 406 controls) and 594 NHW (225 cases, 369 controls) participants in a matched population-based case-control study in California. We found significant associations for the five studied ARID5B variants in both Hispanics (p values of 1.0 × 10(-9) to 0.004) and NHWs (p values of 2.2 × 10(-6) to 0.018). Risk estimates were in the same direction in both groups (ORs of 1.53-1.99 and 1.37-1.84, respectively) and strengthened when restricted to B-cell precursor high-hyperdiploid ALL (&gt;50 chromosomes; ORs of 2.21-3.22 and 1.67-2.71, respectively). Similar results were observed for the single CEBPE variant. Hispanics and NHWs exhibited different susceptibility loci at CDKN2A. Although IKZF1 loci showed significant susceptibility effects among NHWs (p &lt; 1 × 10(-5)), their effects among Hispanics were in the same direction but nonsignificant, despite similar minor allele frequencies. Future studies should examine whether the observed effects vary by environmental, immunological, or lifestyle factors.	2014	06	11	Cancer Causes Control	Chokkalingam	Anand P
23996088	10.1182/blood-2013-03-491316	Variation at 10p12.2 and 10p14 influences risk of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and phenotype.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer diagnosed in economically developed countries with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, accounting for approximately 70% of ALL. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided the first unambiguous evidence for common inherited susceptibility to BCP-ALL, identifying susceptibility loci at 7p12.2, 9p21.3, 10q21.2, and 14q11.2. To identify additional BCP-ALL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1658 cases and 4723 controls, with validation in 1449 cases and 1488 controls. Combined analysis identified novel loci mapping to 10p12.2 (rs10828317, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; P = 2.30 × 10(-9)) and 10p14 marked by rs3824662 (OR = 1.31; P = 8.62 × 10(-12)). The single nucleotide polymorphism rs10828317 is responsible for the N215S polymorphism in exon 7 of PIP4K2A, and rs3824662 localizes to intron 3 of the transcription factor and putative tumor suppressor gene GATA3. The rs10828317 association was shown to be specifically associated with hyperdiploid ALL, whereas the rs3824662-associated risk was confined to nonhyperdiploid non-TEL-AML1 + ALL. The risk allele of rs3824662 was correlated with older age at diagnosis (P &lt; .001) and significantly worse event-free survivorship (P &lt; .0001). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to BCP-ALL and the influence of constitutional genotype on disease development. 	2014	01	07	Blood	Migliorini	Gabriele
24013273	10.1007/s00432-013-1512-3	Intron 3 of the ARID5B gene: a hot spot for acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility.	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) have been associated with risk for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After reviewing previous studies, we realized that the most significant associations were restricted to intron 3, but the mechanism(s) by which those SNPs affect ALL risk remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the association between genetic variants of the intron 3 region of ARID5B and the incidence of B-ALL in a Spanish population. We also aimed to find a functional explanation for the association, searching for copy number variations (CNVs), and changes in ARID5B expression associated with the genotypes of the SNPs. We analyzed 10 SNPs in intron 3 of ARID5B in a Spanish population of 219 B-ALL patients and 397 unrelated controls with the Taqman Open Array platform. CNVs were analyzed in 23 patients and 17 controls using the Cytogenetics Whole-genome 2.7 M platform. Expression of ARID5B transcript 1 was quantified by qPCR and related to SNPs genotype in seven ALL cell lines. Association between intron 3 and B-ALL risk was confirmed for all of the SNPs evaluated in our Spanish population. We could not explain this association by the presence of CNVs. We neither detected changes in the expression of ARID5B isoform associated with the genotype of the SNPs. The intron 3 of ARID5B gene was found to be strongly associated with B-ALL risk in the Spanish population examined. However, neither CNVs nor changes in mRNA expression were found to be responsible for this association.	2013	12	16	J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	Gutiérrez-Camino	Ángela
22076464	10.1038/leu.2011.302	Identification of germline susceptibility loci in ETV6-RUNX1-rearranged childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease of the white blood cells. The etiology of ALL is believed to be multifactorial and likely to involve an interplay of environmental and genetic variables. We performed a genome-wide association study of 355 750 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 474 controls and 419 childhood ALL cases characterized by a t(12;21)(p13;q22) - the most common chromosomal translocation observed in childhood ALL - which leads to an ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The eight most strongly associated SNPs were followed-up in 951 ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases and 3061 controls from Germany/Austria and Italy, respectively. We identified a novel, genome-wide significant risk locus at 3q28 (TP63, rs17505102, P(CMH)=8.94 × 10(-9), OR=0.65). The separate analysis of the combined German/Austrian sample only, revealed additional genome-wide significant associations at 11q11 (OR8U8, rs1945213, P=9.14 × 10(-11), OR=0.69) and 8p21.3 (near INTS10, rs920590, P=6.12 × 10(-9), OR=1.36). These associations and another association at 11p11.2 (PTPRJ, rs3942852, P=4.95 × 10(-7), OR=0.72) remained significant in the German/Austrian replication panel after correction for multiple testing. Our findings demonstrate that germline genetic variation can specifically contribute to the risk of ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood ALL. The identification of TP63 and PTPRJ as susceptibility genes emphasize the role of the TP53 gene family and the importance of proteins regulating cellular processes in connection with tumorigenesis.	2012	07	05	Leukemia	Ellinghaus	E
22291082	10.1200/JCO.2011.38.0345	ARID5B genetic polymorphisms contribute to racial disparities in the incidence and treatment outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Recent genome-wide screens have identified genetic variations in ARID5B associated with susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to determine the contribution of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to racial disparities in ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome. We compared the association between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL susceptibility in whites (&gt; 95% European genetic ancestry; 978 cases and 1,046 controls) versus in Hispanics (&gt; 10% Native American ancestry; 330 cases and 541 controls). We determined the relationships between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL relapse risk in 1,605 children treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9904/9905 clinical trials. Among 49 ARID5B SNPs interrogated, 10 were significantly associated with ALL susceptibility in both whites and Hispanics (P &lt; .05), with risk alleles consistently more frequent in Hispanics than in whites. rs10821936 exhibited the most significant association in both races (P = 8.4 × 10(-20) in whites; P = 1 × 10(-6) in Hispanics), and genotype at this SNP was highly correlated with local Native American genetic ancestry (P = 1.8 × 10(-8)). Multivariate analyses in Hispanics identified an additional SNP associated with ALL susceptibility independent of rs10821936. Eight ARID5B SNPs were associated with both ALL susceptibility and relapse hazard; the alleles related to higher ALL incidence were always linked to poorer treatment outcome and were more frequent in Hispanics. ARID5B polymorphisms are important determinants of childhood ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome, and they contribute to racial disparities in this disease.	2012	06	08	J Clin Oncol	Xu	Heng

23021489	10.1186/1755-8794-5-42	Candidate gene association study in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia evaluated by Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance.	We carried out a candidate gene association study in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to identify possible genetic risk factors in a Hungarian population. The results were evaluated with traditional statistical methods and with our newly developed Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA) method. We collected genomic DNA and clinical data from 543 children, who underwent chemotherapy due to ALL, and 529 healthy controls. Altogether 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 candidate genes were genotyped. With logistic regression, we identified 6 SNPs in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes associated with increased risk to B-cell ALL, and two SNPs in the STAT3 gene, which decreased the risk to hyperdiploid ALL. Because the associated SNPs were in linkage in each gene, these associations corresponded to one signal per gene. The odds ratio (OR) associated with the tag SNPs were: OR = 1.69, P = 2.22x10(-7) for rs4132601 (IKZF1), OR = 1.53, P = 1.95x10(-5) for rs10821936 (ARID5B) and OR = 0.64, P = 2.32x10(-4) for rs12949918 (STAT3). With the BN-BMLA we confirmed the findings of the frequentist-based method and received additional information about the nature of the relations between the SNPs and the disease. E.g. the rs10821936 in ARID5B and rs17405722 in STAT3 showed a weak interaction, and in case of T-cell lineage sample group, the gender showed a weak interaction with three SNPs in three genes. In the hyperdiploid patient group the BN-BMLA detected a strong interaction among SNPs in the NOTCH1, STAT1, STAT3 and BCL2 genes. Evaluating the survival rate of the patients with ALL, the BN-BMLA showed that besides risk groups and subtypes, genetic variations in the BAX and CEBPA genes might also influence the probability of survival of the patients. In the present study we confirmed the roles of genetic variations in ARID5B and IKZF1 in the susceptibility to B-cell ALL. With the newly developed BN-BMLA method several gene-gene, gene-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype connections were revealed. We showed several advantageous features of the new method, and suggested that in gene association studies the BN-BMLA might be a useful supplementary to the traditional frequentist-based statistical method.	2013	03	05	BMC Med Genomics	Lautner-Csorba	Orsolya
23114164		[Research advances on correlation of ARID5B gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia - review].	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer. Although its etiology remains poorly understood, the hypothesis of ALL correlated with a genetic basis was examined through association studies based on candidate genes. Recently, two independent large-scale genome-wide association studies reported that the five single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7073837; rs10821936; rs10994982; rs7089424; rs10740055) in the gene AT rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) at 10q21.2, were associated with the high incidence risk of C-ALL, especially with hyperdiploid lymphoblastic leukemia. Variations in these single nucleotide polymorphisms influence the risk of specific disease subtypes, and also possess race- and sex-differences in leukemia incidence. Further elucidation of the mechanisms through which ARID5B variants are involved in C-ALL not only has a great diagnostic value, but also a guidance for the clinical therapy, ultimately improving the prognosis of disease. Therefore, the related studies of ARID5B with C-ALL were summarized briefly in this review.	2013	12	05	Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Qian	Xi-Feng

Recent studies have shown that SNPs mapping to 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 9p21 (CDKN2A), 10q21.2 (ARID5B), and 14q11.2 (CEBPE) and carrier status for recessively inherited Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS) influence childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk. To examine these relationship, we analysed 398 ALL cases and 731 controls from Poland. Statistically significant association between genotype at 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 10q21.2 (ARID5B) and the NBS associated locus, 8q21.3 (NBN) and ALL risk was found; odds ratios (ORs), 1.34 (P=0.002), 1.33 (P=0.003), and 1325.21 (P=0.0028), respectively. These data provide further insights into the biological basis of ALL highlighting the existence of both common and rare disease susceptibility variants.	2011	12	14	Leuk Res	Pastorczak	Agata

Recent genome-wide association data have implicated genetic variation at 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 10q21.2 (ARIDB5), and 14q11.2 (CEBPE) in the etiology of B-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To verify and further examine the relationship between these variants and ALL risk, we genotyped 1384 cases of precursor B-cell childhood ALL and 1877 controls from Germany and the United Kingdom. The combined data provided statistically significant support for an association between genotype at each of these loci and ALL risk; odds ratios (OR), 1.69 (P = 7.51 x10(-22)), 1.80 (P = 5.90 x 10(-28)), and 1.27 (P = 4.90 x 10(-6)), respectively. Furthermore, the risk of ALL increases with an increasing numbers of variant alleles for the 3 loci (OR(per-allele) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.62; P(trend) = 3.49 x 10(-42)), consistent with a polygenic model of disease susceptibility. These data provide unambiguous evidence for the role of these variants in defining ALL risk underscoring approximately 64% of cases.	2010	04	02	Blood	Prasad	Rashmi B

20189245	10.1016/j.leukres.2010.02.001	Genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Korea.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a case-control study conducted in Korea. Incident childhood ALL cases (n=50) and non-cancer controls (n=50) frequency-matched to cases by age and sex, recruited from three teaching hospitals in Seoul between 2003 and 2008, were genotyped using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 platform. ALL risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age and birth weight. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for adjusting multiple tests. Of these 1 million SNPs, six SNPs in 4 genes (HAO1 rs6140264, EPB41L2 rs9388856, rs9388857, rs1360756, C2orf3 12105972, MAN2A1 rs3776932) were strongly associated with childhood ALL risk (P(dominant)&lt;or=0.0001 and P(trend)&lt;0.006). These SNPs remained significant after FDR adjustment (FDR value &lt;0.2). Our genome-wide association study in Korea children identified a few genetic variations as potential susceptibility markers for ALL, warranting further replication studies among various ethnic groups.	2010	09	30	Leuk Res	Han	Sohee

Although childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer, its etiology remains poorly understood. In an attempt to replicate the findings of 2 recent genome-wide association studies in a French-Canadian cohort, we confirmed the association of 5 SNPs [rs7073837 (P=4.2 x 10(-4)), rs10994982 (P=3.8 x 10(-4)), rs10740055 (P=1.6 x 10(-5)), rs10821936 (P=1.7 x 10(-7)) and rs7089424 (P=3.6 x 10(-7))] in the ARID5B gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We also confirmed a selective effect for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with hyperdiploidy and report a putative gender-specific effect of ARID5B SNPs on acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk in males. This study provides a strong rationale for more detailed analysis to identify the causal variants at this locus and to better understand the overall functional contribution of ARID5B to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility.	2012	11	08	Haematologica	Healy	Jasmine

High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common malignancies in children. It is characterized by gain of chromosomes, typically +X, +4, +6, +10, +14, +17, +18, and +21,+21; little is known about additional genetic aberrations. Approximately 20% of the patients relapse; therefore it is clinically important to identify risk-stratifying markers. We used SNP array analysis to investigate a consecutive series of 74 cases of high hyperdiploid ALL. We show that the characteristic chromosomal gains are even more frequent than previously believed, indicating that karyotyping mistakes are common, and that almost 80% of the cases display additional abnormalities detectable by SNP array analysis. Subclonality analysis strongly implied that the numerical aberrations were primary and arose before structural events, suggesting that step-wise evolution of the leukemic clone is common. An association between duplication of 1q and +5 was seen (P = 0.003). Other frequent abnormalities included whole-chromosome uniparental isodisomies (wUPIDs) 9 and 11, gain of 17q not associated with isochromosome formation, extra gain of part of 21q, deletions of ETS variant 6 (ETV6), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CKDN2A) and paired box 5 (PAX5), and PAN3 poly(A) specific ribonuclease subunit homolog (PAN3) microdeletions. Comparison of whole-chromosome and partial UPID9 suggested different pathogenetic outcomes, with the former not involving CDKN2A. Finally, two cases had partial deletions of AT rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B), indicating that acquired as well as constitutional variants in this locus may be associated with pediatric ALL. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of the genetic landscape of high hyperdiploid childhood ALL, including the heterogeneous pattern of secondary genetic events.	2011	05	12	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Paulsson	Kajsa
19684603	10.1038/ng.432	Germline genomic variants associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Using the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and publicly available genotypes, we identified 18 SNPs whose allele frequency differed significantly(P &lt; 1 x 10(-5)) between pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (n = 317) and non-ALL controls (n = 17,958). Two SNPs in ARID5B not only differed between ALL and non-ALL groups (rs10821936, P = 1.4 x 10(-15), odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; rs10994982, P = 5.7 x 10(-9), OR = 1.62) but also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes (rs10821936, P = 1.62 x 10(-5), OR = 2.17; rs10994982, P = 0.003, OR 1.72). These ARID5B SNPs also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes in an independent validation cohort (n = 124 children with ALL; P = 0.003 and P = 0.0008, OR 2.45 and 2.86, respectively) and were associated with methotrexate accumulation and gene expression pattern in leukemic lymphoblasts. We conclude that germline variants affect susceptibility to, and characteristics of, specific ALL subtypes.	2009	09	28	Nat Genet	Treviño	Lisa R
19684604	10.1038/ng.430	Loci on 7p12.2, 10q21.2 and 14q11.2 are associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	To identify risk variants for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we conducted a genome-wide association study of two case-control series, analyzing the genotypes with respect to 291,423 tagging SNPs in a total of 907 ALL cases and 2,398 controls. We identified risk loci for ALL at 7p12.2 (IKZF1, rs4132601, odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 1.20 x 10(-19)), 10q21.2 (ARID5B, rs7089424, OR = 1.65, P = 6.69 x 10(-19)) and 14q11.2 (CEBPE, rs2239633, OR = 1.34, P = 2.88 x 10(-7)). The 10q21.2 (ARID5B) risk association appears to be selective for the subset of B-cell precursor ALL with hyperdiploidy. These data show that common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing childhood ALL and provide new insight into disease causation of this specific hematological cancer. Notably, all three risk variants map to genes involved in transcriptional regulation and differentiation of B-cell progenitors.	2009	09	28	Nat Genet	Papaemmanuil	Elli

35482846	10.1080/15548627.2022.2071382	Mutations in V-ATPase in follicular lymphoma activate autophagic flux creating a targetable dependency.	The recent discovery of recurrent gene mutations in chaperones or components of the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) in follicular lymphoma (FL) was an unexpected finding. The application of whole exome sequencing and targeted gene re-sequencing has resulted in the identification of mutations in <i>ATP6AP1, ATP6V1B2</i> and <i>VMA21</i> in a combined 30% of FL, together constituting a major novel mutated pathway in this disease. Interestingly, no other human hematological malignancy carries these mutations at more than sporadic occurrences, implicating unique aspects of FL biology requiring these mutations. The mutations in ATP6V1B2 and VMA21 through separate mechanisms impair lysosomal V-ATPase activity resulting in an elevated lysosomal pH. The elevated lysosomal pH impairs protein and peptide hydrolysis and associates with reduced cytoplasmic amino acid concentrations resulting in compensatory activation of autophagic flux. The elevated autophagic flux constitutes a survival dependency for FL cells and can be targeted with inhibitors to ULK1 and multiple recently identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Targeting autophagy alone or in combination with other targeted therapies constitutes a novel therapeutic opportunity for FL patients.	2022	05	31	Autophagy	Wang	Fangyang
26691987	10.1038/ng.3473	Recurrent mTORC1-activating RRAGC mutations in follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma is an incurable B cell malignancy characterized by the t(14;18) translocation and mutations affecting the epigenome. Although frequent gene mutations in key signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NOTCH and NF-κB, have also been defined, the spectrum of these mutations typically overlaps with that in the closely related diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Using a combination of discovery exome and extended targeted sequencing, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in RRAGC uniquely enriched in patients with follicular lymphoma (17%). More than half of the mutations preferentially co-occurred with mutations in ATP6V1B2 and ATP6AP1, which encode components of the vacuolar H(+)-ATP ATPase (V-ATPase) known to be necessary for amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. The RagC variants increased raptor binding while rendering mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. The activating nature of the RRAGC mutations, their existence in the dominant clone and their stability during disease progression support their potential as an excellent candidate for therapeutic targeting. 	2016	06	03	Nat Genet	Okosun	Jessica
25713363	10.1073/pnas.1501199112	Mutations in early follicular lymphoma progenitors are associated with suppressed antigen presentation.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is incurable with conventional therapies and has a clinical course typified by multiple relapses after therapy. These tumors are genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96% of FL tumors and two or more in 76% of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased antigen presentation. 	2015	05	11	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Green	Michael R
30720463	10.1172/JCI98288	Follicular lymphoma-associated mutations in vacuolar ATPase ATP6V1B2 activate autophagic flux and mTOR.	The discovery of recurrent mutations in subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase (v-ATPase) in follicular lymphoma (FL) highlights a role for the amino acid- and energy-sensing pathway to mTOR in the pathogenesis of this disease. Here, through the use of complementary experimental approaches involving mammalian cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have demonstrated that mutations in the human v-ATPase subunit ATP6V1B2 (also known as Vma2 in yeast) activate autophagic flux and maintain mTOR/TOR in an active state. Engineered lymphoma cell lines and primary FL B cells carrying mutated ATP6V1B2 demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive low leucine concentrations. The treatment of primary FL B cells with inhibitors of autophagy uncovered an addiction for survival for FL B cells harboring ATP6V1B2 mutations. These data support the idea of mutational activation of autophagic flux by recurrent hotspot mutations in ATP6V1B2 as an adaptive mechanism in FL pathogenesis and as a possible new therapeutically targetable pathway.	2020	06	15	J Clin Invest	Wang	Fangyang
34614146	10.1182/blood.2020010263	Validation of POD24 as a robust early clinical end point of poor survival in FL from 5225 patients on 13 clinical trials.	Observational studies and stand-alone trials indicate that patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who experience disease progression within 24 months of front-line chemoimmunotherapy (POD24), have poor outcomes. We performed a pooled analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials of patients with FL in the pre- and postrituximab eras to identify clinical factors that predict POD24. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between clinical factors and POD24. Cox regression evaluated the association between POD24 as a time-dependent factor and subsequent overall survival (OS). A landmark analysis evaluated the association of POD24 with OS for the subset of patients who were alive at 24 months after trial registration. Patients without progression at 24 months at baseline had favorable performance status (PS), limited-stage (I/II) disease, low-risk FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, normal baseline hemoglobin, and normal baseline β2 microglobulin (B2M) level. In a multivariable logistic regression model, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.30), PS ≥2 (OR, 1.63), B2M (≥3 mg/L; OR, 1.43), and high-risk FLIPI score (3-5; OR, 3.14) were associated with increased risk of progression before 24 months. In the time-dependent Cox model and the 24-month landmark analysis, POD24 was associated with poor subsequent OS (hazard ratio, 4.85 and 3.06, respectively). This is the largest pooled analysis of clinical trials data validating POD24 as a robust indicator of poor FL survival and identified clinical predictors of early death and progression that can aid in building comprehensive prognostic models incorporating clinical and molecular predictors of POD24.	2022	04	14	Blood	Casulo	Carla
34664256	10.1111/bjh.17894	Tracking the evolution of untreated high-intermediate/high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by circulating tumour DNA.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogenous malignancy, early identification of patients for relapse remains challenging. The potential to non-invasively monitor tumour evolutionary dynamics of DLBCL needs to be further established. In the present study, 17 tumour biopsy and 38 plasma samples from 38 patients with high-intermediate/high-risk DLBCL were evaluated at baseline. Longitudinal blood samples were also collected during therapy. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) was analysed using targeted sequencing based on a gene panel via a recently developed methodology, circulating single-molecule amplification and re-sequencing technology (cSMART). We found that the most frequently mutated genes were tumour protein p53 (TP53; 42·1%), histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D; 28·9%), caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11; 21·1%), cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein (CREBBP; 15·8%), β<sub>2</sub> -microglobulin (B2M; 15·8%), and tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3; 15·8%). The mutation profiles between ctDNA and matched tumour tissue showed good concordance; however, more mutation sites were detected in ctDNA samples. Either TP53 or B2M mutations before treatment predicted poor prognosis. Analysis of dynamic blood samples confirmed the utility of ctDNA for the real-time assessment of treatment response and revealed that the increases in ctDNA levels and changes in KMT2D mutation status could be useful predictors of disease progression. Our present results suggest that ctDNA is a promising method for the detection of mutation spectrum and serves as a biomarker for disease monitoring and predicting clinical recurrence.	2022	02	14	Br J Haematol	Zhang	Sicong
35075971	10.1080/10428194.2021.2010060	Circulating tumor DNA in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma: a retrospective study.	Few data exist concerning circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) relevance in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). To explore this topic, we applied a 9-gene next-generation sequencing pipeline to samples from forty-four PMBL patients (median age 36.5 years). The primary endpoint was a similarity between paired biopsy/plasma mutational profiles. We detected at least one variant in 32 plasma samples (80%). The similarity between the biopsy and ctDNA genetic profiles for the 30 patients with paired mutated biopsy/plasma samples was greater than or equal to 80% in 19 patients (63.3%). We then compared PMBL ctDNA features with those of a cohort of Hodgkin lymphoma patients (<i>n</i> = 60). The top three mutated genes were <i>SOCS1, TNFAIP3, and B2M</i> in both lymphoma types. PMBL displayed more alterations in <i>TNFAIP3</i> (71.9% vs. 46.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.029) and <i>GNA13</i> (46.9% vs. 17.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.013) than cHL. Our 9-gene set may delineate tumor genotypes using ctDNA samples from both lymphoma types.	2022	04	20	Leuk Lymphoma	Camus	Vincent
35368100	10.1002/hon.2994	A novel clinical immune-related prognostic model predicts the overall survival of mantle cell lymphoma.	The mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) International Prognostic Index (MIPI) and combined MIPI (MIPI-c) are commonly used for risk classification of MCL patients. However, these indexes lack immune-related parameters. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel prognostic model that integrated clinical and immune parameters. A total of 189 patients with newly diagnosed MCL from January 2010 to June 2020 were enrolled in our study. A nomogram and immune-related prognostic index (IRPI) were established to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients according to univariate and multivariate analyses. Discrimination and calibration were used to compare the prognostic performance of the IRPI, MIPI, and MIPI-c. External validation was performed based on validation dataset (n = 150) from two other centers. The results for the training dataset indicated that B symptoms, platelet count, B2M level, CD4+ T-cell count&lt;26.7% and CD8+ T-cell count&gt;44.2% were predictors for OS. All the prognostic factors were integrated into the nomogram. For the overlap of confidence intervals of each variable, we assigned one point for each factor. The IRPI categorized patients into three risk categories: a score of zero indicated low risk, a score of one or two indicated intermediate risk, and a score of ≥3 indicated high risk. The IRPI showed better discrimination and calibration power than the MIPI and MIPI-c in the training dataset and validation dataset. The novel IRPI is a refined risk stratification index and reflects the strong complementary prognostic effects between clinical and immune parameters in MCL.	2022	08	09	Hematol Oncol	Lv	Huijuan
35611992	10.1002/gcc.23069	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is characterized by large-scale copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity.	Development of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is driven by cumulative genomic aberrations. We discovered a unique copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) landscape of PMBL which distinguishes this tumor from other B-cell malignancies, including the biologically related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Using single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis we identified large-scale CN-LOH lesions in 91% (30/33) of diagnostic PMBLs and both investigated PMBL-derived cell lines. Altogether, the cohort showed 157 extra-large (25.3-248.4 Mb) CN-LOH lesions affecting up to 14 chromosomes per case (mean of 4.4) and resulting in a reduction of heterozygosity an average of 9.9% (range 1.3-51%) of the genome. Predominant involvement of terminal chromosomal segments suggests the implication of B-cell specific crossover events in the pathogenesis of PMBL. Notably, CN-LOH stretches non-randomly clustered on 6p (60%), 15 (37.2%), and 17q (40%), and frequently co-occurred with homozygous mutations in the MHC I (6p21), B2M (15q15), and GNA13 (17q23) genes, respectively, as shown by preliminary whole-exome/genome sequencing data. Altogether, our findings implicate CN-LOH as a novel and distinct mutational process contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of PMBL. The aberration acting as ""second hit"" in the Knudson hypothesis, ranks as the major mechanism converting to homozygosity the PMBL-related driver genes. Screening of the cohort of 199 B cell leukemia/lymphoma whole-genomes revealed significant differences in the CN-LOH landscape of PMBL and other B-cell malignancies, including the biologically related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	2022	08	05	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	Tuveri	Stefania
35795062	10.3389/fonc.2022.870487	Plasma Concentrations and Cancer-Associated Mutations in Cell-Free Circulating DNA of Treatment-Naive Follicular Lymphoma for Improved Non-Invasive Diagnosis and Prognosis.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for 10-20% of all lymphomas in western countries. As a clinically heterogeneous cancer, FL occasionally undergoes histological transformation to more aggressive B cell lymphoma types that are associated with poor prognosis. Here we evaluated the potential of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of follicular lymphoma patients. Twenty well-characterized FL cases (13 symptomatic and 7 asymptomatic) were prospectively included in this study. Plasma cfDNA, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue DNA, and patient-matched granulocyte genomic DNA samples were obtained from 20 treatment-naive FL cases. Ultra-deep targeted next-generation sequencing was performed with these DNA samples by using a custom-designed platform including exons and exon-intron boundaries of 110 FL related genes. Using a strict computational bioinformatics pipeline, we identified 91 somatic variants in 31 genes in treatment-naive FL cases. Selected variants were cross-validated by using PCR-Sanger sequencing. We observed higher concentrations of cfDNA and a higher overlap of somatic variants present both in cfDNA and tumor tissue DNA in symptomatic FL cases compared to asymptomatic ones. Variants known to be associated with FL pathogenesis such as STAT6 p.D419 or EZH2 p.Y646 were observed in patient-matched cfDNA and tumor tissue samples. Consistent with previous observations, high Ki-67 staining, elevated LDH levels, FDG PET/CT positivity were associated with poor survival. High plasma cfDNA concentrations or the presence of <i>BCL2</i> mutations in cfDNA showed significant association with poor survival in treatment-naive patients. <i>BCL2</i> mutation evaluations in cfDNA improved the prognostic utility of previously established variables. In addition, we observed that a FL patient who had progressive disease contained histological transformation-associated gene (i.e. <i>B2M</i> and <i>BTG1</i>) mutations only in cfDNA. Pre-treatment concentrations and genotype of plasma cfDNA may be used as a liquid biopsy to improve diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of histological transformation. Targeted therapies related to oncogenic mutations may be applied based on cfDNA genotyping results. However, the results of this study need to be validated in a larger cohort of FL patients as the analyses conducted in this study have an exploratory nature.	2022	07	16	Front Oncol	Hatipoğlu	Tevfik
35885481	10.3390/diagnostics12071575	Cell-Free DNA for Genomic Analysis in Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	High-throughput sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as a promising noninvasive approach in lymphomas, being particularly useful when a biopsy specimen is not available for molecular analysis, as it frequently occurs in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). We used cfDNA for genomic characterization in 20 PMBL patients by means of a custom NGS panel for gene mutations and low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for copy number analysis (CNA) in a real-life setting. Appropriate cfDNA to perform the analyses was obtained in 18/20 cases. The sensitivity of cfDNA to detect the mutations present in paired FFPE samples was 69% (95% CI: 60-78%). The mutational landscape found in cfDNA samples was highly consistent with that of the tissue, with the most frequently mutated genes being <i>B2M</i> (61%), <i>SOCS1</i> (61%), <i>GNA13</i> (44%), <i>STAT6</i> (44%), <i>NFKBIA</i> (39%), <i>ITPKB</i> (33%), and <i>NFKBIE</i> (33%). Overall, we observed a 75% concordance to detect CNA gains/losses between DNA microarray and low-pass WGS. The sensitivity of low-pass WGS was remarkably higher for clonal CNA (18/20, 90%) compared to subclonal alterations identified by DNA microarray. No significant associations between cfDNA amount and tumor burden or outcome were found. cfDNA is an excellent alternative source for the accurate genetic characterization of PMBL cases.	2022	07	31	Diagnostics (Basel)	Rivas-Delgado	Alfredo
36055572	10.1016/j.clim.2022.109105	A novel immune-related epigenetic signature based on the transcriptome for predicting the prognosis and therapeutic response of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Epigenetic modifications contribute to lymphomagenesis. Here, we performed an expression clustering analysis and identified two epigenetic-related clusters (EC1 and EC2). EC1 presented abundant TP53, MYD88, HIST1H1D, HIST1H1C, KMT2D and EZH2 mutations and an inferior prognosis. Pathways involved in the regulation of DNA methylation/demethylation, histone methyltransferase activity, and protein methyltransferase activity were significantly enriched in EC1. However, EC2 was frequently accompanied by B2M, CD70 and MEF2B mutations, which presented with enrichments in DNA damage repair, cytokine-mediated and B-cell activated immune signaling, increased levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-, γδT- and T helper-cells, as well as immune scores and immunogenic cell death (ICD) modulators. According to the prediction, EC1 was more sensitive to vorinostat, serdemetan and navitoclax. However, ruxolitinib, cytarabine and CP466722 were more suitable treatments for EC2. The novel immune-related epigenetic signature exhibits promising clinical predictive value for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), particularly for guiding epigenetic therapeutic regimens. R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) based combination treatment regimens are suggested.	2022	09	10	Clin Immunol	Wang	Xiaoxuan
32079702	10.3324/haematol.2019.237719	Targeted genotyping of circulating tumor DNA for classical Hodgkin lymphoma monitoring: a prospective study.	The relevance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis as a liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease tool in the management of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) patients was demonstrated in retrospective settings and remains to be confirmed in a prospective setting. We developed a targeted Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) panel for fast analysis (AmpliSeq technology) of nine commonly mutated genes in biopies and ctDNA of cHL patients. We then conducted a prospective trial to assess ctDNA follow up at diagnosis and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy (C2). Sixty cHL patients treated by first line conventional chemotherapy (BEACOPPescalated [21.3%], ABVD/ABVD-like [73.5%] and other regimens [5.2%, for elderly patients] were assessed in this non-interventional study. Median age of the patients was 33.5 years (range 20-86). Variants were identified in 42 (70%) patients. Mutations of NFKBIE, TNFAIP3, STAT6, PTPN1, B2M, XPO1, ITPKB, GNA13 and SOCS1 were found in 13.3%, 31.7%, 23.3%, 5%, 33.3%, 10%, 23.3%, 13.3% and 50% of patients, respectively. ctDNA concentration and genotype are correlated with clinical characteristics and presentation. Regarding early therapeutic response, 45 patients (83%, NA=6) had a negative positron emission tomography (PET) after C2 (Deauville Score 1-3). Mean of DeltaSUVmax after C2 was -78.8%. We analyzed ctDNA after C2 for 54 patients (90%). ctDNA became rapidly undetectable in all cases after C2. Variant detection in ctDNA is suitable to depict the genetic features of cHL at diagnosis and may help to assess early treatment response, in association with PET.

32961552	10.1182/blood.2020007507	Mutational landscape of gray zone lymphoma.	The mutational landscape of gray zone lymphoma (GZL) has not yet been established, and differences from related entities are largely unknown. Here, we studied coding sequence mutations of 50 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative GZLs and 20 polymorphic EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (poly-EBV-L) in comparison with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and DLBCL. Exomes of 21 GZL and 7 poly-EBV-L cases, along with paired constitutional DNA, were analyzed as a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 217 genes in an extension cohort of 29 GZL and 13 poly-EBV-L cases. GZL cases with thymic niche involvement (anterior mediastinal mass) exhibited a mutation profile closely resembling cHL and PMBCL, with SOCS1 (45%), B2M (45%), TNFAIP3 (35%), GNA13 (35%), LRRN3 (32%), and NFKBIA (29%) being the most recurrently mutated genes. In contrast, GZL cases without thymic niche involvement (n = 18) had a significantly distinct pattern that was enriched in mutations related to apoptosis defects (TP53 [39%], BCL2 [28%], BIRC6 [22%]) and depleted in GNA13, XPO1, or NF-κB signaling pathway mutations (TNFAIP3, NFKBIE, IKBKB, NFKBIA). They also exhibited more BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements compared with thymic GZL. Poly-EBV-L cases presented a distinct mutational profile, including STAT3 mutations and a significantly lower coding mutation load in comparison with EBV- GZL. Our study highlights characteristic mutational patterns in GZL associated with presentation in the thymic niche, suggesting a common cell of origin and disease evolution overlapping with related anterior mediastinal lymphomas.	2021	09	27	Blood	Sarkozy	Clémentine
32964767	10.1080/10428194.2020.1821011	Frequent mutations in HLA and related genes in extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas.	Extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas (ENKTCLs) are aggressive Epstein-Barr virus-associated T/NK neoplasms that predominantly affect Asians. To explore the causative somatic events, we conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of 19 ENKTCL patients by whole-genome (<i>N</i> = 2), whole-exome (<i>N</i> = 16), and targeted sequencing (<i>N</i> = 15). Commonly deregulated gene pathways in ENKTCLs included epigenetic modifiers (58%, 11/19) followed by human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and related genes including <i>HLA-A</i>, <i>B2M, TAP1, CD274</i>, and <i>PDCD1LG2</i> (32%, 6/19), and JAK-STAT pathway (26%, 5/19). Conspicuously, loss-of-function mutations in <i>HLA-A</i> were recurrently identified in ENKTCLs (16%, 3/19). HLA protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 16 patients and lower expression was associated with advanced stages at presentation (<i>p</i> = .007). In conclusion, the defective antigen presenting pathway is common and related to disease progression, suggesting immune escape as a pathogenic mechanism of ENKTCLs.	2021	04	27	Leuk Lymphoma	Polprasert	Chantana
33311649	10.1038/s41379-020-00720-7	Targeted massively parallel sequencing of mature lymphoid neoplasms: assessment of empirical application and diagnostic utility in routine clinical practice.	Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has become a viable diagnostic tool to interrogate genetic profiles of numerous tumors but has yet to be routinely adopted in the setting of lymphoma. Here, we report the empirical application of a targeted 40-gene panel developed for use in mature lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) and report our experience on over 500 cases submitted for MPS during the first year of its clinical use. MPS was applied to both fresh and fixed specimens. The most frequent diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (116), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (60), marginal zone lymphoma (52), and follicular lymphoma (43), followed by a spectrum of mature T-cell neoplasms (40). Of 534 cases submitted, 471 generated reportable results in MLNs, with disease-associated variants (DAVs) detected in 241 cases (51.2%). The most frequent DAVs affected TP53 (30%), CREBBP (14%), MYD88 (14%), TNFRSF14 (10%), TNFAIP3 (10%), B2M (7%), and NOTCH2 (7%). The bulk of our findings confirm what is reported in the scientific literature. While a substantial majority of mutations did not directly impact diagnosis, MPS results were utilized to either change, refine, or facilitate the final diagnosis in ~10.8% of cases with DAVs and 5.5% of cases overall. In addition, we identified preanalytic variables that significantly affect assay performance highlighting items for specimen triage. We demonstrate the technical viability and utility of the judicious use of a targeted MPS panel that may help to establish general guidelines for specimen selection and diagnostic application in MLNs in routine clinical practice.	2021	12	14	Mod Pathol	Davis	Adam R
33332932	10.4143/crt.2020.1060	Prognostic Stratification of Patients with Burkitt Lymphoma Using Serum β2-microglobulin Levels.	We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serum β2-microglobulin for patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and to propose a risk-stratifying classification system. A prospective registry-based cohort study of BL patients treated with dose-intensive or effective dose-adjusted chemotherapies (n=81) was conducted. Survival outcomes were compared based on previously reported risk groups and/or serum β2-microglobulin levels. A risk-stratifying classification system incorporating serum β2-microglobulin levels was proposed and validated in an independent validation cohort (n=60). The median age was 47 years, and 57 patients (70.4%) were male. Patients with high serum β2-microglobulin levels (&gt; 2 mg/L) had significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (p &lt; 0.01 for both). Serum β2-microglobulin levels further stratified patients in the low-risk and high-risk groups in terms of PFS (p=0.010 and p=0.044, respectively) and OS (p=0.014 and p=0.026, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed that a high serum β2-microglobulin level (&gt; 2 mg/L) was independently associated with a shorter PFS (hazards ratio [HR], 3.56; p=0.047) and OS (HR, 4.66; p=0.043). The new classification system incorporating the serum β2-microglobulin level allowed the stratification of patients into three distinct risk subgroups with 5-year OS rates of 100%, 89.5%, and 62.5%. In an independent cohort of BL, the system was validated by stratifying patients with different survival outcomes. Serum β2-microglobulin level is an independent prognostic factor for BL patients. The proposed β2-microglobulin-based classification system could stratify patients with distinct survival outcomes, which may help define appropriate treatment approaches for individual patients.	2021	12	17	Cancer Res Treat	Kim	Hyung-Don
33567641	10.3390/cancers13040682	Genomic Landscape of Hodgkin Lymphoma.	Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is predominantly composed of reactive, non-neoplastic cells surrounding scarcely distributed tumor cells, that is, so-called Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) or lymphocyte predominant (LP) cells. This scarcity impeded the analysis of the tumor cell genomes for a long time, but recently developed methods (especially laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry/fluorescence-activated cell sorting) facilitated molecular investigation, elucidating the pathophysiological principles of ""Hodgkin lymphomagenesis"". We reviewed the relevant literature of the last three decades focusing on the genomic landscape of classic and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL) and summarized molecular cornerstones. Firstly, the malignant cells of HL evade the immune system by altered expression of <i>PDL1/2</i>, <i>B2M</i> and MHC class I and II due to various genetic alterations. Secondly, tumor growth is promoted by permanently activated JAK/STAT signaling due to pervasive mutations of multiple genes involved in the pathway. Thirdly, apoptosis of neoplastic cells is prevented by alterations of NF-κB compounds and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. Additionally, Epstein-Barr virus infection can simultaneously activate JAK/STAT and NF-κB, similarly leading to enhanced survival and evasion of apoptosis. Finally, epigenetic phenomena such as promoter hypermethylation lead to the downregulation of B-lineage-specific, tumor-suppressor and immune regulation genes. The blueprint of HL genomics has been laid, paving the way for future investigations into its complex pathophysiology.	2021	03	03	Cancers (Basel)	Brune	Magdalena M
33569430	10.21037/atm-20-7574	Molecular profiling of Chinese systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients: novel evidence of genetic heterogeneity.	Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of ALCL may help to improve the clinical management of patients with ALCL. However, due to the rarity of the disease, the genetic heterogeneity of ALCL has not been well elucidated. This study aimed to comprehensively elucidate the mutational landscape of tumor tissue samples from patients with systemic ALCL. Thirty-six patients with systemic ALCL were enrolled in this retrospective study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tumor tissues at baseline to identify anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>) fusions. Capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a panel spanning 112 lymphoma-related genes, including <i>ALK</i> rearrangements, was also performed on tumor tissue samples. A total of 102 mutations were identified in the entire cohort. Among the 36 patients included in this analysis, 14 (38.8%) were <i>ALK</i> positive, as determined by IHC, while NGS showed 12 patients (33.3%) to harbor <i>ALK</i> rearrangements. Younger patients were more likely to have <i>ALK</i>-positive ALCL (P=0.011). Patients with wild-type (WT) <i>ALK</i> were more likely to have single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions or deletions (INDELs) than patients with <i>ALK</i> rearrangements (P=0.027). Among the 22 patients with WT <i>ALK</i>, the most commonly mutated genes were <i>TP53</i> (n=6, 27.3%), followed by <i>NOTCH1</i> (n=5, 22.7%), <i>KMT2D</i> (n=3, 13.6%), <i>KRAS</i> (n=3, 13.6%), <i>TET2</i> (n=3, 13.6%), and <i>JAK1</i> (n=2, 9.1%). Mutations in <i>PRDM1</i>, a commonly mutated gene in <i>ALK</i>-negative patients, were not detected in our <i>ALK</i>-negative cohort. Start-loss of beta-2-microglobulin (<i>B2M</i>) was detected in another patient; this patient had a favorable prognosis, with an overall survival exceeding 19 months. Our study revealed the unique genomic profiles of Chinese ALCL patients and represents an incremental step in deepening the understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of ALCL patients.	2022	04	20	Ann Transl Med	Zhong	Li-Hua
33747936	10.3389/fonc.2021.622648	Genomic Mutation Profile of Primary Gastrointestinal Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Primary gastrointestinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GI-DLBCL) is the most common gastrointestinal lymphoma, but its genetic features are poorly understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 25 primary tumor samples from patients with GI-DLBCL and 23 matched normal tissue samples. Oncogenic mutations were screened, and the correlations between genetic mutations and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Twenty-five patients with GI-DLBCL were enrolled in the genetic mutation analysis with a median of 184 (range 79-382) protein-altering variants per patient. We identified recurrent oncogenic mutations in GI-DLBCL, including those in <i>TP53, MUC16, B2M, CCND3, HIST1H1C, NEB</i>, and <i>ID3</i>. Compared with nodal DLBCL, GI-DLBCL exhibited an increased mutation frequency of <i>TP53</i> and reduced mutation frequencies of <i>PIM1, CREBBP, BCL2, KMT2D</i>, and <i>EZH2</i>. Moreover, GI-DLBCL exhibited fewer <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CD79B</i> mutations than DLBCL in the testis and central nervous system. GI-DLBCLs with <i>HLA-B, MEF2A, RHOA</i>, and <i>NAV3</i> mutations exhibited a tendency toward a high proliferation index. <i>MUC16</i> and <i>ETV6</i> mutations often occurred in tumors with early clinical staging. Our data provide a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of mutations in a small subset of GI-DLBCLs. The genetic mutation profiles of GI-DLBCL differ from those of nodal DLBCL and DLBCL in immune-privileged sites. The different mutated genes are related to the NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathways, and the different pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the development of DLBCL may be influenced by the tissue microenvironment. Differences in genetic alterations might influence the clinicopathological characteristics of GI-DLBCL.	2021	03	23	Front Oncol	Li	Peifeng
33777778	10.3389/fonc.2021.628807	Mutational Profile and Clonal Evolution of Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Primary refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) is an unresolved issue for DLBCL treatment and new treatments to overcome resistance is required. To explore the genetic mechanisms underlying treatment resistance in rrDLBCL and to identify candidate genes, we performed targeted deep sequencing of 430 lymphoma-related genes from 58 patients diagnosed with rrDLBCL. Genetic alterations found between the initial biopsy and biopsy at recurrence or refractory disease were investigated. The genes most frequently altered (&gt; 20%) were (in decreasing order of frequency) <i>CDKN2A, PIM1, CD79B, TP53, MYD88, MYC, BTG2, BTG1, CDKN2B, DTX1, CD58, ETV6</i>, and <i>IRF4</i>. Genes mutation of which in pretreatment sample were associated with poor overall survival included <i>NOTCH1</i>, <i>FGFR2</i>, <i>BCL7A</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, <i>SPEN</i> and <i>TP53</i> (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>FGFR2, BCL2</i>, <i>BCL6</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, and <i>TP53</i> were associated with poor progression-free survival (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Most mutations were truncal and were maintained in both the initial biopsy and post-treatment biopsy with high dynamics of subclones. Immune-evasion genes showed increased overall mutation frequency (<i>CD58, B2M</i>) and variant allele fraction (<i>CD58</i>), and decreased copy number (<i>B2M, CD70</i>) at the post-treatment biopsy. Using the established mutational profiles and integrative analysis of mutational evolution, we identified information about candidate genes that may be useful for the development of future treatment strategies.	2021	03	30	Front Oncol	Lee	Boram
33964277	10.1016/j.humpath.2021.04.014	Relative frequency and clinicopathologic characteristics of MYC-rearranged follicular lymphoma.	MYC rearrangement is a relatively rare genetic abnormality in follicular lymphoma (FL). In this study, we evaluated the relative frequency of MYC rearrangement in 522 cases of FL and studied their clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for MYC (break-apart probe), MYC/IGH, IGH/BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements were performed on tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical stains for CD10, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were performed and scored on MYC-rearranged cases. On 4 FL cases, a custom targeted panel of 356 genes was used for mutation analysis. Ten cases (1.9%) were positive for MYC rearrangement. Histologically, 6 of 10 cases were grade 1-2, and 4 cases were grade 3A. By immunohistochemistry, 9 of 9 tested cases were CD10+, all cases were BCL6+, and 9/10 cases were BCL2+. MYC protein staining was low in all cases tested. IGH/BCL2 rearrangement was detected in 5 of 9 cases, whereas BCL6 rearrangement was detected in 3 of 7 tested cases and 4 of 10 cases showed MYC/IGH rearrangement. The most commonly detected mutations in the MYC-positive cases included HLA-B, TNFRSF14, and KMT2D. MYC and/or B2M abnormalities were detected in 2 cases. In conclusion, MYC rearrangement is uncommon in FL and these cases do not appear to have specific histologic characteristics. Molecular analysis showed abnormalities in genes associated with transformation, namely MYC and B2M. Larger studies are needed to evaluate if MYC-rearrangement in FL has prognostic significance.	2021	12	28	Hum Pathol	Chaudhary	Shweta
34050029	10.1073/pnas.2104504118	Genetic mechanisms of HLA-I loss and immune escape in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Fifty percent of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases lack cell-surface expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), thus escaping recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Here we show that, across B cell lymphomas, loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL. To identify the involved mechanisms, we performed whole exome and targeted HLA deep-sequencing in 74 DLBCL samples, and found somatic inactivation of <i>B2M</i> and the <i>HLA-I</i> loci in 80% (34 of 42) of MHC-I<sup>NEG</sup> tumors. Furthermore, 70% (22 of 32) of MHC-I<sup>POS</sup> DLBCLs harbored monoallelic HLA-I genetic alterations (MHC-I<sup>POS/mono</sup>), indicating allele-specific inactivation. MHC-I<sup>NEG</sup> and MHC-I<sup>POS/mono</sup> cases harbored significantly higher mutational burden and inferred neoantigen load, suggesting potential coselection of <i>HLA-I</i> loss and sustained neoantigen production. Notably, the analysis of &gt;500,000 individuals across different cancer types revealed common germline <i>HLA-I</i> homozygosity, preferentially in DLBCL. In mice, germinal-center B cells lacking HLA-I expression did not progress to lymphoma and were counterselected in the context of oncogene-driven lymphomagenesis, suggesting that additional events are needed to license immune evasion. These results suggest a multistep process of <i>HLA-I</i> loss in DLBCL development including both germline and somatic events, and have direct implications for the pathogenesis and immunotherapeutic targeting of this disease.	2021	12	09	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Fangazio	Marco
34050261	10.1038/s41375-021-01284-4	Lymphoma and multiple myeloma in cohorts of persons exposed to ionising radiation at a young age.	There is limited evidence that non-leukaemic lymphoid malignancies are radiogenic. As radiation-related cancer risks are generally higher after childhood exposure, we analysed pooled lymphoid neoplasm data in nine cohorts first exposed to external radiation aged &lt;21 years using active bone marrow (ABM) and, where available, lymphoid system doses, and harmonised outcome classification. Relative and absolute risk models were fitted. Years of entry spanned 1916-1981. At the end of follow-up (mean 42.1 years) there were 593 lymphoma (422 non-Hodgkin (NHL), 107 Hodgkin (HL), 64 uncertain subtype), 66 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 122 multiple myeloma (MM) deaths and incident cases among 143,136 persons, with mean ABM dose 0.14 Gy (range 0-5.95 Gy) and mean age at first exposure 6.93 years. Excess relative risk (ERR) was not significantly increased for lymphoma (ERR/Gy = -0.001; 95% CI: -0.255, 0.279), HL (ERR/Gy = -0.113; 95% CI: -0.669, 0.709), NHL + CLL (ERR/Gy = 0.099; 95% CI: -0.149, 0.433), NHL (ERR/Gy = 0.068; 95% CI: -0.253, 0.421), CLL (ERR/Gy = 0.320; 95% CI: -0.678, 1.712), or MM (ERR/Gy = 0.149; 95% CI: -0.513, 1.063) (all p-trend &gt; 0.4). In six cohorts with estimates of lymphatic tissue dose, borderline significant increased risks (p-trend = 0.02-0.07) were observed for NHL + CLL, NHL, and CLL. Further pooled epidemiological studies are needed with longer follow-up, central outcome review by expert hematopathologists, and assessment of radiation doses to lymphoid tissues.	2021	12	31	Leukemia	Little	Mark P
34312841	10.1111/bjh.17719	Liquid biopsy: a non-invasive approach for Hodgkin lymphoma genotyping.	The Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) genomic landscape is hardly known due to the scarcity of tumour cells in the tissue. Liquid biopsy employing circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can emerge as an alternative tool for non-invasive genotyping. By using a custom next generation sequencing (NGS) panel in combination with unique molecule identifiers, we aimed to identify somatic variants in the ctDNA of 60 HL at diagnosis. A total of 277 variants were detected in 36 of the 49 samples (73·5%) with a good quality ctDNA sample. The median number of variants detected per patient was five (range 1-23) with a median variant allele frequency of 4·2% (0·84-28%). Genotyping revealed somatic variants in the following genes: SOCS1 (28%), IGLL5 (26%), TNFAIP3 (23%), GNA13 (23%), STAT6 (21%) and B2M (19%). Moreover, several poor prognosis features (high LDH, low serum albumin, B-symptoms, IPI ≥ 3 or at an advanced stage) were related to significantly higher amounts of ctDNA. Variant detection in ctDNA by NGS is a feasible approach to depict the genetic features of HL patients at diagnosis. Our data favour the implementation of liquid biopsy genotyping for the routine evaluation of HL patients.	2021	12	23	Br J Haematol	Alcoceba	Miguel
34374220	10.1002/cjp2.223	c-MYC and p53 expression highlight starry-sky pattern as a favourable prognostic feature in R-CHOP-treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically heterogeneous entity, in which the first-line treatment currently consists of an immuno-chemotherapy regimen (R-CHOP). However, around 30% of patients will not respond or will relapse. Overexpression of c-MYC or p53 is frequently found in DLBCL, but an association with prognosis remains controversial, as for other biomarkers previously linked with DLBCL aggressivity (CD5, CD23, or BCL2). The aim of this study was to explore the expression of these biomarkers and their correlation with outcome, clinical, or pathological features in a DLBCL cohort. Immunohistochemical (c-MYC, p53, BCL2, CD5, and CD23), morphological ('starry-sky' pattern [SSP]), targeted gene panel sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses were performed on tissue microarray blocks for a retrospective cohort of 94 R-CHOP-treated de novo DLBCL. In univariate analyses, p53 overexpression (p53<sup>high</sup> ) was associated with unfavourable outcome (p = 0.04) and with c-MYC overexpression (p = 0.01), whereas c-MYC overexpression was linked with an SSP (p = 0.004), but only tended towards an inferior prognosis (p = 0.06). Presence of a starry-sky morphology was found to be correlated with better survival in p53<sup>high</sup> DLBCL (p = 0.03) and/or c-MYC-positive DLBCL (p = 0.002). Furthermore, NGS data revealed that these three variables were associated with somatic mutations (PIM1, TNFRSF14, FOXO1, and B2M) involved in B-cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and immune signalling. Taken together, these results show that the SSP pattern seems to be a protective factor in high-risk DLBCL subgroups and highlight cell death as a built-in failsafe mechanism to control tumour growth.	2022	02	08	J Pathol Clin Res	Bouroumeau	Antonin
34478526	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005215	Frequent mutated B2M, EZH2, IRF8, and TNFRSF14 in primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma reflect a GCB phenotype.	Primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PB-DLBCL) is a rare extranodal lymphoma subtype. This retrospective study elucidates the currently unknown genetic background of a large clinically well-annotated cohort of DLBCL with osseous localizations (O-DLBCL), including PB-DLBCL. A total of 103 patients with O-DLBCL were included and compared with 63 (extra)nodal non-osseous (NO)-DLBCLs with germinal center B-cell phenotype (NO-DLBCL-GCB). Cell-of-origin was determined by immunohistochemistry and gene-expression profiling (GEP) using (extended)-NanoString/Lymph2Cx analysis. Mutational profiles were identified with targeted next-generation deep sequencing, including 52 B-cell lymphoma-relevant genes. O-DLBCLs, including 34 PB-DLBCLs, were predominantly classified as GCB phenotype based on immunohistochemistry (74%) and NanoString analysis (88%). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of an extended-NanoString/Lymph2Cx revealed significantly different GEP clusters for PB-DLBCL as opposed to NO-DLBCL-GCB (P &lt; .001). Expression levels of 23 genes of 2 different targeted GEP panels indicated a centrocyte-like phenotype for PB-DLBCL, whereas NO-DLBCL-GCB exhibited a centroblast-like constitution. PB-DLBCL had significantly more frequent mutations in four GCB-associated genes (ie, B2M, EZH2, IRF8, TNFRSF14) compared with NO-DLBCL-GCB (P = .031, P = .010, P = .047, and P = .003, respectively). PB-DLBCL, with its corresponding specific mutational profile, was significantly associated with a superior survival compared with equivalent Ann Arbor limited-stage I/II NO-DLBCL-GCB (P = .016). This study is the first to show that PB-DLBCL is characterized by a GCB phenotype, with a centrocyte-like GEP pattern and a GCB-associated mutational profile (both involved in immune surveillance) and a favorable prognosis. These novel biology-associated features provide evidence that PB-DLBCL represents a distinct extranodal DLBCL entity, and its specific mutational landscape offers potential for targeted therapies (eg, EZH2 inhibitors).	2021	11	01	Blood Adv	de Groen	Ruben A L
35008340	10.3390/cancers14010176	Recent Advances in the Genetic of MALT Lymphomas.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms with B-cell origin, occurring in adult patients and usually having an indolent clinical behavior. These lymphomas may arise in different anatomic locations, sharing many clinicopathological characteristics, but also having substantial variances in the aetiology and genetic alterations. Chromosomal translocations are recurrent in MALT lymphomas with different prevalence among different sites, being the 4 most common: t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(3;14)(p14.1;q32). Several chromosomal numerical abnormalities have also been described, but probably represent secondary genetic events. The mutational landscape of MALT lymphomas is wide, and the most frequent mutations are: <i>TNFAIP3</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>TET2</i>, <i>SPEN</i>, <i>KMT2D</i>, <i>LRP1B</i>, <i>PRDM1</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>TNFRSF14</i>, <i>NOTCH1/NOTCH2</i>, and <i>B2M</i>, but many other genes may be involved. Similar to chromosomal translocations, certain mutations are enriched in specific lymphoma types. In the same line, variation in immunoglobulin gene usage is recognized among MALT lymphoma of different anatomic locations. In the last decade, several studies have analyzed the role of microRNA, transcriptomics and epigenetic alterations, further improving our knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms in MALT lymphoma development. All these advances open the possibility of targeted directed treatment and push forward the concept of precision medicine in MALT lymphomas.	2022	01	14	Cancers (Basel)	Rodríguez-Sevilla	Juan José
31782146	10.1111/bjh.16263	New prognosis score including absolute lymphocyte/monocyte ratio, red blood cell distribution width and beta-2 microglobulin in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP: Spanish Lymphoma Group Experience (GELTAMO).	The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is the most widely used score for non-Hodgkin lymphoma but lacks the ability to identify a high-risk population in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Low absolute lymphocyte count and high monocytes have proved to be unfavourable factors. Red-cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with inflammation and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) with tumour load. The retrospective study included 992 patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. In the multivariate analysis, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), stage, bulky mass, B2M, RDW, and lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) were independently related to progression-free survival (PFS). A new prognosis score was generated with these variables including age categorized into three groups (0, 1, 2 points); ECOG ≥ 3-4 with two; stage III/IV, bulky mass, high B2M, LMR &lt; 2·25 and RDW &gt; 0·96 with one each; for a maximum of 9. This score could improve the discrimination of a very high-risk subgroup with five-year PFS and overall survival (OS) of 19% and 24% versus 45% and 59% of R (revised)-IPI respectively. This score also showed greater predictive ability than IPI. A new score is presented including complete blood cell count variables and B2M, which are readily available in real-life practice without additional tests. Compared to R-IPI, it shows a more precise high-risk assessment and risk discrimination for both PFS and OS.	2020	11	13	Br J Haematol	Bento	Leyre
31804029	10.1111/ejh.13364	Evaluation of the MD Anderson tumor score for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the rituximab era.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive heterogeneous lymphoma with standard treatment. However, 30%-40% of patients still fail, so we should know which patients are candidates for alternative therapies. IPI is the main prognostic score but, in the rituximab era, it cannot identify a very high-risk (HR) subset. The MD Anderson Cancer Center reported a score in the prerituximab era exclusively considering tumor-related variables: Tumor Score (TS). We aim to validate TS in the rituximab era and to analyze its current potential role. From GELTAMO DLBCL registry, we selected those patients homogeneously treated with R-CHOP (n = 1327). Five-years PFS and OS were 62% and 74%. All variables retained an independent prognostic role in the revised TS (R-TS), identifying four different risk groups, with 5-years PFS of 86%, 71%, 50%, and very HR (28%). With a further categorization of three variables of the original TS (Ann Arbor Stage, LDH and B2M), we generated a new index that allowed an improvement in HR assessment. (a) All variables of the original TS retain an independent prognostic role, and R-TS remains predictive in the rituximab era; (b) R-TS and additional categorization of LDH, B2M, and AA stage (enhanced TS) increased the ability to identify HR subsets.	2021	01	18	Eur J Haematol	Gutierrez	Antonio
31822802	10.1038/s41379-019-0428-0	Diagnostic utility of STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> expression in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and related entities.	Although the distinction of classical Hodgkin lymphoma from nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma using morphology and immunostains is straightforward in most instances, occasional cases pose diagnostic challenge. We sought to determine the utility of the novel YE361 STAT6 rabbit monoclonal antibody in Hodgkin lymphoma and diagnostically challenging B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma entities with Hodgkin-like features. Cases from seven institutions included: 57 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (31% EBV+), 34 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas, 34 mimicking B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 7 reactive lymphoproliferations. After review of histology, STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> immunostaining was performed. The intensity and spatial localization of immunopositivity was assessed in neoplastic cells. Additional FISH for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) was performed in one patient in paired treatment-naive and relapse biopsy tissues. Two STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> immunopositive cases were examined by whole-exome sequencing after flow sorting to assess mutations in STAT6 pathway genes. Most classical Hodgkin lymphomas showed nuclear staining for STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> [46/57 cases (80%)] on Hodgkin cells. Staining was exclusively nuclear in a minority [12/46 (26%)], while dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization was more common [34/46 (74%)]. In contrast, all nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas [0/34 (0%)] were negative for nuclear STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> staining on the lymphocyte predominant cells. Within B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, nuclear STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> was seen in: B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Strong PD-L1 gene amplification was noted in the paired cHL and relapse B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, although STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> was negative in both biopsies.

32172489	10.1007/s10637-020-00916-3	Phase I dose escalation study of BI 836826 (CD37 antibody) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	BI 836826 is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 antibody targeting CD37, a tetraspanin transmembrane protein predominantly expressed on normal and malignant B cells. This phase I, open-label study used a modified 3 + 3 design to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of BI 836826 in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; NCT01403948). Eligible patients received up to three courses comprising an intravenous infusion (starting dose: 1 mg) once weekly for 4 weeks followed by an observation period of 27 (Course 1, 2) or 55 days (Course 3). Patients had to demonstrate clinical benefit before commencing treatment beyond course 2. Forty-eight patients were treated. In the dose escalation phase (1-200 mg) involving 37 Caucasian patients, the MTD was 100 mg. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in four patients during the MTD evaluation period, and included stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. The most common adverse events were neutropenia (57%), leukopenia (57%), and thrombocytopenia (41%), and were commonly of grade 3 or 4. Overall, 18 (38%) patients experienced infusion-related reactions, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. Preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity was seen; three patients responded to treatment, including one complete remission in a Korean patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. BI 836826 plasma exposure increased more than proportionally with increasing doses. BI 836826 demonstrated preliminary activity; the most frequent adverse events were hematotoxicity and infusion-related reactions which were manageable after amending the infusion schedule. Although BI 856826 will not undergo further clinical development, these results confirm CD37 as a valid therapeutic target in B cell NHL.	2021	09	02	Invest New Drugs	Kroschinsky	Frank
32304999	10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102731	Circulating tumor DNA predicts response in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma treated with sintilimab.	Blood-based biomarker such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising tool for assessment of response to immunotherapy in solid tumors; But in hematological malignances, evidences are still lacking to support its clinical utility. In current study the feasibility of ctDNA for prediction and monitoring of response to anti-PD-1 therapy in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r cHL) was assessed. A total of 192 plasma samples from 75 patients with r/r cHL were collected at baseline and upon therapeutic evaluation. ctDNA were sequenced by targeting panels capturing frequently mutated genes in cHL and other hematological malignancies and then quantified. Analysis on: 1) Gene mutation profile and association of the gene mutations with progression-free survival; 2) Association of pre- and post-treatment ctDNA variant allelic frequencies with clinical outcome; (3) Correlation of the mutated genes with treatment resistance; were performed. Somatic mutations were detected in 50 out of 61 patients by ctDNA genotyping. The mutations of CHD8 was significantly higher in patients with PFS ≥ 12 months. Baseline ctDNA was significantly higher in responders and a decrease of ctDNA ≥ 40% from baseline indicated superior clinical outcome. Strong agreement between ctDNA dynamic and radiographic response change during therapy was observed in majority of the patients. Furthermore, the mutations of B2M, TNFRSF14 and KDM2B were found to be associated with acquired resistance. ctDNA could be an informative biomarker for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in r/r cHL.

32399964	10.1002/ijc.33049	Molecular profiling of Chinese R-CHOP treated DLBCL patients: Identifying a high-risk subgroup.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically aggressive and heterogenous disease. Although most patients can be cured by immunochemotherapy, 30% to 40% patient will ultimately develop relapsed or refractory disease. Here, we investigated the molecular landscapes of patients with diverse responses to R-CHOP. We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on baseline samples of 105 DLBCL patients using a panel consisting of 112 lymphoma-related genes. Subsequently, 81 treatment-naïve patients with measurable disease and followed for over 1 year were included for survival analysis. Collectively, the most commonly seen mutations included IGH fusion (69%), PIM1(33%), MYD88 (29%), BCL2 (29%), TP53 (29%), CD79B (25%) and KMT2D (24%). Patients with TP53 mutations were more likely to have primary refractory disease (87.0% vs 50.0%, P = .009). For those with TP53 disruptive mutations, 91.7% patients were in the primary refractory group. Interestingly, BCL-2 somatic hypermutation was only seen in patients without primary refractory disease (P = .014). In multivariate analysis, BCL-2 amplification (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.94, P = .022), B2M mutation (HR = 2.99, P = .017) and TP53 mutation (HR = 3.19, P &lt; .001) were independently associated with shorter time to progression (TTP). Furthermore, TP53 mutations was correlated with worse overall survival (P = .049). Next, we investigated mutation landscape in patients with wild-type (WT) TP53 (n = 58) and found that patients harboring MYD88 L265P had significantly inferior TTP than those with WT or non-265P (P = .046). Our study reveals the mutation spectrum of treatment-naive Chinese DLBCL patients. It also confirms the clinical significance of TP53 mutations and indicates the prognostic value of MYD88 L265P in TP53 WT patients.	2021	04	19	Int J Cancer	Jiang	Shiyu
30108156	10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0058	Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Hodgkin Lymphoma Reveals Recurrently Mutated Genes and Increased Mutation Burden.	The genomic landscape of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has been difficult to characterize due to the paucity of neoplastic cells and an abundant microenvironment. Such characterization is needed in order to improve treatment strategies. We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using targeted next-generation sequencing on archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples from 63 patients to analyze the landscape of HL. CGP was successful for 49/63 archival specimens (78%), and revealed aberrations impacting genes including <i>B2M</i>, <i>TP53</i>, and <i>XPO1</i> (E571). Of the 34 patients for whom total mutation burden (TMB; mutations/megabase [Mb]) was assessed, 5 (15%) had high TMB (≥20 mutations/Mb), 18 (53%) had intermediate TMB (6-19 mutations/Mb), and 11 (32%) had low TMB (≤5 mutations/Mb). We next tested 13 patients' plasma cell-free DNA with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction for the presence of <i>XPO1</i> E571 mutation, which was confirmed in the plasma of 31% of patients. In three patients with serially collected plasma samples, <i>XPO1</i> E571K allelic frequency changes corresponded with changes in tumor size on conventional radiographic imaging. The study demonstrates that comprehensive genomic profiling of archival Hodgkin lymphoma tumor samples is feasible and leads to the identification of genes that are recurrently mutated and that Hodgkin lymphoma has increased mutation burden in the majority of samples analyzed. Furthermore, tracking of <i>XPO1</i> E571 mutant allele frequency in a subset of patients may also represent a potential disease-monitoring strategy and warrants further investigation. This study provides the first evidence that comprehensive genomic profiling can be performed to map the genomic landscape of Hodgkin lymphoma and that a subpopulation of patients has mutations in <i>TP53</i>, <i>B2M</i>, <i>XPO1</i>, and other genes. It was found that 15% of patients have high mutation burden, which, in cancers such as melanoma, may indicate sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and may thus be explored for Hodgkin lymphoma. Lastly, this work demonstrates that changes in the mutant allele frequency of <i>XPO1</i> in serially collected plasma cell-free DNA samples correspond with treatment outcomes measured with conventional radiographic imaging.	2020	03	20	Oncologist	Liang	Winnie S
30591526	10.1182/blood-2018-08-862292	Single-cell RNA-Seq of follicular lymphoma reveals malignant B-cell types and coexpression of T-cell immune checkpoints.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a low-grade B-cell malignancy that transforms into a highly aggressive and lethal disease at a rate of 2% per year. Perfect isolation of the malignant B-cell population from a surgical biopsy is a significant challenge, masking important FL biology, such as immune checkpoint coexpression patterns. To resolve the underlying transcriptional networks of follicular B-cell lymphomas, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 34 188 cells derived from 6 primary FL tumors. For each tumor, we identified normal immune subpopulations and malignant B cells, based on gene expression. We used multicolor flow cytometry analysis of the same tumors to confirm our assignments of cellular lineages and validate our predictions of expressed proteins. Comparison of gene expression between matched malignant and normal B cells from the same patient revealed tumor-specific features. Malignant B cells exhibited restricted immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain expression (either Igκ or Igλ), as well the expected upregulation of the <i>BCL2</i> gene, but also downregulation of the <i>FCER2</i>, <i>CD52</i>, and major histocompatibility complex class II genes. By analyzing thousands of individual cells per patient tumor, we identified the mosaic of malignant B-cell subclones that coexist within a FL and examined the characteristics of tumor-infiltrating T cells. We identified genes coexpressed with immune checkpoint molecules, such as <i>CEBPA</i> and <i>B2M</i> in regulatory T (Treg) cells, providing a better understanding of the gene networks involved in immune regulation. In summary, parallel measurement of single-cell expression in thousands of tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be used to obtain a systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment and identify new avenues for therapeutic development.	2019	11	12	Blood	Andor	Noemi
30792096	10.1016/j.clml.2019.01.003	Next Generation Sequencing-based Validation of the Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma: An Analysis of the MMRF CoMMpass Study.	The clinical application of the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) for multiple myeloma may be limited by heterogeneity in clinical interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) practices for detecting chromosomal abnormalities (CAs). Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based FISH (Seq-FISH) has demonstrated improved sensitivity and similar specificity relative to clinical FISH, and provides a standardized, single-pass method for identifying high-risk CAs. To date, calculating R-ISS stage using Seq-FISH (R-ISS-NGS) has not been validated. We identified 672 patients with sufficient data to calculate R-ISS-NGS from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass Study. R-ISS-NGS was calculated from original ISS stage, lactate dehydrogenase, and CAs detected by Seq-FISH. Endpoints included overall survival and progression-free survival. We conducted multivariate analyses controlling for age and gender in order to compare outcomes across stages I to III of both the original ISS and R-ISS-NGS. The median follow-up was 24 months. The R-ISS-NGS resulted in significant redistribution of patients into stage II, relative to the original ISS. With respect to stage I, R-ISS-NGS stages II and III of were associated with worse progression-free survival or overall survival, more so than the staging schema of the ISS, thus validating the use of Seq-FISH in staging. Using CAs detected by Seq-FISH and data from the CoMMpass study, we validated the R-ISS with a large, generalizable cohort. This study validates the substitution of Seq-FISH for clinical FISH, especially in large registry studies. Additionally, use of the validated R-ISS-NGS will strengthen outcomes research generated from the CoMMpass study.	2020	07	06	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Goldsmith	Scott R

Short responses to immunochemotherapy predict for an inferior OS in follicular lymphoma. We set out to determine whether this is also the case in marginal zone lymphoma. A group of 139 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) patients treated with front-line immuno- or immunochemotherapy (I/ICT) were categorized into I/ICT-refractory (non-response or relapse/progression within six months of treatment response assessment) or I/ICT-sensitive. Twenty-three patients (17%) were refractory. Refractory patients had inferior OS (4-yr probabilities of 57% vs. 83%, <i>p</i> = .0003) as did those with beta2-microglobulin (B2M)&gt;3 mg/L (4-yr probabilities of 80% vs. 100%, <i>p</i> = .0029). On multivariable analysis they both showed a borderline significant correlation with OS (<i>p</i> = .06 and .07, respectively). B2M &gt; 3 mg/L was also an adverse prognostic factor for progression-free survival in both univariable (4-yr probability of 61% vs. 83%, <i>p</i> = .02) and multivariable analysis (HR 2.9, <i>p</i> = .02). In conclusion, B2M and refractoriness to I/ICT may identify patients with MZL at higher risk of inferior survival.	2020	08	17	Leuk Lymphoma	Sorigue	Marc
31006875	10.1002/ajh.25493	Detection of extranodal and spleen involvement by FDG-PET imaging predicts adverse survival in untreated follicular lymphoma.	Predicting early clinical failure in patients with untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) is important but difficult. This study aimed to determine the incidence and patterns of extranodal (EN) and spleen disease using PET/CT, and assess their utility in predicting early clinical failure. PET/CT images from 613 cases of untreated FL (2003-2016) were reviewed. The location and number of EN sites, patterns of bone involvement, and splenic involvement were recorded. Outcomes were assessed using event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and early clinical failure at 24 months (EFS24). So, 49% (301/613) of patients had PET/CT-detected EN involvement, and 28% (171/613) had spleen involvement. The presence of ≥2 EN sites, spleen, bone or soft tissue involvement all predicted failure to achieve EFS24. Presence of ≥2 EN sites and bone involvement pattern were also predictive of OS in a univariate analysis. In a multivariate analysis with FLIPI-2 factors, spleen involvement, pattern of bone involvement, and soft tissue involvement independently predicted a lower EFS (HR 1.49 (1.11-2.00), P = .007; HR 1.71 (1.10-2.65), P = .017; and HR 1.67 (1.06-2.62), P = .026, respectively). When the multivariate analysis was performed using PRIMA-PI factors (marrow and B2M), the number of EN sites was an independent prognostic factor for inferior OS (HR 2.28; P = .05). Baseline PET/CT identifies EN involvement in nearly half of patients with untreated FL. The presence of ≥2 EN sites, bone, soft tissue, or splenic involvement predicts early clinical failure. These results, when combined with other factors, may better identify high-risk patients and guide therapy.	2020	03	10	Am J Hematol	St-Pierre	Frédérique
31205619	10.1016/j.csbj.2019.03.006	Application of PD-1 Blockade in Cancer Immunotherapy.	The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway has received considerable attention due to its role in eliciting the immune checkpoint response of T cells, resulting in tumor cells capable of evading immune surveillance and being highly refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Application of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as checkpoint inhibitors is rapidly becoming a promising therapeutic approach in treating tumors, and some of them have successfully been commercialized in the past few years. However, not all patients show complete responses and adverse events have been noted, suggesting a better understanding of PD-1 pathway mediated immunosuppression is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here, we review the progresses on the studies of the mechanistic role of PD-1 pathway in the tumor immune evasion, recent clinical development and commercialization of PD-1 pathway inhibitors, the toxicities associated with PD-1 blockade observed in clinical trials as well as how to improve therapeutic efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy.	2020	09	28	Comput Struct Biotechnol J	Wu	Xiaomo
31211907	10.1111/ejh.13274	The tumour microenvironment is immuno-tolerogenic and a principal determinant of patient outcome in EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL) is a recently identified entity. Data regarding outcome to frontline immuno-chemotherapy are conflicting. Although the prognostic impact of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in EBV<sup>-neg</sup> DLBCL is well-established, it remains untested whether the TME influences survival in EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL. There are no data with new digital gene expression technologies that simultaneously interrogate the virus, B cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME). We used the NanoString™ platform in a population-based cohort of 433 patients to establish if the technology could detect EBV in the tumour biopsies and to investigate the influence that EBV has on the complex tumour microenvironment of DLBCL. Incidence of EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL was 6.9% with 5-year survival of 65% vs 82% in EBV<sup>-neg</sup> DLBCL (P = 0.018). EBV<sup>-pos</sup> tissues had similar expression of T-cell genes compared to EBV<sup>-neg</sup> DLBCL but higher levels of the antigen-presenting molecule B2M. This was countered by elevated PD-L1, PD-L2, LAG3 and TIM3 immune checkpoints and a higher CD163/CD68 ""M2"" macrophage score. In EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL, the TME is immuno-tolerogenic and may explain the poor outcomes seen in this subtype of DLBCL.	2020	01	24	Eur J Haematol	Keane	Colm
31292115	10.1182/blood.2019001126	Integrative genomic analysis identifies key pathogenic mechanisms in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) represents a clinically and pathologically distinct subtype of large B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, molecular studies, including global gene expression profiling, have provided evidence that PMBL is more closely related to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Although targeted sequencing studies have revealed a number of mutations involved in PMBL pathogenesis, a comprehensive description of disease-associated genetic alterations and perturbed pathways is still lacking. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 95 PMBL tumors to inform on oncogenic driver genes and recurrent copy number alterations. The integration of somatic gene mutations with gene expression signatures provides further insights into genotype-phenotype interrelation in PMBL. We identified highly recurrent oncogenic mutations in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and nuclear factor κB pathways, and provide additional evidence of the importance of immune evasion in PMBL (<i>CIITA, CD58, B2M, CD274,</i> and <i>PDCD1LG2</i>). Our analyses highlight the interferon response factor (IRF) pathway as a putative novel hallmark with frequent alterations in multiple pathway members (<i>IRF2BP2, IRF4,</i> and <i>IRF8</i>). In addition, our integrative analysis illustrates the importance of <i>JAK1, RELB,</i> and <i>EP300</i> mutations driving oncogenic signaling. The identified driver genes were significantly more frequently mutated in PMBL compared with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, whereas only a limited number of genes were significantly different between PMBL and cHL, emphasizing the close relation between these entities. Our study, performed on a large cohort of PMBL, highlights the importance of distinctive genetic alterations for disease taxonomy with relevance for diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making.	2020	01	27	Blood	Mottok	Anja
31324639	10.1182/bloodadvances.2018026591	IgA levels at diagnosis predict for infections, time to treatment, and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	To better understand the relationship between baseline immunoglobulin measurements and subsequent clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we performed a retrospective analysis on 660 patients with CLL (72%), monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) (13%), and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (14%), diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 at CancerCare Manitoba. Of 511 patients who had their first immunoglobulin level determined within 3 months of diagnosis, abnormal (either increased or decreased) immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA values were observed in 58% of patients with CLL, 27% of patients with MBL, and 20% of patients with SLL. Immunoglobulin deviances were similar for MBL and CLL Rai stage 0 and for SLL and Rai stages I and II; for CLL, IgG and IgA abnormalities occurred with increasing frequency with advancing Rai stage. In contrast, the frequency of IgM abnormalities was similar in all patient groups. IgA abnormalities significantly correlated with high β2-microglobulin (B2M) expression, whereas abnormal IgG and IgA levels were associated with the use of <i>IGHV</i>1-69, 3-21, and 3-49 subtypes. Increases in IgG or IgM were commonly associated with the presence of a CLL-type M-band, whereas oligoclonal bands were frequently observed with increased IgA levels. Although abnormal levels of IgG and IgA at diagnosis were independent predictors for future immunoglobulin replacement, only abnormal IgA levels were associated with shorter time to first treatment and overall survival. These findings indicate that both reduced and elevated levels of IgG and IgA at diagnosis are important and independent prognostic markers for infection in CLL, with IgA being more relevant as a marker of disease progression and survival.	2020	07	07	Blood Adv	Ishdorj	Ganchimeg
31423206	10.3892/ol.2019.10410	Clinical significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and histone deacetylases 1 and 2 expression in peripheral T-cell lymphoma.	Epigenetics serve a key role in peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) expression in PTCL. A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the present study, including 43 with PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), 10 with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 14 with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TCL) and 15 with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). EZH2 and HDAC1/2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and any correlations between them were evaluated. Additionally, any correlations between EZH2 or HDAC1/2 expression and a number of clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed, and survival curves were created. Results revealed that 55.8% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 86.7% of patients ALCL and 50% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC1. Furthermore, 58.1% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 53.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC2. Additionally, 67.5% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 50% of patients with NK/TCL, 73.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed EZH2. EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with the presence of B symptoms, elevated LDH and elevated β2 microglobulin (B2M; P&lt;0.05), and HDAC2 expression was significantly correlated with sex, advanced clinical stages, high international prognostic index scores and elevated B2M levels (P&lt;0.05) in all the patients with PTCL. However, different subtypes of PTCL are correlated with different clinical characteristics. Patients with PTCL highly expressing EZH2 or HDAC2 exhibit a poorer overall survival rate. In conclusion, EZH2 and HDAC1/2 were frequently upregulated in patients with PTCL, and the patients with a higher EZH2 and HDAC2 expression usually exhibited a poorer survival rate. Therefore, EZH2 and HDAC2 may be prognostic markers in patients with PTCL, particularly in those with PTCL-NOS.	2020	10	01	Oncol Lett	Zhang	Huilai
31597848	10.11406/rinketsu.60.1229	[The immune microenvironment in malignant lymphoma].	Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the importance of the tumor microenvironment. Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from lymphocytes and typically develop in lymphoid tissues. It has been recognized that the elements of the lymphoma microenvironment are not mere bystanders to a host antitumor inflammatory response but are important components of the tumor that support proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of lymphoma cells. Lymphoma cells have individual expression patterns of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, according to their histological subtypes, and the patterns of surface molecules determine the sites of tumor involvement. Lymphoma cells often depend on the signals provided by non-tumor cells, such as stromal cells and macrophages, through direct cell contact and paracrine factors. On the other hand, there are genetic and non-genetic mechanisms allowing lymphoma cells to escape from anti-tumor immunity, such as downregulation of HLA molecules, B2M, CD58, CD70, and/or upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Further understanding of the interactions of lymphoma cells and the tumor microenvironment gives an insight into the pathogenesis of lymphomas and supports new approaches to their treatment.	2019	10	25	Rinsho Ketsueki	Nishikori	Momoko

31697821	10.1182/blood.2019002067	Genomic analyses of PMBL reveal new drivers and mechanisms of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade.	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBLs) are aggressive tumors that typically present as large mediastinal masses in young women. PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional, and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations -somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants-in a cohort of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identified a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL, including known and newly identified components of the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identified driver mutations in ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modifier, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identified several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related lymphoid malignancies.	2020	04	13	Blood	Chapuy	Bjoern
31816062	10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001012	Genomic analyses of flow-sorted Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells reveal complementary mechanisms of immune evasion.	Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is composed of rare malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells within an extensive, but ineffective, inflammatory/immune cell infiltrate. HRS cells exhibit near-universal somatic copy gains of chromosome 9p/9p24.1, which increase expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligands. To define genetic mechanisms of response and resistance to PD-1 blockade and identify complementary treatment targets, we performed whole-exome sequencing of flow cytometry-sorted HRS cells from 23 excisional biopsies of newly diagnosed cHLs, including 8 Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) tumors. We identified significantly mutated cancer candidate genes (CCGs) as well as somatic copy number alterations and structural variations and characterized their contribution to disease-defining immune evasion mechanisms and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT, and PI3K signaling pathways. EBV- cHLs had a higher prevalence of genetic alterations in the NF-κB and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathways. In this young cHL cohort (median age, 26 years), we identified a predominant mutational signature of spontaneous deamination of cytosine- phosphate-guanines (""Aging""), in addition to apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like, activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated hypermutation. In particular, the mutational burden in EBV- cHLs was among the highest reported, similar to that of carcinogen-induced tumors. Together, the overall high mutational burden, MSI-associated hypermutation, and newly identified genetic alterations represent additional potential bases for the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in cHL. Of note, recurrent cHL alterations, including B2M, TNFAIP3, STAT6, GNA13, and XPO1 mutations and 2p/2p15, 6p21.32, 6q23.3, and 9p/9p24.1 copy number alterations, were also identified in &gt;20% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas, highlighting shared pathogenetic mechanisms in these diseases.	2020	09	22	Blood Adv	Wienand	Kirsty
29289361	10.1016/j.blre.2017.12.001	The pathobiology of primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Implications for novel therapies.	Primary testicular lymphomas (PTL) are the most prevalent type of testicular cancer arising in men over the age of 60. PTL accounts for approximately 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and most present with localized disease but despite this, outcome is poor. The majority of cases represent an extranodal manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), known as primary testicular DLBCL (PT-DLBCL). Gene expression profiling has established that over 75% of PT-DLBCLs resemble the activated B-cell-like (ABC) or non-germinal center subtype of nodal DLBCL. In distilling the specific mutational landscape and immunophenotypic profiles, immune-escape and sustained signalling emerge as prominent features of PT-DLBCL. These include genomic alterations arising within the core components of antigen presentation (CIITA, B2M, and HLA loci) and structural rearrangements of programmed death ligands 1 (CD274) and 2 (PDCD1LG2). Enrichment for somatic mutations within NF-κB pathway genes (MYD88, CD79B, NFKBIZ, BCL10, and MALT1) also feature prominently in PT-DLBCL. Taken together, the unique molecular and clinical characteristics of PT-DLBCL have informed on aspects of the distinct disease biology of this organotypic lymphoma that may guide rational therapeutic strategies.	2019	03	21	Blood Rev	Twa	David D W
29394125	10.1200/JCO.2017.77.3994	Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II and Programmed Death Ligand 1 Expression Predict Outcome After Programmed Death 1 Blockade in Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma.	Purpose Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells evade antitumor immunity by multiple means, including gains of 9p24.1/ CD274(PD-L1)/ PDCD1LG2(PD-L2) and perturbed antigen presentation. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor blockade is active in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) despite reported deficiencies of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on HRS cells. Herein, we assess bases of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) in the CheckMate 205 trial. Methods HRS cells from archival tumor biopsies were evaluated for 9p24.1 alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization and for expression of PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the antigen presentation pathway components-β2-microglobulin, MHC class I, and MHC class II-by immunohistochemistry. These parameters were correlated with clinical responses and progression-free survival (PFS) after PD-1 blockade. Results Patients with higher-level 9p24.1 copy gain and increased PD-L1 expression on HRS cells had superior PFS. HRS cell expression of β2-microglobulin/MHC class I was not predictive for complete remission or PFS after nivolumab therapy. In contrast, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was predictive for complete remission. In patients with a &gt; 12-month interval between myeloablative autologous stem-cell transplantation and nivolumab therapy, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was associated with prolonged PFS. Conclusion Genetically driven PD-L1 expression and MHC class II positivity on HRS cells are potential predictors of favorable outcome after PD-1 blockade. In cHL, clinical responses to nivolumab were not dependent on HRS cell expression of MHC class I.	2019	08	01	J Clin Oncol	Roemer	Margaretha G M
29625928	10.1016/j.clml.2018.03.005	Serum Free Light Chain Difference and β<sub>2</sub> Microglobulin Levels Are Risk Factors for Thromboembolic Events in Patients With AL Amyloidosis.	AL amyloidosis might increase the risk of thromboembolism and other plasma cell dyscrasias; however, only a few reports have described the clinical features of thromboembolism. The present study aimed to elucidate the clinical features of thromboembolic events and to identify the risk factors for these events. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed to define the clinically significant thromboembolic events. A total of 106 patients with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis were included. During a median follow-up of 18.1 months (range, 0.4-166.9 months), 13 thromboembolism events were identified in 13 patients. Of the 13 patients, 9 (8.5%) experienced acute cerebral infarction, 2 (1.9%) experienced pulmonary embolism, and 2 (1.9%) experienced deep vein thrombosis. Patients with a higher serum free light chain (FLC) difference (≥ 172.4 mg/L) or β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β2MG) levels (≥ 2.78 mg/L) experienced significantly more thromboembolic events compared with those with a lower value according to multivariable analysis (for FLC difference: hazard ratio, 4.309; 95% confidence interval, 1.158-16.032; P = .029; for β2MG: hazard ratio, 9.739; 95% confidence interval, 1.127-84.174; P = .039). Most thromboembolic events (11 of 13; 84.6%) occurred within the first year after the AL amyloidosis diagnosis. The incidence of thromboembolism was substantial in those with AL amyloidosis. A greater FLC difference and for β2MG levels were risk factors for thromboembolic events.	2019	08	06	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Park	Hyunkyung
29657120	10.1016/j.canrad.2017.11.005	Breast lymphoma occurring after an invasive ductal breast carcinoma developed in the same area: A case report and literature review.	Chemo- and radiotherapy are treatments very helpful to cure cancers but are also well known for adverse effects such as secondary cancers. Breast cancers following Hodgkin lymphoma have been relatively well studied. Breast cancers after radiotherapy covering or nearby breasts or nipples are usually carcinomas or secondary sarcomas. Among the big cohort of patients treated for breast carcinomas, breast lymphomas developed in the same area are not usual. Nevertheless, published studies described a significant increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma after initial radiotherapy for a solid cancer. Here, we report a case of a secondary breast lymphoma observed in a 53-year-old woman treated 13 years before for a ductal carcinoma and analyse such second tumors with a review of the literature. This case report emphasizes the importance of the biopsy in case of recurrence in breast cancer to give the appropriate treatment.	2018	05	17	Cancer Radiother	Demoor-Goldschmidt	C
29857068	10.1016/j.jid.2018.04.038	Genomic Analyses Identify Recurrent Alterations in Immune Evasion Genes in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Leg Type.	Cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are aggressive lymphomas with a poor prognosis. To elucidate their genetic bases, we analyzed exome sequencing of 37 cutaneous DLBCLs, including 31 DLBCLs, leg type (DLBCL-LT) and 6 cutaneous DLBCLs-not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS). As reported previously, 77% of DLBCL-LT harbor NF-κB-activating MYD88 mutations. In nearly all MYD88-wild-type DLBCL-LT, we found cancer-promoting mutations that either activate the NF-κB pathway through alternative genes (NFKBIE or REL) or activate other canonical cancer pathways (BRAF, MED12, PIK3R1, and STAT3). After NF-κB, the second most commonly mutated pathway putatively enables immune evasion via mutations predicted to downregulate antigen processing (B2M, CIITA, HLA) or T-cell co-stimulation (CD58). DLBCL-LT have little genetic overlap with the genetically heterogeneous DLBCL-NOS. Instead, they resemble primary central nervous system and testicular large B-cell lymphomas (primary central nervous system lymphomas and primary testicular lymphomas). Like primary central nervous system lymphomas/primary testicular lymphomas, 40% of DLBCL-LT (vs. 0% of DLBCLs-not otherwise specified) harbored PDL1/PDL2 translocations, which lead to overexpression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 in 50% of the cases. Collectively, these data broaden our understanding of cutaneous DLBCLs and suggest novel therapeutic approaches (e.g., BRAF or PI3K inhibitors). Additionally, they suggest novel treatment paradigms, wherein DLBCL-LT can be targeted with strategies (e.g., immune checkpoint blockers) currently being developed for genomically similar primary central nervous system lymphomas/primary testicular lymphomas.	2019	09	13	J Invest Dermatol	Zhou	Xiaolong Alan
29872358	10.1177/1179299X18776974	Clean Colorectum at Diagnostic Colonoscopy: Subsequent Detection of Extracolonic Malignancies by Plasma Protein Biomarkers?	Most of the subjects undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy do not have neoplastic bowel lesions. Potentially, some of the symptoms may therefore be caused by extracolonic malignancy, and subjects with persisting symptoms may need subsequent examinations. Blood-based, cancer-associated biomarkers may aid in directing the examinations for other specific malignant diseases. EDTA plasma samples available from a previous prospective study of subjects undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy were used for analysis of 18 protein biomarkers. The study population of 3732 subjects included 400 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 177 patients with extracolonic malignancies. Univariable analysis of the association of specific biomarkers and extracolonic cancers included those with 10 or more cases. Subsequently, reduced models of 4 or 6 biomarkers, respectively, were established by choosing those with the highest likelihood; age and sex were included as well. Univariable analyses showed that CyFra21-1 had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.87 for lung cancers (n = 33), CA19-9 had an AUC of 0.85 for pancreatic cancer (n = 22), CA125 had an AUC of 0.95 for ovary cancer (n = 16), B2M had an AUC of 0.81 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 12), and total prostate-specific antigen had an AUC of 0.99 for prostate cancer (n = 10). The multivariable analysis of 4 or 6 biomarkers plus age and sex as explanatory variables showed AUCs of 0.82 to 0.85 both for extracolonic cancers and CRC. The 4 biomarkers included in the model for detection of extracolonic cancers were CA125, hsCRP, CA19-9, and CyFra21-1; the 2 additional for the 6 biomarkers model were CEA and Galectin-3. Similarly, the 4 biomarkers included in the model for detection of CRC were CEA, CyFra21-1, Ferritin, and HE4; the two additional for the 6 biomarkers model were hsCRP and Pepsinogen 2. Results of this study indicate that it may be possible to detect subjects that have an increased risk of extracolonic cancer following a colonoscopy without findings of neoplastic lesions. Combinations of various protein biomarkers may direct subsequent examination after colonoscopy with clean colorectum. The results, although preliminary, may form the basis for additional research directed both for primary examinations of subjects with symptoms of malignancy and subsequent examinations after colonoscopy.	2022	03	17	Biomark Cancer	Wilhelmsen	Michael
30087457	10.1038/s41374-018-0096-6	Novel cell enrichment technique for robust genetic analysis of archival classical Hodgkin lymphoma tissues.	Approximately 15% of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) die after relapse or progressive disease. Comprehensive genetic characterization is required to better understand its molecular pathology and improve management. However, genetic information on cHL is hard to obtain mainly due to rare malignant Hodgkin- and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSC), whose overall frequencies in the affected tissues ranges from 0.1 to 10%. Therefore, enrichment of neoplastic cells is necessary for the majority of genetic investigations. We have developed a new high-throughput method for marker-based enrichment of archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue-derived HRSC nuclei by fluorescence-assisted flow sorting (FACS) and successfully applied it on ten cHL cases. Genomic DNA extracted from sorted nuclei was used for targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 68 genes that are frequently affected in lymphomas. Chromosomal copy number aberrations were investigated by the Agilent SurePrint 180k microarray. Our method enabled HRSC nuclei enrichment to 40-90% in sorted populations. This level of enrichment was sufficient for reliable identification of tumor-specific mutations and copy number aberrations. Genetic analysis revealed that components of JAK-STAT signaling pathway were affected in all investigated tumors by frequent mutations of SOCS1 and STAT6 as well as copy number gains of JAK2. Involvement of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway compounds was evident from recurrent gains of the locus containing the REL gene and mutations in TNFAIP3 and CARD11. Finally, genetic alterations of PD-L1 and B2M suggested immune evasion as mechanisms of oncogenesis in some patients. In this work, we present a new method for HRSC enrichment from FFPE tissue blocks by FACS and demonstrate the feasibility of a wide-scale genetic analysis by cutting-edge molecular methods. Our work opens the door to a large resource of archived clinical cHL samples and lays foundation to more complex studies aimed to answer important biological and clinical questions that are critical to improve cHL management.	2019	06	13	Lab Invest	Juskevicius	Darius
28302137	10.1186/s13045-017-0438-7	Mutations of CREBBP and SOCS1 are independent prognostic factors in diffuse large B cell lymphoma: mutational analysis of the SAKK 38/07 prospective clinical trial cohort.	Recently, the mutational background of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been revealed, identifying specific genetic events that drive lymphomagenesis. However, the prognostic value of these mutations remains to be determined. Prognostic biomarkers in DLBCL are urgently needed, since the current clinical parameter-based factors (e.g., International Prognostic Index (IPI)) are insufficient, particularly in identifying patients with poor prognosis who might benefit from alternative treatments. We investigated the prognostic value of somatic mutations in DLBCL in a clinical trial (NCT00544219) patient cohort homogenously treated with six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), followed by two cycles of R (R-CHOP-14). The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of tumor genomic DNA was performed on all exons or hotspots of 68 genes frequently mutated in B cell lymphomas. Mutational data was correlated with the endpoints to identify prognostic associations. Targeted HTS detected somatic mutations in 71/76 (93%) of investigated cases. The most frequently mutated genes were KMT2D, SOCS1, GNA13, and B2M. Survival analysis revealed that CREBBP- and EP300-mutated cases had significantly worse OS, PFS, and EFS. In addition, ATM mutations predicted worse outcomes for all three clinical endpoints in germinal center B cell-like DLBCL. In contrast, SOCS1 mutations were associated with better PFS. On multivariable analysis taken into account IPI and failure to achieve complete remission, CREBBP and EP300 mutations remained significant to predict worse OS, PFS, and EFS. Targeted mutation analysis of a uniformly treated prospective clinical trial DLBCL cohort identifies tumor-based genetic prognostic markers that could be useful in the clinical management of such patients.

28372509	10.1080/10428194.2017.1307981	FcγRIIb expression in early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	In normal B-cells, B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling can be negatively regulated by the low-affinity receptor FcγRIIb (CD32b). To better understand the role of FcγRIIb in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we correlated its expression on 155 samples from newly-diagnosed Binet A patients with clinical characteristics and outcome. FcγRIIb expression was similar in normal B-cells and leukemic cells, this being heterogenous among patients and within CLL clones. FcγRIIb expression did not correlate with well known prognostic markers [disease stage, serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), IGHV mutational status, expression of ZAP-70 and CD38, and cytogenetics] except for a weak concordance with CD49d. Moreover, patients with low FcγRIIb expression (69/155, 44.5%) required therapy earlier than those with high FcγRIIb expression (86/155, 55.5%) (median 151.4 months vs. not reached; p=.071). These results encourage further investigation on the role of FcγRIIb in CLL biology and prognostic significance in larger series of patients.	2018	04	17	Leuk Lymphoma	Bosch	Rosa
28398499	10.1093/annonc/mdx128	Outcome of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP: results from the UK NCRI R-CHOP14v21 trial with combined analysis of molecular characteristics with the DSHNHL RICOVER-60 trial.	There is an on-going debate whether 2- or 3-weekly administration of R-CHOP is the preferred first-line treatment for elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The UK NCRI R-CHOP14v21 randomized phase 3 trial did not demonstrate a difference in outcomes between R-CHOP-14 and R-CHOP-21 in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients aged 19-88 years, but data on elderly patients have not been reported in detail so far. Here, we provide a subgroup analysis of patients ≥60 years treated on the R-CHOP14v21 trial with extended follow-up. Six hundred and four R-CHOP14v21 patients ≥60 years were included in this subgroup analysis, with a median follow-up of 77.7 months. To assess the impact of MYC rearrangements (MYC-R) and double-hit-lymphoma (DHL) on outcome in elderly patients, we performed a joint analysis of cases with available molecular data from the R-CHOP14v21 (N = 217) and RICOVER-60 (N = 204) trials. Elderly DLBCL patients received high dose intensities with median total doses of ≥98% for all agents. Toxicities were similar in both arms with the exception of more grade ≥3 neutropenia (P &lt; 0.0001) and fewer grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia (P = 0.05) in R-CHOP-21 versus R-CHOP-14. The elderly patient population had a favorable 5-year overall survival (OS) of 69% (95% CI: 65-73). We did not identify any subgroup of patients that showed differential response to either regimen. In multivariable analysis including individual factors of the IPI, gender, bulk, B2M and albumin levels, only age and B2M were of independent prognostic significance for OS. Molecular analyses demonstrated a significant impact of MYC-R (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.22-3.16; P = 0.01) and DHL (HR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.18-4.11; P = 0.01) on OS in the combined trial cohorts, independent of other prognostic factors. Our data support equivalence of both R-CHOP application forms in elderly DLBCL patients. Elderly MYC-R and DHL patients have inferior prognosis and should be considered for alternative treatment approaches.

28419429	10.1111/bjh.14633	Mutational landscape of B-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders.	It is currently unclear whether post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PT-DLBCL) display a similar genomic landscape as DLBCL in immunocompetent patients (IC-DLBCL). We investigated 50 post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) including 37 PT-DLBCL samples for somatic mutations frequently observed in IC-DLBCL. Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using the Ion Torrent platform and a customized panel of 68 genes was performed on genomic DNA. Non-tumoural tissue was sequenced to exclude germline variants in cases where available. A control cohort of 76 IC-DLBCL was available for comparative analyses. In comparison to IC-DLBCLs, PT-DLBCL showed more frequent mutations of TP53 (P = 0·004), and absence of ATM and B2M mutations (P = 0·004 and P = 0·016, respectively). In comparison to IC-DLBCLs, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)<sup>+</sup> PT-DLBCL had fewer mutated genes (P = 0·007) and particularly fewer mutations in nuclear factor-κB pathway-related genes (P = 0·044). TP53 mutations were more frequent in EBV<sup>-</sup> PT-DLBCL as compared to IC-DLBCL (P = 0·001). Germinal centre B cell (GCB) subtype of PT-DLBCL had fewer mutations and mutated genes than GCB-IC-DLBCLs (P = 0·048 and 0·04 respectively). Polymorphic PTLD displayed fewer mutations as compared to PT-DLBCL (P = 0·001). PT-DLBCL differs from IC-DLBCL with respect to mutations in genes related to DNA damage control and immune-surveillance, and EBV association is likely to have a bearing on the mutational pattern.	2017	09	05	Br J Haematol	Menter	Thomas
29228708	10.18632/oncotarget.21963	Blood biomarkers in adults with lymph node enlargement contribute to diagnostic significance of malignancy.	Lymph node enlargement is a common presentation and has a possibility of malignancy like lymphoma that requires early diagnosis. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of these patients and finds out useful predictors of malignant diseases. We retrospectively investigated 81 patients with lymph node enlargement between July 2, 2014 and May 17, 2016. The characteristics and laboratory findings were evaluated combining with the final diagnosis. The diagnoses were malignancy in 51 patients and benign lymphadenopathy in 30 patients. Increased beta2-microglobulin (B2M) (<i>P</i> = 0.012) was found to be associated with malignant diseases, and level of 3699.5 μg/L was used as a cut-off value to differentiate the malignancies from benign diseases, offering 63.4% sensitivity and 87.0% specificity. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) (<i>P</i> = 0.038) levels were significantly lower in malignant group, whose receiver operating characteristic curve showed that level of 1121.5 mg/dl had sensitivity and specificity as 58.5% and 82.6%. Moreover, through analysis of cytokines, we found interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were elevated in malignant group compared with benign group. Serum B2M and IgG levels were concluded to be useful parameters for predicting malignancies. Besides, increased IL-10 levels indicated a higher risk of malignancy in some way.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Ma	Shanshan
25689467	10.1002/hon.2188	Serum beta-2 microglobulin as a prognostic biomarker in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.	Although serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested as a prognostic factor for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), additional data are necessary to confirm its role. Between November 2005 and July 2014, a total of 52 patients with MCL were identified from the database of Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Pretreatment serum B2M information was available in 50 patients (96%). Overall survival (OS) was compared according to the serum B2M level with a cut-off value of 2.5 mg/L. The median MCL international prognostic index (MIPI) score was 5.84 (range 4.72-7.80), and the median biologic MIPI (MIPI-b) score was 6.27 (4.93-8.47). Pretreatment serum B2M was elevated in 30 patients (60%) and was significantly related to advanced stage (p = 0.02) and high MIPI (p = 0.03) and MIPI-b (p = 0.03) scores. With median follow-up duration of 29.8 months (range 0.8-87.0 months), the median OS was 56.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 36.6-75.9 months] in all patients, and serum B2M was significantly associated with OS (p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses adjusted for MIPI or MIPI-b scores and rituximab, elevated serum B2M was significantly associated with poor OS (when adjusting MIPI, hazard ratio = 26.4, 95% CI 2.9-241.3, p = 0.004; when adjusting MIPI-b, hazard ratio = 20.1, 95% CI 2.4-170.1, p = 0.006). Thus, pretreatment serum B2M may be an independent and significant prognostic factor in patients with MCL.	2016	07	27	Hematol Oncol	Yoo	Changhoon
26268515	10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000042	Evaluation of serum and urine fetuin-A levels in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during and after high-dose methotrexate therapy: Relation to toxicity.	Fetuin-A is a multifunctional protein with its urine level was considered as a marker of acute kidney injury. We investigated the serum and urine fetuin-A in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children during and after high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). Twenty-two ALL children and 20 matched healthy controls were included. Liver transaminases, serum creatinine, estimated glomular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine clearance (CrCl), serum β2 microglobulin (B2M), and serum and urine fetuin-A levels were assayed pre and 4 months after the consolidation. Among a subgroup of 15 patients, the investigations were performed 42 hours after the start of the second and the fourth HDMTX infusions. HDMTX was well tolerated. During HDMTX, there was significant decline in serum fetuin-A together with significant rise of urine fetuin-A and B2M levels compared to the control and to the pre-consolidation levels, changes that persisted 4 months after the consolidation despite recovery of the significantly altered renal functions. The second HDMTX-related serum fetuin-A level directly correlated with eGFR and CrCl (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.0001 and r = 0.67, P = 0.016, respectively). Four months after consolidation, urine fetuin-A directly correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.54, P = 0.004) and inversely correlated with the eGFR (r = -0.66, P &lt; 0.0001). Significant disturbance in serum and urinary fetuin-A levels, which was related to renal functions, had occurred during HDMTX and persisted for at least 4 months after the consolidation. Serum and urine fetuin-A could be sensitive markers for subtle renal dysfunction in ALL children.	2017	03	02	Hematology	Ragab	Seham M

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by heterogeneous clinical behavior and there is a need for improved biomarkers. The current study evaluated the prognostic significance of serum free light chains (sFLC, kappa, and lambda) and other serum markers (bar, serum thymidine kinase (sTK), soluble CD23, and LDH) together with established biomarkers in 289 patients enrolled into the LRF CLL4 trial. In a multivariable analysis of serum markers alone, higher big and kappa light chains were statistically significant in predicting disease progression and higher blg, and sTK in predicting mortality. In multivariable analysis for overall survival the following were independently significant: β2M levels, immunoglobulin gene (IGHV) mutational status (&gt;98% homology), age, 17p13 deletions (&gt;10%), and CD38 expression. β2M is the only serum marker that retained clear independent value as a biomarker in the LRF CLL4 trial and remains powerfully prognostic requiring evaluation in any future method of risk stratifying patients.	2017	12	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Pratt	Guy
26752561	10.1371/journal.pone.0146624	Proteomics Based Identification of Proteins with Deregulated Expression in B Cell Lymphomas.	Follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas comprise the main entities of adult B cell malignancies. Although multiple disease driving gene aberrations have been identified by gene expression and genomic studies, only a few studies focused at the protein level. We applied 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare seven GC B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines with a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). An average of 130 spots were at least two folds different in intensity between NHL cell lines and the LCL. We selected approximately 38 protein spots per NHL cell line and linked them to 145 unique spots based on the location in the gel. 34 spots that were found altered in at least three NHL cell lines when compared to LCL, were submitted for LC-MS/MS. This resulted in 28 unique proteins, a substantial proportion of these proteins were involved in cell motility and cell metabolism. Loss of expression of B2M, and gain of expression of PRDX1 and PPIA was confirmed in the cell lines and primary lymphoma tissue. Moreover, inhibition of PPIA with cyclosporine A blocked cell growth of the cell lines, the effect size was associated with the PPIA expression levels. In conclusion, we identified multiple differentially expressed proteins by 2-D proteomics, and showed that some of these proteins might play a role in the pathogenesis of NHL. 	2016	07	04	PLoS One	Wu	Rui

To determine the prognostic significance of beta2 microglobulin (β2-m) concentrations in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare disorder caused by pathologic activation of the immune system. The study population consisted of 74 patients diagnosed with HLH and 35 healthy controls. Serum β2-m levels were measured using a latex agglutination photometric immunoassay. Median serum β2-m levels were significantly higher in HLH patients than in healthy controls (4.05 versus 1.5 mg/L; P &lt; 0.001) and were significantly higher in patients with lymphoma associated hemophagocytic syndrome (LAHS) than in patients with benign disease-associated HLH (4.2 versus 3.3 mg/L; P &lt; 0.001). Higher serum β2-m levels were positively correlated with LAHS (P = 0.005), abnormal lactate dehydrogenase concentrations (P = 0.009), and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.003). ROC analysis showed that overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in LAHS patients with serum β2-m levels ≥4.03 mg/L compared to &lt;4.03 mg/L (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that serum β2-m level was an independent prognostic of OS (P = 0.034) in patients with LAHS. High serum β2-m levels and LAHS were associated with markedly poorer OS in patients with HLH. Serum β2-m concentration was a powerful and independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with LAHS.	2016	12	13	Dis Markers	Jiang	Tiantong
27276707	10.18632/oncotarget.9793	Relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma present different genomic profiles between early and late relapses.	Despite major advances in first-line treatment, a significant proportion of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will experience treatment failure. Prognosis is particularly poor for relapses occurring less than one year after the end of first-line treatment (early relapses/ER) compared to those occurring more than one year after (late relapses/LR). To better understand genomic alterations underlying the delay of relapse, we identified copy number variations (CNVs) on 39 tumor samples from a homogeneous series of patients included in the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) prospective study. To identify CNVs associated with ER or LR, we devised an original method based on Significance Analysis of Microarrays, a permutation-based method which allows control of false positives due to multiple testing. Deletions of CDKN2A/B (28%) and IBTK (23%) were frequent events in relapsed DLBCLs. We identified 56 protein-coding genes and 25 long non-coding RNAs with significantly differential CNVs distribution between ER and LR DLBCLs, with a false discovery rate &lt; 0.05. In ER DLBCLs, CNVs were related to transcription regulation, cell cycle and apoptosis, with duplications of histone H1T (31%), deletions of DIABLO (26%), PTMS (21%) and CK2B (15%). In LR DLBCLs, CNVs were related to immune response, with deletions of B2M (20%) and CD58 (10%), cell proliferation regulation, with duplications of HES1 (25%) and DVL3 (20%), and transcription regulation, with MTERF4 deletions (20%). This study provides new insights into the genetic aberrations in relapsed DLBCLs and suggest pathway-targeted therapies in ER and LR DLBCLs.	2018	02	21	Oncotarget	Broséus	Julien
27389058	10.1038/leu.2016.161	Emerging therapies provide new opportunities to reshape the multifaceted interactions between the immune system and lymphoma cells.	The acquisition of a complete neoplastic phenotype requires cancer cells to develop escape mechanisms from the host immune system. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'immune evasion,' represents a hallmark of cancers and results from a Darwinian selection of the fittest tumor clones. First reported in solid tumors, cancer immunoescape characterizes several hematological malignancies. The biological bases of cancer immunoescape have recently been disclosed and include: (i) impaired human leukocyte antigen-mediated cancer cell recognition (B2M, CD58, CTIIA, CD80/CD86, CD28 and CTLA-4 mutations); (ii) deranged apoptotic mechanisms (reduced pro-apoptotic signals and/or increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules); and (iii) changes in the tumor microenvironment involving regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. These immune-escape mechanisms characterize both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin (B and T cell) lymphomas and represent a promising target for new anti-tumor therapies. In the present review, the principles of cancer immunoescape and their role in human lymphomagenesis are illustrated. Current therapies targeting these pathways and possible applications for lymphoma treatment are also addressed.	2017	08	29	Leukemia	Pizzi	M
27835906	10.18632/oncotarget.13239	Whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although rituximab therapy improves clinical outcome, some patients develop resistant DLBCL; however, the genetic alterations in these patients are not well documented. To identify the genetic background of refractory DLBCL, we conducted whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing for six patients with refractory and seven with responsive DLBCL. The average numbers of pathogenic somatic single nucleotide variants and indels in coding regions were 71 in refractory patients (range 28-120) and 38 (range 19-66) in responsive patients. Missense mutations of TP53 were exclusive in 50% (3/6) of refractory patients and involved the DNA-binding domain of TP53. All missense mutations of TP53 were accompanied by copy number deletions. RAB11FIP5, PRKCB, PRDM15, FNBP4, AHR, CEP128, BRE, DHX16, MYO6, and NMT1 mutations were recurrent in refractory patients. MYD88, B2M, SORCS3, and WDFY3 mutations were more frequent in refractory patients than in responsive patients. REL-BCL11A fusion was found in two refractory patients; one had both fusion and copy number gain. Recurrent copy gains of POU2AF1, SLC1A4, REL11, FANCL, CACNA1D, TRRAP, and CUX1 with significantly increased average expression were found in refractory patients. The expression profile revealed enriched gene sets associated with treatment resistance, including oxidative phosphorylation and ATP-binding cassette transporters. In conclusion, this study integrated both genomic and transcriptomic alterations associated with refractory DLBCL and found several treatment-resistance alterations that may contribute to refractoriness.	2018	02	22	Oncotarget	Park	Ha Young
27959929	10.1371/journal.pmed.1002197	Histological Transformation and Progression in Follicular Lymphoma: A Clonal Evolution Study.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet incurable B cell malignancy. A subset of patients experience an increased mortality rate driven by two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early progression after immunochemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading to these clinical end points is poorly understood, and previously determined genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology over the time course of FL clinical histories. Using a combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, and digital droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse specimens, we deciphered the constituent clonal populations in 15 transformation cases and 6 progression cases, and measured the change in clonal population abundance over time. We observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in transformed cases relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were generally composed of clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens, consistent with dramatic clonal expansions that came to dominate the transformation specimens. This pattern was independent of time to transformation and treatment modality. By contrast, early progression specimens were composed of clones that were already present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only moderate clonal dynamics, even in the presence of immunochemotherapy. Analysis of somatic mutations impacting 94 genes was undertaken in an extension cohort consisting of 395 samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted biology in the two clinical end points. We found 12 genes that were more commonly mutated in transformed samples than in the preceding FL tumors, including TP53, B2M, CCND3, GNA13, S1PR2, and P2RY8. Moreover, ten genes were more commonly mutated in diagnostic specimens of patients with early progression, including TP53, BTG1, MKI67, and XBP1. Our results illuminate contrasting modes of evolution shaping the clinical histories of transformation and progression. They have implications for interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of treatment-induced selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and progression will require different clinical management strategies.	2017	05	23	PLoS Med	Kridel	Robert
24913511	10.3109/10428194.2014.917640	Prognostic impact of β₂-microglobulin in patients with non-gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	Although serum β₂-microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested as a prognostic factor for several hematologic malignancies, it has not been comprehensively investigated in non-gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Between January 2000 and May 2013, a total of 174 patients with non-gastric MALT lymphoma were identified from a prospectively developed database. Baseline serum B2M was elevated in 17 (10%) patients. In univariate analysis, serum B2M ≥ 2.5 mg/L was significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS, p &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (OS, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified serum B2M as an independent prognostic factor in PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-10.0; p = 0.02) and OS (HR = 26.9, 95% CI: 2.7-269.7; p = 0.005), after adjustment for IPI and treatment modalities. Baseline serum B2M is an independent prognostic factor in patients with non-gastric MALT lymphoma.	2016	03	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Yoo	Changhoon
25488972	10.1182/blood-2014-11-610436	Flow sorting and exome sequencing reveal the oncogenome of primary Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells.	Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by sparsely distributed Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells amid reactive host background, complicating the acquisition of neoplastic DNA without extensive background contamination. We overcame this limitation by using flow-sorted HRS and intratumor T cells and optimized low-input exome sequencing of 10 patient samples to reveal alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation, chromosome integrity, transcriptional regulation, and ubiquitination. β-2-microglobulin (B2M) is the most commonly altered gene in HRS cells, with 7 of 10 cases having inactivating mutations that lead to loss of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression. Enforced wild-type B2M expression in a cHL cell line restored MHC-I expression. In an extended cohort of 145 patients, the absence of B2M protein in the HRS cells was associated with lower stage of disease, younger age at diagnosis, and better overall and progression-free survival. B2M-deficient cases encompassed most of the nodular sclerosis subtype cases and only a minority of mixed cellularity cases, suggesting that B2M deficiency determines the tumor microenvironment and may define a major subset of cHL that has more uniform clinical and morphologic features. In addition, we report previously unknown genetic alterations that may render selected patients sensitive to specific targeted therapies. 	2015	04	21	Blood	Reichel	Jonathan
25577449	10.1016/j.transci.2014.12.007	Beta-2 microglobulin predicts the outcome after autologous stem cell transplantation in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an established therapeutic modality in the treatment of lymphomas, especially in the relapse setting. In the present study, we aimed to define pretransplantation factors including Beta-2 microglobulin (β2m) that influence outcomes following ASCT in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We analyzed retrospectively 78 NHL patients who had undergone ASCT from August 2010 to January 2013. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 70% and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 60%. While remission status less than complete remission (CR) emerged to be a poor prognostic factor for OS in univariate analysis, high β2m levels and comorbidity indices revealed to be independent poor risk factors for both OS and PFS. The present study demonstrated that even if the patient is in CR before ASCT if he has high β2m, the 2-year OS decreases from 100% to 49%. Moreover, lymphopenia for the first time was demonstrated to predict PFS in ASCT in NHL patients. Our findings suggest that β2m at transplantation predict the outcome after ASCT in NHL and further investigation with larger sample sizes is warranted.	2015	09	25	Transfus Apher Sci	Atesoglu	Elif Birtas
25622250	10.3390/ijms16022307	Gentamicin arrests cancer cell growth: the intriguing involvement of nuclear sphingomyelin metabolism.	The use of gentamicin for the treatment of bacterial infection has always been an interesting and highly speculated issue for the scientific community. Conversely, its effect on cancer cells has been very little investigated. We studied the effect of high doses of gentamicin on non-Hodgkin's T-cell human lymphoblastic lymphoma (SUP-T1). We showed that gentamicin delayed cell growth and induced cell death in lymphoma cells with a rather mild effect on lymphocytes. In SUP-T1 cells, GAPDH, B2M, CDKN1A and CDKN1B were down-expressed in comparison with lymphocytes. Gentamicin treatment in SUP-T1 cells restored the expression of GAPDH, B2M and CDKN1A to values similar to those of lymphocytes and caused overexpression of CDKN1B. The drug acted via sphingomyelin metabolism; in whole cells, sphingomyelinase activity was stimulated, whereas in purified nuclei, sphingomyelinase activity was inhibited and that of sphingomyelin-synthase was stimulated, with a consequent high level of nuclear sphingomyelin content. We suggest that the increase of nuclear sphingomyelin might enrich the nucleus of lipid microdomains that act as a platform for active chromatin and, thus, might be responsible for gene expression. It is possible that in lymphoblastic lymphoma, high doses of gentamicin induce a beneficial therapeutic outcome. 	2015	09	25	Int J Mol Sci	Codini	Michela
25981322	10.1016/j.bulcan.2015.03.013	[Endocrine sequelae after treatment of pediatric cancer: From childhood to adulthood].	Endocrine sequelae are among the most frequently reported complications in childhood cancer survivors, affecting 40 to 60% of these patients during adult life. Most of these complications are the result of cranial radiation therapy for brain or facial tumor, lymphoma or leukemia. The present review describes the main endocrine disturbances observed in this population, including disorders of hypothalamic-pituitary axis, especially the frequently observed growth hormone deficiency and disorders of puberty, thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction, obesity and metabolic syndrome, alterations in glucose metabolism and decreased bone mineral density. Gonadal dysfunction is not described, since it is detailed in another chapter. During childhood, prompt diagnosis and management of endocrine complications allow improvement of final height outcome and body composition (lean body mass and bone mass), reducing morbidity and impaired quality of life later in adulthood. Risk of developing a second neoplasm after growth hormone therapy in cancer survivors is also addressed. Life-long follow-up and management of endocrine deficiencies are essential to reduce late morbidity especially cardiovascular risk, and to diagnose late-onset deficiencies as well as radiation-induced thyroid nodules and cancer.	2015	09	28	Bull Cancer	Thomas-Teinturier	Cécile
25991819	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2116	Genome-Wide Analysis Uncovers Novel Recurrent Alterations in Primary Central Nervous System Lymphomas.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the central nervous system. Whether there is a PCNSL-specific genomic signature and, if so, how it differs from systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is uncertain. We performed a comprehensive genomic study of tumor samples from 19 immunocompetent PCNSL patients. Testing comprised array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole exome sequencing. Biallelic inactivation of TOX and PRKCD was recurrently found in PCNSL but not in systemic DLBCL, suggesting a specific role in PCNSL pathogenesis. In addition, we found a high prevalence of MYD88 mutations (79%) and CDKN2A biallelic loss (60%). Several genes recurrently affected in PCNSL were common with systemic DLBCL, including loss of TNFAIP3, PRDM1, GNA13, TMEM30A, TBL1XR1, B2M, CD58, activating mutations of CD79B, CARD11, and translocations IgH-BCL6. Overall, B-cell receptor/Toll-like receptor/NF-κB pathways were altered in &gt;90% of PNCSL, highlighting its value for targeted therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, integrated analysis showed enrichment of pathways associated with immune response, proliferation, apoptosis, and lymphocyte differentiation. In summary, genome-wide analysis uncovered novel recurrent alterations, including TOX and PRKCD, helping to differentiate PCNSL from systemic DLBCL and related lymphomas.	2016	06	07	Clin Cancer Res	Braggio	Esteban
26068922	10.1371/journal.pone.0129298	Plasma Hsp90 Level as a Marker of Early Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Engraftment and Progression in Mice.	Current monitoring of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in living mice is based on FACS analysis of blood hCD45+ cells. In this work, we evaluated the use of human IGFBP2, B2M or Hsp90 as soluble markers of leukemia. ELISA for B2M and IGFBP2 resulted in high background levels in healthy animals, precluding its use. Conversely, plasma levels of Hsp90 showed low background and linear correlation to FACS results. In another experiment, we compared Hsp90 levels with percentage of hCD45+ cells in blood, bone marrow, liver and spleen of animals weekly sacrificed. Hsp90 levels proved to be a superior method for the earlier detection of ALL engraftment and correlated linearly to ALL burden and progression in all compartments, even at minimal residual disease levels. Importantly, the Hsp90/hCD45+ ratio was not altered when animals were treated with dexamethasone or a PI3K inhibitor, indicating that chemotherapy does not directly interfere with leukemia production of Hsp90. In conclusion, plasma Hsp90 was validated as a soluble biomarker of ALL, useful for earlier detection of leukemia engraftment, monitoring leukemia kinetics at residual disease levels, and pre-clinical or mouse avatar evaluations of anti-leukemic drugs. 	2016	04	21	PLoS One	Milani	Mateus
26291013	10.1097/JTO.0000000000000624	PTPRF Expression as a Potential Prognostic/Predictive Marker for Treatment with Erlotinib in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.	EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements are, to date, the only approved biomarkers to select treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is considerable interest in identifying other predictive markers. The PTPRF gene has been suggested as a marker of interest in NSCLC and other tumor types. This hypothesis-generating retrospective analysis examined data from two studies of erlotinib in NSCLC, Marker Identification Trial (MERIT; n = 102) and Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable NSCLC (SATURN; n = 262), to determine whether PTPRF expression was prognostic and/or predictive of patient outcomes. Exploratory analyses were conducted using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on existing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, to assess gene expression levels, including PTPRF. High versus low levels of expression were dichotomized using the median with B2M as a control comparator. Progression-free survival and overall survival were then compared for patients with high versus low levels of PTPRF in the two studies. PTPRF expression was found to be prognostic for shorter overall survival but was also significantly predictive of improved survival with erlotinib versus placebo in SATURN (hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.30-0.69] in PTPRF high versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62-1.48] in PTPRF low; interaction p = 0.02), even in the EGFR wild-type subpopulation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.29-0.68] versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62-1.48]; interaction p = 0.01). PTPRF may have value as a predictive marker to identify which patients can obtain the greatest benefit from erlotinib in the post-first-line setting. Further research is warranted to determine the potential value of this marker in clinical decision-making.	2016	06	13	J Thorac Oncol	Soulières	Denis
26350140	10.1016/j.leukres.2015.08.016	Beta-2 microglobulin is a strong prognostic factor in patients with DLBCL receiving R-CHOP therapy.	Useful prognostic markers for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been reported. To identify which biomarker best predicts the prognosis of patients with DLBCL, we performed a retrospective study that included 319 DLBCL patients who had received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) therapy between 2003 and 2012. We assessed the prognostic significance of six biomarkers [lactate dehydrogenase, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, thymidine kinase activity, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), C-reactive protein, and ferritin] and representative clinical characteristics using progression-free survival (PFS) as the endpoint. The study group included 181 men and 138 women with a median age of 63 years (range, 22-89 years). In a multivariate analysis, the serum B2M level most strongly correlated with PFS (hazard ratio, 2.11; P=0.04). In a univariate analysis, patients with serum B2M levels &gt;1.75μg/mL (n=210) had a worse 3-year PFS rate (71.2%) than those with B2M levels &lt;1.75μg/mL (n=109; 90.0%). Therefore, serum B2M level at the time of diagnosis is a useful prognostic indicator in DLBCL patients receiving R-CHOP.	2022	03	31	Leuk Res	Miyashita	Kazuho
24180329	10.3109/10428194.2013.850167	Soluble interleukin-2 receptor level predicts survival in patients with follicular lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone chemotherapy in the rituximab era.	This study analyzed the prognostic significance of soluble interleukin-2 receptor α (sIL-2Rα) levels in 100 prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. It showed that sIL-2Rα level ≥ 115 pmol/L at the time of treatment initiation correlated with a high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 (FLIPI-2), bulky disease, advanced clinical stage, number of involved lymph nodes, bone marrow involvement and elevated β2-microglobulin (B2M) level. When testing all patients, sIL-2Rα ≥ 115 pmol/L was associated with significantly shorter progression-free (PFS; p &lt; 0.03, hazard ratio [HR] 2.04) but not overall (OS; p = 0.06, HR 2.36) survival rates. Subanalysis of patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) ± rituximab showed higher predictive power for both PFS (HR 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-6.11, p = 0.01) and OS (HR 3.33, 95% CI 1.15-9.63, p = 0.02). In the whole population (n = 100), only B2M proved a significant univariate predictor (p = 0.007, HR = 2.8) of PFS. When testing patients treated with CHOP ± rituximab, sIL-2Rα was found to be the best univariate predictor for PFS among all FLIPI-2 factors (HR = 2.68, p = 0.015). Serum IL-2Rα levels may help to refine risk assessment in the modern immunotherapy era complementary to FLIPI-2 factors.	2016	03	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Procházka	Vít
24413734	10.1038/ng.2873	Recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators, RHOA and FYN kinase in peripheral T cell lymphomas.	Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12 tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples. Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition, we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PTCL. 	2014	03	25	Nat Genet	Palomero	Teresa
24441948	10.1007/s00277-014-2015-2	Prognostic impact of beta-2 microglobulin in patients with extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma.	Although serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested as an independent prognostic factor for several lymphoproliferative diseases, it has rarely been investigated in extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). From a prospectively collected database, 145 patients with ENKTL were identified. Among them, a total of 101 patients were included in the analysis, with exclusion of patients without baseline serum B2M level and those did not receive anticancer therapy. Serum B2M (&lt;3.0 vs. ≥3.0 mg/L) was analyzed for association with overall survival (OS). Seventy-nine (78 %) patients had nasal ENKTL, and 22 (22 %) had extranasal ENKTL. In overall patients, median OS was 26.7 months (95 % confidence interval (CI), not assessable), with a median follow-up of 32.4 months (range, 0.9-155.2 months). While median OS was not reached in patients with nasal ENKTL, extranasal ENKTL group had median OS of 5.1 months (95 % CI, 1.2-8.9 months; p &lt; 0.001). Baseline serum B2M was significantly associated with OS in patients with nasal ENKTL (p &lt; 0.001). This was consistent in limited (stages I and II) nasal ENKTL (p = 0.002) and disseminated (stages III and IV) nasal ENKTL (p = 0.02). However, there was no difference of OS in extranasal ENKTL patients (p = 0.69). In multivariate analysis including other prognostic factors, elevated serum B2M was significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.8, 95 % CI 1.7-8.2, p = 0.001, in a model including Korean Prognostic Index, and HR = 3.6, 95 % CI 1.6-8.2, p = 0.002, in a model including International Prognostic Index). In patients with nasal ENKTL, baseline serum B2M is a powerful prognostic factor. The prognostic value of B2M was independent of previously established prognostic models. Further investigations are necessary to validate the role of B2M in ENKTL. 	2014	06	23	Ann Hematol	Yoo	Changhoon
24454777	10.1371/journal.pone.0084999	Correlations between functional imaging markers derived from PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.	To investigate the correlations between functional imaging markers derived from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Further to compare the usefulness of these tumor markers in differentiating diagnosis of the two common types of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Thirty-four consecutive pre-therapy adult patients with proven NHL (23 DLBCL and 11 FL) underwent PET/CT and MRI examinations and laboratory tests. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and metabolic tumor burden (MTB) were determined from the PET/CT images. DWI was performed in addition to conventional MRI sequences using two b values (0 and 800 s/mm(2)). The minimum and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(min) and ADC(mean)) were measured on the parametric ADC maps. The SUV(max) correlated inversely with the ADC(min) (r = -0.35, p&lt;0.05). The ADC(min), ADC(mean), serum thymidine kinase (TK), Beta 2-microglobulin (B2m), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and C-reactive protein (CRP) correlated with both whole-body MTV and whole-body MTB (p&lt;0.05 or 0.01). The SUV(max), TK, LD, and CRP were significantly higher in the DLBCL group than in the FL group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that they were reasonable predictors in differentiating DLBCL from FL. The functional imaging markers determined from PET/CT and DWI are associated, and the SUV(max) is superior to the ADC(min) in differentiating DLBCL from FL. All the measured serum markers are associated with functional imaging markers. Serum LD, TK, and CRP are useful in differentiating DLBCL from FL.	2014	12	28	PLoS One	Wu	Xingchen
24885312	10.1186/1471-2164-15-390	In silico analyses reveal common cellular pathways affected by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in the lymphomagenesis of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).	The analysis of cellular networks and pathways involved in oncogenesis has increased our knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie tumour biology and has unmasked new molecular targets that may lead to the design of better anti-cancer therapies. Recently, using a high resolution loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, we identified a number of potential tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) within common LOH regions across cases suffering from two of the most common forms of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). From these studies LOH of the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) gene was identified as a common event in the lymphomagenesis of these B-cell lymphomas. The present study aimed to determine the cellular pathways affected by the inactivation of these TSGs including PTPRJ in FL and DLBCL tumourigenesis. Pathway analytical approaches identified that candidate TSGs located within common LOH regions participate within cellular pathways, which may play a crucial role in FL and DLBCL lymphomagenesis (i.e., metabolic pathways). These analyses also identified genes within the interactome of PTPRJ (i.e. PTPN11 and B2M) that when inactivated in NHL may play an important role in tumourigenesis. We also detected genes that are differentially expressed in cases with and without LOH of PTPRJ, such as NFATC3 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 3). Moreover, upregulation of the VEGF, MAPK and ERBB signalling pathways was also observed in NHL cases with LOH of PTPRJ, indicating that LOH-driving events causing inactivation of PTPRJ, apart from possibly inducing a constitutive activation of these pathways by reduction or abrogation of its dephosphorylation activity, may also induce upregulation of these pathways when inactivated. This finding implicates these pathways in the lymphomagenesis and progression of FL and DLBCL. The evidence obtained in this research supports findings suggesting that FL and DLBCL share common pathogenic mechanisms. Also, it indicates that PTPRJ can play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these B-cell tumours and suggests that activation of PTPRJ might be an interesting novel chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of these B-cell tumours.	2015	01	16	BMC Genomics	Aya-Bonilla	Carlos
24969158	10.1159/000362670	Prognostic significance of serum beta-2 microglobulin in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	Elevated serum beta-2 microglobulin (β2-M) has previously been reported in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. This study examined the association between serum β2-M and the prognosis of NHL and analyzed its predictive value. A total of 287 NHL patients from Taiyuan, Shanxi, China, participated in a prospective cohort study between 2008 and 2011. Overall survival (OS) was compared between NHL patients with high and normal β2-M levels using the log-rank test. Three standard Cox regression models including the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, β2-M or IPI score+β2-M as independent variables were constructed. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves method and C index were used to examine the tendency of the models' predictive accuracy over time. NHL patients with elevated β2-M values had worse OS (p&lt;0.001) and higher mortality risk (HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.77, p&lt;0.001) than patients with normal β2-M values. There were statistically significant differences between the C indexes for the models with IPI+β2-M, IPI or β2-M alone (p&lt;0.001). Our results demonstrated an association between serum β2-M and NHL prognosis. Combining β2-M with IPI may help to improve the prognostic accuracy of NHL.	2014	09	03	Oncology	Wu	Li
25171927	10.1182/blood-2013-12-546309	Exome sequencing reveals novel mutation targets in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas derived from Chinese patients.	Next-generation sequencing studies on diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) have revealed novel targets of genetic aberrations but also high intercohort heterogeneity. Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of disease subgroups and cytogenetic profiles differ between Western and Asian patients. To characterize the coding genome of Chinese DLBCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA derived from 31 tumors and respective peripheral blood samples. The mutation prevalence of B2M, CD70, DTX1, LYN, TMSB4X, and UBE2A was investigated in an additional 105 tumor samples. We discovered 11 novel targets of recurrent mutations in DLBCL that included functionally relevant genes such as LYN and TMSB4X. Additional genes were found mutated at high frequency (≥10%) in the Chinese cohort including DTX1, which was the most prevalent mutation target in the Notch pathway. We furthermore demonstrated that mutations in DTX1 impair its function as a negative regulator of Notch. Novel and previous unappreciated targets of somatic mutations in DLBCL identified in this study support the existence of additional/alternative tumorigenic pathways in these tumors. The observed differences with previous reports might be explained by the genetic heterogeneity of DLBCL, the germline genetic makeup of Chinese individuals, and/or exposure to distinct etiological agents. 	2014	12	29	Blood	de Miranda	Noel F C C
25292288	10.1186/1471-2407-14-750	Characterization of β2-microglobulin expression in different types of breast cancer.	Βeta-2-microglobulin (β2-M) has been demonstrated as a growth factor and signaling molecule in breast cancer and leukemia. The purpose of the study is to characterize β2-M expression in molecular subtypes of breast cancer, thereby investigating the mechanism of β2-M action in breast cancer. β2-M and B-Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) transcript expression levels in breast cancer tissue and the corresponding normal tissue were quantified using real-time PCR. The protein expression levels of β2-M, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), tumor protein 53 (p53) and Ki67 were determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Following silencing of the β2-M by siRNA, the levels of Bcl-2, ER, PR and HER-2 transcripts and the protein expression levels in human breast cancer cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. The expression of β2-M transcripts demonstrated no significant differences between the four breast cancer molecular subtypes and no significant correlations with age, clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. β2-M transcript expression demonstrated a positive correlation when compared to Bcl-2 transcript expression (P&lt;0.05). The β2-M protein expression was significantly higher in breast cancer when compared with benign breast tumors (P&lt;0.01), and have no significant correlation with age, clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. There was a significant difference demonstrated in β2-M protein expression in the four breast cancer molecular subtypes (P&lt;0.05), and between the ER+ and ER- groups (P&lt;0.01); however, no significant difference was demonstrated between the HER-2+ and HER-2- groups. β2-M protein expression had a negative correlation with ER protein expression (P&lt;0.01), a positive correlation with p53 protein expression (P&lt;0.01), and no correlation with Ki67 protein expression. β2-M silencing significantly inhibited Bcl-2 mRNA expression, but did not inhibit ER, PR and HER-2 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells (ER+, PR+ and HER-2-). In addition, Bcl-2 and HER-2 mRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells (ER-, PR- and HER-2-), which is consistent with the silencing effect seen at the protein level. β2-M expression demonstrated a significant difference in the four breast cancer molecular subtypes, and may be related to apoptosis regulation in breast cancer.	2015	05	28	BMC Cancer	Li	Kesheng
23331211	10.1111/ejh.12075	Prognostic significance of programmed cell death-1-positive cells in follicular lymphoma patients may alter in the rituximab era.	Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is involved in one of the inhibitory pathways of the B7-cluster of differentiation (CD) 28 family; this pathway is known to be involved in the attenuation of T-cell responses and promotion of T-cell tolerance. PD-1 is known to negatively regulate T-cell receptor-mediated proliferation and cytokine production, lead to alternation in the tumor microenvironment. Although several studies have shown that high levels of PD-1-positive cells in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients influence their prognosis, those studies included patients treated without rituximab, and the prognostic impact of PD-1 positivity in the rituximab era (R-era) has not yet been elucidated. We retrospectively studied 82 patients with FL uniformly treated with standard R-CHOP therapy at six institutions between 2001 and 2009 (median follow-up for survivors: 55 months). We also collected and examined biopsy specimens for diagnosis with respect to PD-1 positivity. The PD-1 positivity was significantly higher in male patients and patients with high beta-2 microglobulin (B2M ≥ 3.0) (P = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively). Three-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 60% and 86%, respectively. By univariate analysis, elevated LDH (P = 0.07) worsened PFS. Male gender (P = 0.03), high FLIPI score (P = 0.05), and high B2M levels (P = 0.08) worsened OS. Multivariate analysis detected no significant prognostic factors, including PD-1 positivity. However, in male subgroup, high levels of PD-1-positive cells were found to be a prognostic factor for PFS. Addition of rituximab might have altered the prognostic impact of PD-1-positive cells.	2013	05	07	Eur J Haematol	Takahashi	Hiroyuki
23717383	10.1371/journal.pone.0059868	Serum levels of beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins are associated with systemic disease activity in primary Sjögren's syndrome. Data at enrollment in the prospective ASSESS cohort.	To analyze the clinical and immunological characteristics at enrollment in a large prospective cohort of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and to investigate the association between serum BAFF, beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins and systemic disease activity at enrollment. Three hundred and ninety five patients with pSS according to American-European Consensus Criteria were included from fifteen centers of Rheumatology and Internal Medicine in the ""Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution of Sjögren's Syndrome"" (ASSESS) 5-year prospective cohort. At enrollment, serum markers were assessed as well as activity of the disease measured with the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI). Patient median age was 58 (25(th)-75(th): 51-67) and median disease duration was 5 (2-9) years. Median ESSDAI at enrollment was 2 (0-7) with 30.9% of patients having features of systemic involvement. Patients with elevated BAFF, beta2-microglobulin and kappa, lambda FLCS had higher ESSDAI scores at enrollment (4 [2]-[11] vs 2 [0-7], P = 0.03; 4 [1]-[11] vs 2 [0-7], P&lt; 0.0001); 4 [2]-[10] vs 2 [0-6.6], P&lt; 0.0001 and 4 [2-8.2] vs 2 [0-7.0], P = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, increased beta2-microglobulin, kappa and lambda FLCs were associated with a higher ESSDAI score. Median BAFF and beta2-microglobulin were higher in the 16 patients with history of lymphoma (1173.3(873.1-3665.5) vs 898.9 (715.9-1187.2) pg/ml, P = 0.01 and 2.6 (2.2-2.9) vs 2.1 (1.8-2.6) mg/l, P = 0.04, respectively). In pSS, higher levels of beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins are associated with increased systemic disease activity.	2014	02	18	PLoS One	Gottenberg	Jacques-Eric
23859015	10.1139/bcb-2012-0110	Low expression of dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin-related protein in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and significant correlations with lactic acid dehydrogenase and β2-microglobulin.	Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin-related protein (DC-SIGNR), a type II integral membrane protein and a member of the C-type lectins, has been reported to bind various strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. Serum DC-SIGNR is not currently available for the detection of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we assessed the serum levels of DC-SIGNR in 70 cancer patients and 100 healthy controls. Additionally, using immunohistochemistry, we determined the expression of DC-SIGNR in the lymph nodes. Using the ELISA, low serum levels of DC-SIGNR were detected in the patients (median, 4.513 ng·L(-1); range, 1.066-9.232 ng·L(-1); p = 0.0003). Serum concentrations of DC-SIGNR correlated significantly with age (p = 0.0077) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (p = 0.0046) and β2-microglobulin (p = 0.0491) levels. However, we found no statistically significant correlation between serum DC-SIGNR levels and clinical data such as sex, Ann Arbor stage, B symptoms, and histologic subtypes. Moreover, NHL patients with a lower level of serum DC-SIGNR expression in lymphatic endothelial cells also showed negative immunostaining levels. These results suggest that DC-SIGNR is a biological molecule that may be potentially useful in NHL clinical settings. 	2013	12	31	Biochem Cell Biol	Zhang	Zhuqing
23898101		Beta-2 microglobulin as a diagnostic parameter in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a comparative study with FDG-PET.	The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the serum tumor marker beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) as well as positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in confirming or eliminating the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Retrospective analysis of 180 patients with NHL referred for a PET scan was performed. Patients' data regarding demographic information, clinical history, and diagnostic procedures were collected. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value of serum β2M levels and FDG-PET, compared to a compound gold standard consisting of imaging modalities (computed tomography, magnetic resonance tomography, ultrasound) and/or biopsy, were assessed and compared. β2M had a sensitivity and specificity of 49% and 52% for all types and settings, respectively, as well as a low positive predictive value (66%) and a very low negative predictive value (36%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for all types of NHL in all settings was 87% and 92%, respectively. Due to its low sensitivity and specificity, β2M cannot be used in the clinical routine as a diagnostic marker for the diagnosis of NHL. On the other hand, in accordance with previous studies, we found that FDG-PET is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of NHL.	2013	10	17	Anticancer Res	Toth	Daniel F
22373550	10.1007/s00277-012-1434-1	Serum beta2-microglobin is a predictor of prognosis in patients with upper aerodigestive tract NK/T-cell lymphoma.	Upper aerodigestive tract natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (UNKTL) is the most common type of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Serum beta2-microglobulin (β2-M) was found to be a predictor in some subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. However, its prognostic significance in NK/T-cell lymphoma has never been explored. We retrospectively analyzed 82 patients newly diagnosed as UNKTL. Serum β2-M was detected prior to treatment in this series. Various statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the significance of the relevant clinical parameters. High serum β2-M level was calculated as ≥2.5 mg/L by the median value. The number of patients with serum β2-M ≥2.5 mg/L at diagnosis was 39 (47.6%) and 43 patients (52.4%) with β2-M &lt;2.5 mg/L. Patients with high serum β2-M level at diagnosis seemed to have more adverse clinical features: B symptoms (p=0.007) and elevated LDH level (p&lt;0.001), and high KPI score (p=0.002). Serum β2-M ≥2.5 mg/L was significantly associated with poor overall survival (5-year OS, 35.2% vs 73.6%; p=0.001) and progression-free survival (5-year PFS, 27.5% vs 55.9%; p=0.028). For patients with early stage, serum β2-M at diagnosis could also help to distinguish those with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. In multivariate analysis, high serum β2-M level remained its prognostic impact on survival (OS: p=0.002; PFS: p=0.039), independent of the International Prognostic Index score. Our study suggested high serum β2-M was a novel predictor of prognosis in patients with UNKTL. A simply and regular way might be established to identify UNKTL patients of different risks at diagnosis.	2012	09	17	Ann Hematol	Li	Zhi-Ming
22475215	10.3109/10428194.2012.666662	Association of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 with poor prognosis in elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	In population studies, the relative survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) decreases with age. In this study, we demonstrated in a cohort of 189 patients from a CLL clinic that overall survival was lower in the sub-cohort of patients aged ≥ 70 years, but causes of death were similar for all age groups, being progressive CLL, secondary malignancies and infections. As normal individuals age, the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, can increase. In our patients with CLL, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels increased with age to a greater degree than in normal individuals, and the levels correlated closely with plasma β(2)-microglobulin and with one another. In addition, in patients ≥ 70 years, IL-6 was found to be a better prognostic marker than immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IgV(H)) status. In vitro studies demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-8 could enhance the binding of CLL cells to stromal cells, suggesting that their clinical activity may be mediated through their effects on the microenvironment. Thus, plasma IL-6 is an important prognostic marker for the elderly with CLL, and this study highlights that the utility of prognostic markers may depend on patient age.	2013	01	04	Leuk Lymphoma	Yoon	Ju-Yoon

23033288		Significance of tumor burden, vascular endothelial growth factor, lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin serum levels in advanced diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) are incorporated in the so-called ""serologic staging system"", as independent parameters for predicting time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. Elevated values of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF) was associated with poor survival in the largest histological subgroup, the diffuse large B cell (DLBCL) and immunoblastic lymphomas. sVEGF has independent influence on survival in multivariate models when tested together with the components of the International Prognostic Index (IPI). The purpose of this study was to define possible correlations between LDH, B2M levels and the novel prognostic parameter sVEGF, with assessed tumor burden, as another parameter of aggressiveness for advanced-stage DLBCLs. Serum samples were collected from 29 patients with DLBCL, Ann Arbor clinical stages III and IV, to measure pretreatment serum levels of LDH, B2M and sVEGF. Tumor burden was defined as low and high according to criteria's defined by Jagannath and colleagues. A trend toward significant correlation between high initial levels of sVEGF and high tumor burden was observed (p=0.077). High serum LDH level was strongly associated with high tumor burden (p=0.0091), but B2M correlation with either low or high tumor burden was not confirmed (p=0.249). Complete response (CR) rates (CR vs. non CR) and OS according to tumor burden (low vs. high) showed no statistically significant differences (p=0.245 and p=0.202). Our preliminary data confirmed association between serum LDH level and DLBCL burden with a satisfactory sensitivity-specificity relationship. The other two parameters, sVEGF and B2M, failed to demonstrate significant relationship with tumor burden.	2012	11	21	J BUON	Milanovic	N
23226803	10.3892/ol.2012.913	Detection of the Epstein-Barr virus in blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not associated with prognosis.	The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a large spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases. Traditional methods of EBV detection include the immunohistochemical identification of viral proteins and DNA probes to the viral genome in tumoral tissue. The present study explored the detection of the EBV genome, using the BALF5 gene, in the bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and related its presence to the clinical variables and risk factors. The results show that EBV detection in 21.5% of patients is not associated with age, gender, staging, B symptoms, international prognostic index scores or any analytical parameters, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β-2 microglobulin (B2M). The majority of patients were treated with R-CHOP-like (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone or an equivalent combination) and some with CHOP-like chemotherapy. Response rates [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] were not significantly different between EBV-negative and -positive cases, with 93.2 and 88.9%, respectively. The survival rate was also similar in the two groups, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 64.3 and 76.7%, respectively. However, when analyzing the treatment groups separately there was a trend in EBV-positive patients for a worse prognosis in patients treated with CHOP-like regimens that was not identified in patients treated with R-CHOP-like regimens. We conclude that EBV detection in the bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells of DLBC patients has the same frequency of EBV detection on tumoral lymphoma tissue but is not associated with the risk factors, response rate and survival in patients treated mainly with immunochemotherapy plus rituximab. These results also suggest that the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improves the prognosis associated with EBV detection in DLBCL.	2021	10	21	Oncol Lett	Marques	Herlander
20828817	10.1016/j.leukres.2010.08.006	Different prognostic factors for survival in acute and lymphomatous adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.	Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a clinically aggressive and heterogeneous entity; hence it is likely that different variants of ATLL have different prognostic factors. 95 patients with ATLL seen at our institution between 1987 and 2008 were included. Clinical data were compared, according to ATLL variant, using the Mann-Whitney and the Chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazard test were used for the univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. Median age was 61 years with male-to-female ratio of 1.07:1. Patients with acute ATLL were more likely to present with bone marrow, liver and spleen involvement, higher β2-microglobulin and lower albumin levels. Poor performance status, high IPI score, presence of B symptoms, high LDH and low albumin levels were associated with a worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL. High LDH, high β2-microglobulin and high PIT score were associated with worse survival in acute ATLL. In the multivariate analysis, low albumin level and presence of B symptoms were independent factors for worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL, and high β2-microglobulin level was independent factor for worse survival in acute ATLL. Aggressive ATLL variants have a distinct, almost mutually exclusive profile of prognostic factors.	2011	05	17	Leuk Res	Beltran	Brady
22137796	10.1016/j.ccr.2011.11.006	Combined genetic inactivation of β2-Microglobulin and CD58 reveals frequent escape from immune recognition in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the β2-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in &gt;60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.	2012	02	06	Cancer Cell	Challa-Malladi	Madhavi
20437868		Prognostic factors in follicular lymphoma: the importance of beta-2 microglobulin.	The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) is a useful tool for the prognostic assessment of follicular lymphoma but beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) was not incorporated in this index. We aimed to compare the predictive value of B2M, FLIPI and other prognostic factors not included in the FLIPI index for overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR), and time to treatment failure (TTF) in a nonselected follicular lymphoma series. Retrospective univariate and multivariate analysis of the prognostic value (for OS, CR, TTF) of B2M, FLIPI and other prognostic variables in follicular lymphoma was conducted in a cohort of follicular lymphoma patients between 1987 and 2007. One hundred and six patients were studied. In univariate analysis B2M and B symptoms were significantly associated with OS, and FLIPI only detected two risk levels. In multivariate analysis of OS only two significant variables were found: FLIPI and B2M. Multivariate analysis of CR showed that normal B2M, absence of a bulky mass, uninvolved bone marrow, and chemotherapy with rituximab were significant predictors of CR. FLIPI (three levels), B2M, bone marrow infiltration, and chemotherapy with rituximab were significantly associated with TTF. We found a high predictive value of B2M for OS, CR, and TTF. B2M and FLIPI were the most important variables to predict OS. However, in our series FLIPI differentiated only between two mortality risk levels.	2010	05	14	Tumori	Cánovas	Araceli
20629733	10.1111/j.1600-0625.2010.01138.x	A novel xenograft model of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.	Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are characterized by accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. Early disease resembles benign skin disorders but during disease progression cutaneous tumors develop, and eventually the malignant T cells can spread to lymph nodes and internal organs. However, because of the lack of suitable animal models, little is known about the mechanisms driving CTCL development and progression in vivo. Here, we describe a novel xenograft model of tumor stage CTCL, where malignant T cells (MyLa2059) are transplanted to NOD/SCID-B2m(-/-) (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) B2m(tm1Unc) /J) mice. Subcutaneous transplantation of the malignant T cells led to rapid tumor formation in 43 of 48 transplantations, whereas transplantation of non-malignant T cells isolated from the same donor did not result in tumor development. Importantly, the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in mice treated with vorinostat when compared to mice treated with vehicle. Furthermore, in most mice the tumors displayed subcutaneous and/or lymphatic dissemination. Histological, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses confirmed that both tumors at the inoculation site, as well as distant subcutaneous and lymphatic tumors, originated from the transplanted malignant T cells. In conclusion, we describe a novel mouse model of tumor stage CTCL for future studies of disease dissemination and preclinical evaluations of new therapeutic strategies.	2011	04	19	Exp Dermatol	Krejsgaard	Thorbjørn
19265139	10.4049/jimmunol.0802316	Class I HLA folding and antigen presentation in beta 2-microglobulin-defective Daudi cells.	To present virus and tumor Ags, HLA class I molecules undergo a complex multistep assembly involving discrete but transient folding intermediates. The most extensive folding abnormalities occur in cells lacking the class I L chain subunit, called beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m). Herein, this issue was investigated taking advantage of eight conformational murine mAbs (including the prototypic W6/32 mAb) to mapped H chain epitopes of class I molecules, four human mAbs to class I alloantigens, as well as radioimmunoprecipitation, in vitro assembly, pulse-chase, flow cytometry, and peptide-pulse/ELISPOT experiments. We show that endogenous (HLA-A1, -A66, and -B58) as well as transfected (HLA-A2) heavy chains in beta(2)m-defective Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells are capable of being expressed on the cell surface, although at low levels, and exclusively as immature glycoforms. In addition, HLA-A2 is: 1) partially folded at crucial interfaces with beta(2)m, peptide Ag, and CD8; 2) receptive to exogenous peptide; and 3) capable of presenting exogenous peptide epitopes (from virus and tumor Ags) to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (bulk populations as well as clones) educated in a beta(2)m-positive environment. These experiments demonstrate a precursor-product relationship between novel HLA class I folding intermediates, and define a stepwise mechanism whereby distinct interfaces of the class I H chain undergo successive, ligand-induced folding adjustments in vitro as well as in vivo. Due to this unprecedented class I plasticity, Daudi is the first human cell line in which folding and function of class I HLA molecules are observed in the absence of beta(2)m. These findings bear potential implications for tumor immunotherapy.	2009	05	08	J Immunol	Martayan	Aline
19286254	10.1016/j.leukres.2009.02.015	Prognostic [corrected] significance of angiogenic/lymphangiogenic, anti-apoptotic, inflammatory and viral factors in 88 cases with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and review of the literature.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of Non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL). The outcome of these patients shows a wide variation. We evaluated the effect of six biologic parameters including Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), Survivin, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C (VEGF-C), Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and clinical parameters. A follow up study was conducted and 88 cases with DLBCL were included in the study. The data of 72 patients were eligible for the survival analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect these parameters. The ratio of positive cases for Cox-2, VEGF-A, Survivin, VEGF-C, EBV, TSP-1 were 71.6%, 64.8%, 60.2%, 36.4%, 21.6%, 14.8%, respectively. Survivin (+) cases showed higher LDH levels and VEGF-A (+) cases showed higher beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) levels compared with (-) cases. Mean survival rates were found to be significantly shorter in cases expressing VEGF-A, VEGF-C, EBV and Survivin than cases not expressing these. EBV expression (HR: 3.78; 95%CI: 1.47-9.74; p=0.006), VEGF-C expression (HR: 3.22; 95%CI: 1.07-9.68; p=0.037) and extranodal involvement (HR: 3.02; 95%CI: 1.01-8.97; p=0.047) were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis according to the Cox regression analysis. Lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C) and EBV related viral lymphomagenesis have been found to be related with prognosis in DLBCL patients.	2009	11	23	Leuk Res	Paydas	Semra
19874554	10.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02313.x	Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in children with Hodgkin's lymphoma.	The study was to determine clinical utility of serum soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2Ralpha), beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as markers of diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to therapy in childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The markers were measured prospectively before treatment and in complete remission (CR) during and after therapy in 30 children with HL (F/M:19/11; median age: 11.3 years) and once in 50 healthy children (F/M: 24/26; median age: 8.7 years). Median pretreatment levels of all analysed markers were significantly higher than in healthy controls. Increased pretreatment sIL-2Ralpha, LDH and ESR correlated with bulky disease; sIL-2Ralpha, beta(2)-M and ESR with presence of B symptoms and sIL-2Ralpha and LDH with advanced HL stages. There was a correlation between sIL-2Ralpha and LDH and between beta(2)-M and ESR. The levels and rates of elevated markers reflected well the response to chemotherapy, decreasing significantly when patients achieved CR and further on with therapy continuation. Since all patients survived thus the markers' value to predict the outcome was not established. Serum sIL-2Ralpha, beta(2)-M, LDH and ESR may act as markers for diagnostics and used in monitoring of therapy effectiveness in childhood HL. The markers were also increased in subgroups of patients with unfavourable clinical features; however, small sample size of the study did not allow to draw conclusion on their prognostic roles. We were also not able to establish the influence of markers on event free survival and overall survival because all children survived independent of initial clinical characteristics and pretreatment levels of sIL-2Ralpha, beta(2)-M, LDH and ESR.	2009	11	17	Scand J Immunol	Bien	E
18688847	10.1002/ijc.23772	Human acute leukemia cells injected in NOD/LtSz-scid/IL-2Rgamma null mice generate a faster and more efficient disease compared to other NOD/scid-related strains.	Transplantation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) primary cells and cell lines in different strains of immunodeficient mice has led to preclinical models extensively used to investigate acute leukemia stem cells, biology and drug sensitivity. We studied the engraftment kinetics of AML and ALL cell lines and primary cells in 3 strains of NOD.CB17-Prkdc(scid) (NOD/scid, NS)-related mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)B2m(tm1Unc)/J, abbreviated NOD/scid/beta2 null, NSB; and NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjll)/SzJ, abbreviated NOD/scid/IL-2Rgamma null, NSG). The engraftment of human malignant cells was investigated by means of clinicopathological criteria, flow cytometry, PCR and immunohistochemistry. In NSG mice, we observed a significantly faster development of leukemia-related symptoms and a higher percentage of leukemia cells in the blood, in the marrow and in the spleen. The leukemia-related angiogenic switch (measured as the number of circulating endothelial cells and progenitors) was faster in NSG compared to NS and NSB mice. These models will be instrumental to studies on leukemia-initiating stem cells, leukemia biology, preclinical treatment studies, and to obtain patient-specific preclinical models to design and investigate patient-tailored therapies.	2008	09	16	Int J Cancer	Agliano	Alice
17325847	10.1080/10428190601001904	An analysis of clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of single-agent thalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.	Given that the efficacy/safety of thalidomide for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma have not been well characterized in a randomized, controlled setting, an analysis of larger, single-agent trials was conducted. Nine trials met the following inclusion criteria: primary population of multiple myeloma; all patients relapsed or refractory; single-agent thalidomide; and sample size &gt; or =50. At median doses of 200 - 800 mg per day, the pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 28.2% (95% CI: 22.6 - 33.7%), including a complete response (CR) rate of 1.6% (95% CI: 0.3 - 2.9%) and partial response rate of 26.0% (95% CI: 20.1 - 32.0%). Response was typically based on M-protein reduction alone. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) incidence varied from 12 - 44%, possibly impacted by the short median follow-up (9 - 29 months). Pooled venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence was 2.7% (95% CI: 1.1 - 4.3%) and discontinuation due to intolerance (DDI) rate was 14.9% (95% CI: 12.0 - 17.7%). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and PN incidence were not pooled due to lack of reporting and trial heterogeneity. Prognostic factors identified included B2M (PFS) and advanced age (PFS and OS). Overall, thalidomide demonstrated an ORR approaching 30%, with low CR rate of 1.6% and VTE and DDI incidences of 3% and 15%, respectively.	2007	04	20	Leuk Lymphoma	Prince	H Miles
17499801	10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.007	Targeting beta2-microglobulin mediated signaling as a novel therapeutic approach for human renal cell carcinoma.	We previously reported that the biological functions of beta2-microglobulin include antigen presentation and oncogenic activity. In the current study we investigated the direct role of beta2-microglobulin in the regulation of human renal cell carcinoma cell growth and the possible apoptotic inducing effect of blocking the beta2-microglobulin signaling pathway using an anti-beta2-microglobulin neutralizing antibody. We examined the effects of recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein and anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody on renal cell carcinoma cell growth and apoptosis in vitro. To seek a molecular understanding of anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody induced apoptosis we analyzed alterations in the growth and survival signaling components in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-jun N-terminal kinase mediated pathways using corresponding kinase inhibitors in SN12C cells. Recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein increased the growth of the 3 human renal cell carcinoma cell lines SN12C, Caki-1 and ACHN in a dose and time dependent manner. Treatment of SN12C, Caki-1 and ACHN cells with an anti-beta2-microglobulin polyclonal antibody strongly suppressed the growth of these cells in vitro, also in a dose and time dependent manner. The addition of recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein or anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody increased or decreased, respectively, the anchorage independent growth of SN12C cells. The recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein accelerated cell growth via activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and induced the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter. However, treatment with anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody induced cell death by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and activating c-jun N-terminal kinase, resulting in the induction of phosphorylation of B-cell lymphoma 2 and decreased phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter, leading to apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that beta2-microglobulin has an important role in regulating the growth and survival of renal cell carcinoma cells and anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody offers a potential novel therapy for the treatment of human renal cell carcinoma.	2007	07	17	J Urol	Nomura	Takeo
18024396	10.3324/haematol.11502	Prognostic relevance of serum beta2 microglobulin in patients with follicular lymphoma treated with anthracycline-containing regimens. A GISL study.	Although serum beta2 microglobulin (beta2 M) is an easy parameter to measure, and over-expressed in a large number of lymphoproliferative diseases, its prognostic value has been largely underestimated. The present study examined the influence of beta2M levels on overall survival (OS) of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). The prognostic role of beta2M was evaluated in 236 patients with FL identified from the databases of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dei Linfomi (GISL) and treated with anthracycline-based regimens from 1993 to 2003. Elevated serum beta2M levels were found in 82 patients (35%). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, elevated beta2M levels were associated with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p=0.021), age (p=0.029), and number of involved nodal areas (p&lt;0.001). The percentage of elevated beta2M levels increased progressively with increasing FLIPI scores (17%, 38%, and 63% in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively). Five-year OS was 61% (95% CI, 47-73%) and 89% (95% CI, 82-93%) for patients with elevated vs normal beta2M levels respectively (p&lt;0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that beta2M level had an independent and stable prognostic value (HR=3.0; 95%CI, 1.6-5.7). In a multivariate analysis the impact of beta2M level on survival was independent of FLIPI score, with a HR of 2.94 (95% CI, 1.54-5.62). Our results demonstrate that in patients treated in the pre-rituximabera, beta2M level was an independent prognostic marker in addition to FLIPI score. We thus suggest that beta2M be routinely assessed and tested in future prognostic studies of FL patients treated with combination chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents.	2007	12	19	Haematologica	Federico	Massimo
16085553	10.1080/10428190500102845	Malignant pleural effusion of multiple myeloma: prognostic factors and outcome.	Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in multiple myeloma (MM) is rare. Approximately 80 cases have been reported. To delineate optimal treatment and prognostic variables in these patients, we reviewed 11 MM patients with MPE. MPE developed at median of 12 months from diagnosis of MM. All the patients had high-risk disease based on complex karyotypic abnormalities including deletions of chromosome-13 (n=9), elevated beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) (n=9), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (n=8), high plasma cell labeling index (n=5) or high LDH (n=5). A significant increase in B2M, LDH, and CRP was observed at the onset of MPE. The initial diagnosis of MPE was based on positive cytology (n=9), pleural fluid cIg/DNA (n=9) or pleural fluid cytogenetics (n=4). Pleural tissue infiltration was found on pleural biopsy and autopsy in one patient each. Systemic chemotherapy comprising dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin (DCEP) (n=7) and pleurodesis (n=7) were effective in resolving MPE but survival was short. High dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell support for MPE in six patients conferred no clear survival advantage. These patients died at median of four months from onset of MPE. Patients with bone marrow complex karyotypic abnormalities including deletion-13 (n=9) had a shorter (median--18 months) overall survival compared to patients with normal cytogenetics (median--38 months). MPE in patients with MM is often associated with high-risk disease including deletion 13 chromosomal abnormality and heralds a poor prognosis despite aggressive local and systemic treatment.	2006	04	24	Leuk Lymphoma	Kamble	R
12454016	10.1074/jbc.M208381200	A dominant negative mutant beta 2-microglobulin blocks the extracellular folding of a major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain.	The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC1) molecule plays a crucial role in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. beta 2-Microglobulin (beta 2m) has been demonstrated to be both a structural component of the MHC1 complex and a chaperone-like molecule for MHC1 folding. beta 2m binding to an isolated alpha 3 domain of MHC1 heavy chain at micromolar concentrations has been shown to accurately model the biochemistry and thermodynamics of beta 2m-driven MHC1 folding. These results suggested a model in which the chaperone-like role of beta 2m is dependent on initial binding to the alpha 3 domain interface of MHC1 with beta 2m. Such a model predicts that a mutant beta 2m molecule with an intact MHC1 alpha 3 domain interaction but a defective MHC1 alpha 1 alpha 2 domain interaction would block beta2m-driven folding of MHC1. In this study we generated such a beta 2m mutant and demonstrated that it blocks MHC1 folding by normal beta 2m at the expected micromolar concentrations. Our data support an initial interaction of beta 2m with the MHC1 alpha 3 domain in MHC1 folding. In addition, the dominant negative mutant beta 2m can block T-cell functional responses to antigenic peptide and MHC1.	2003	04	22	J Biol Chem	Hill	Dawn M
12471623	10.1002/ijc.10824	Beta2-microglobulin aberrations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the testis and the central nervous system.	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules are expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells and present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T cells, thereby playing an important role in initiating the cellular anti-tumor immune response. We previously reported that loss of HLA class I expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the central nervous system (CNS) and the testis is a common event. Loss of expression and mutations of the light chain of the HLA class I molecule, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) have been described in a variety of human tumors and cell lines. In our study, we screened 15 DLBCL cases with a combined loss of HLA class I and beta(2)m expression for mutations in the latter gene by direct sequencing. Frame shift mutations in repetitive sequences within the beta(2)m gene leading to loss of functional beta(2)m were detected in 2 cases. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for chromosome 15 exhibited loss of the remaining copy of the beta(2)m gene in both cases but also hemizygous deletions and monosomies in 6 additional cases. Since similar mutations in the beta(2)m gene have been associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), we used 8 markers to study MSI involvement in DLBCL. Low MSI was more frequent (33%) as compared to nodal DLBCL (n=15) but did not correlate with the beta(2)m mutations. Our data indicate that multiple mechanisms lead to downregulation of beta(2)m and concomitant loss of HLA class I expression in DLBCL.	2003	01	21	Int J Cancer	Jordanova	Ekaterina S
12759931	10.1002/gcc.10214	Evidence for whole chromosome 6 loss and duplication of the remaining chromosome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	HLA class I molecules serve the essential immunological function of presenting antigen to CD8+ T lymphocytes. Tumor cells may present tumor-specific antigen to T cells via these molecules, but many tumors show a loss or down-regulation of HLA class I expression and this may serve as an immune escape mechanism. Using a microsatellite marker-based method, we have searched for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations at 3 genomic regions implicated in HLA class I expression in a cohort of 56 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples. The regions analyzed consisted of the HLA class I heavy chain genes located within the MHC genomic region on chromosome arm 6p, the HLA class I light chain (beta-2-microglobulin, B2M) gene on chromosome arm 15q, and the putative HLA modifier of methylation gene (MEMO1) located on chromosome arm 1q. Results revealed low frequencies of B2M (2/55) and MEMO1 (5/42) LOH but a high frequency of MHC LOH (19/56) that was usually associated with whole chromosome 6 loss (13/19). Cytogenetic data were available for 30 samples, including nine of those that exhibited apparent whole chromosome 6 loss. No cases of chromosome 6 monosomy were observed. We propose that whole chromosome 6 loss with reduplication of the remaining chromosome is common in ALL and that it is driven by the presence of tumor-inhibiting factors on chromosome arm 6p (the HLA loci) along with previously localized tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome arm 6q.	2003	07	28	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	McEvoy	Christopher R E
12401828	10.1136/jcp.55.11.865	A reliable method for total RNA extraction from frozen human bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis of acute leukaemia.	This report describes a newly developed method using Trizol LS reagent that can reliably extract high quality total RNA from frozen human leukaemic bone marrow samples. Extraction of total RNA from 71 frozen leukaemic bone marrow samples obtained at the time of diagnosis produced a median yield of 145 micro g/ml leukaemic bone marrow. Total RNA samples could be reverse transcribed into cDNA and used successfully in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of B2M transcripts in 68 of 71 cases. A multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that significant predictors of RNA yield were both sample volume (&lt; 1 ml v &gt; 1 ml; p = 0.003) and peripheral blood white cell count (&lt; 5 x 10(9) v &gt;or= 5 x 10(9) white blood cells/litre; p = 0.011). The percentage of blasts present, leukaemia subtype, and sample storage period at -80 degrees C (up to 945 days) were not predictors of total RNA yield. This method of total RNA extraction should be of interest to diagnostic and research staff using frozen bone marrow samples for molecular analyses. Similarly, the lack of association between sample storage period at -80 degrees C and total RNA yield should be of interest to the administrators of tumour banks housing frozen bone marrow samples.	2002	12	17	J Clin Pathol	Barbaric	D
11712809		Beta-2-microglobulin levels in patients with extranodal B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type: a retrospective analysis.	Serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) have been reported as a predictor of clinical outcome, prognosis and tumor burden in patients with various types of lymphomas. In case of lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type, no clear data exist to define the role of B2M in terms of staging or prognosis. In a retrospective analysis we investigated the serum B2M-levels in patients suffering from histologically verified MALT-type lymphoma in correlation to stage and response to treatment. All patients admitted to our institution since 1996 with a diagnosis of MALT-type lymphoma were retrospectively evaluated for staging procedures and measurements of serum B2M levels. Patients with a staging work-up including otorhinolaryngologic evaluation, gastroscopy with multiple biopsies, endosonography of the upper GI-tract, enteroclysis, colonoscopy, CT of thorax and abdomen and bone marrow biopsy were analysed, while staging was performed according to the Ann Arbor system as modified by Musshoff. In addition, only patients with histologic samples amenable to re-assessment by a reference pathologist were included. A total of 68 patients with a diagnosis of MALT-type lymphoma were identified from our records. However, only in 32 patients exact staging according to our inclusion criteria had been performed and serum B2M-levels prior to the initiation of therapy were available in all these patients. Twenty-five patients; suffered from gastric lymphoma, while the remaining 7 patients had extragastric manifestations. In total, 13 out of 32 patients presented with stage I disease, 17 patients were rated as stage II and 2 patients suffered from stage III disease. Nineteen patients had elevated B2M-levels prior to therapy: 6 patients were rated as stage 1, II had stage II and two had stage III disease. Five patients still had elevated B2M-levels following treatment despite radiologically and histologically verified complete remission. In this series, no correlation between serum B2M levels, tumor burden and clinical outcome was apparent in patients with MALT-type lymphomas. While the number of patients with disseminated disease was small we could not demonstrate a difference for B2M-levels between stage I and stage II. While we cannot rule out that B2M might be different in patients with stage I/II disease as compared to more advanced disease, further investigations are necessary to determine the role of this marker in patients with MALT-type lymphoma.	2001	12	10	Anticancer Res	Penz	M Z
12004151		[Renal function in children after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)].	The aim of the study was to evaluate the renal function (on the basis of serum: cystatin C, creatinine, beta2-microglobulin(B2M) levels, creatinine and cystatin C clearance, and urine osmolality) in 37 children with ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) after completing intensive treatment (9 in course of maintenance therapy), depending on nephrotoxic antibiotics use (&lt;/=3 times vs &gt; 3 times) and methotrexate dose (1.0 g/m2 vs 5g/m2). The control group was formed by 15 healthy children. 1) Serum cystatin C, creatinine, beta2-microglobulin levels creatinine and cystatin C clearance, and urine osmolality were similar in the analysed and control groups. 2) We did not find any differences between the analyzed parameters in the groups of children: a) in maintenance therapy and after the end of the therapy, b) received methotrexate in the dose of 5.0 g/m2 vs 1.0 g/m2, c) not treated children and treated &lt;/= 3 times and gt; 3 times with nephrotoxic antibiotics.

The effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) exposures to human health has been widely debated. Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.	2000	06	09	Radiat Res	Morehouse	C A
9789607	10.1023/a:1008418727472	Peripheral T-cell lymphomas: initial features, natural history, and prognostic factors in a series of 174 patients diagnosed according to the R.E.A.L. Classification.	Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) account for about 10% of all lymphomas in Western countries. The aim of the present study is to analyze the initial characteristics and prognostic factors in a large series of PTCL patients. 174 patients (105 male/69 female; median age 61 years) were diagnosed with PTCL according to the R.E.A.L. Classification in nine Spanish institutions between 1985 and 1996. Cutaneous lymphomas and T-cell chronic lymphocytic/prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of the main initial variables. The distribution according to histology subgroup was: PTCL unspecified, 95 cases (54.4%); anaplastic large-cell Ki-l-positive (ALCL), 30 cases (17%); angioimmunoblastic T cell, 22 cases (13%); angiocentric, 14 cases (8%); intestinal T cell, 12 cases (7%), and hepatosplenic gamma delta T cell, one case (0.6%). As compared to the other types, ALCL presented more frequently in ambulatory performance status, without extranodal involvement, in early stage, normal serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) level and low-risk international prognostic index (IPI). Most patients were treated with adriamycin-containing regimens. The overall CR rate was 49% (69% for ALCL vs. 45% for other PTCL; P &lt; 0.02). The risk of relapse was 48% at four years. Median survival of the series was 22 months (65 months for ALCL vs. 20 months for other PTCL; P = 0.03), with a four-year probability of survival of 38% (95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 28-48). In the univariate analysis, in addition to the histology, older age, poor performance status, presence of B-symptoms, extranodal involvement, bone marrow infiltration, advanced Ann Arbor stage, high serum LDH, high serum B2M, and intermediate- or high-risk IPI were related to poor survival. In the multivariate analysis the histologic subgroup (ALCL vs. other PTCL) (P = 0.02; response rate (RR): 4.3), the presence of B-symptoms (P = 0.02, RR: 2.2), and the IPI (low vs. high) (P = 0.04, RR: 2) maintained independent predictive value. When the analysis was restricted to the unspecified subtype, only IPI had independent prognostic value (P = 0.003; RR: 3.5). PTCL have adverse prognostic features at diagnosis, respond poorly to therapy and have short survival, with no sustained remission. ALCL constitutes a subgroup which responds better to therapy and has a longer survival.	1999	02	12	Ann Oncol	López-Guillermo	A
9067691		Increased beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) is useful in the detection of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).	This study examines whether changes in beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) serum levels are useful in the early detection of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Serum B2M is monitored daily post-transplant at our center as a marker of change in lymphocyte activation. We identified 16 cases (16/1359; 1.2%) of PTLD from among 1359 kidney and kidney-pancreas transplants. Those with CNS lymphoma (two patients) and titer change only (one) were not included in this review. Thirteen patients had serum titer and clinical evidence of EBV activity; 12 of these patients had histological evidence of PTLD (lymph node 6, kidney 3, and generalized disease 3). Three patients died with disseminated PTLD infection. Nine are alive but only two have the original transplant kidney. All patients received quadruple immunosuppression for induction, and 11 were subsequently treated with OKT3 or ALG for rejection. The mean number of days of induction ALG therapy was 14.8 d (20 mg/kg/d). The mean number of days of OKT3 therapy for rejection was 14.4 d (5 mg/d). During rejection the highest mean creatinine level was 6.8 mg/dL, and the highest mean B2M level was 16.4. With PTLD, the highest mean creatinine level was 7.0 mg/dL and the highest mean B2M level was 32.3 mg/L. The difference in creatinine levels was not significant, but the difference in B2M levels was significant (p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that B2M levels are useful markers in differentiating rejection from PTLD.	1997	05	23	Clin Transplant	Sasaki	T M
8726404	10.3109/10428199209067605	Effects of alpha-interferon on serum beta-2-microglobulin.	Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) forms the small invariable light chain subunit of class I HLA antigens on the cell membrane of all nucleated cells. During the continuous turnover of the HLA molecules, B2M is shed from the cell membrane into blood. Lymphocytes are the main source of serum free B2M. Serum B2M concentration is increased in renal diseases, various malignant diseases and some inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. In lymphatic malignancies serum B2M has significant prognostic value. Interferons (IFNs) have the ability to enhance the expression of class I and II histocompatibility antigens. Accordingly, IFNs cause a rise in formation and release of B2M. Currently, treatment with IFN alpha is used in diseases, like multiple myeloma, where serum B2M measurements are used to assess tumor burden. We have measured serum B2M levels during IFN alpha treatment in patients with both multiple myeloma and chronic myeloproliferative diseases, and IFN alpha caused a significant increase in serum B2M. It can be concluded that use of IFN alpha abolishes the value of serum B2M as an indicator of disease activity.	1996	10	01	Leuk Lymphoma	Remes	K
8580834	10.3109/10428199509064927	Risk classification for large cell lymphoma using lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2 microglobulin, and thymidine kinase.	We have previously proposed a staging system for large cell lymphoma using the two serum markers beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). We recently tested this model in a different cohort of patients with large cell lymphoma and also examined the possible contribution of thymidine kinase (TK), a previously reported serologic prognostic factor. Using an inclusion criteria in the multivariate analysis for both forward and backward selection of p &lt; 0.15, only LDH, B2M, and TK were significant independent prognostic factors for both time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival. Inclusion of TK in the serologic model resulted in three significantly different risk groups for both TTF and survival. Corresponding endpoints at three years were: 1) good risk (no markers elevated, n = 43): 78%, 91%; 2) intermediate risk (1 or 2 markers elevated, n = 47): 41%, 36%; 3) poor risk (3 markers elevated, n = 11): 0%, 0%. This analysis extends the observation of the independent prognostic significance of B2M and LDH.

Eleven (50%) of 22 HIV-seropositive patients suffering from congenital coagulation defects and followed at the Hemophilia Center of Padua met the eligibility criteria for zidovudine (AZT) therapy. A 3-year clinical and laboratory follow up is described. Mean length of AZT treatment was 14.3 +/- 11 months. Three patients were enrolled at the latest stages (CDC stage IV) of HIV disease. They showed no clinical improvement after AZT administration and died with AIDS. One CDC stage III patient died from a high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) which suddenly developed 3 months after starting AZT. Seven patients began antiretroviral treatment when they were mild or asymptomatic for HIV infection (CDC stage II and III). None developed any sign of HIV disease progression on the basis of CDC criteria. Moreover, AZT administration induced an improvement of the humoral markers related to HIV disease, as CD4 T-lymphocyte count, serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) and, although only for few months, neopterin (Np) levels. A mild thrombocytopenia due to HIV infection was detected in 5 patients. In all cases AZT treatment was effective in increasing and/or normalizing the platelet count. Reduced daily dose AZT (600-500 mg/day) appeared to be well tolerated and of minimal toxicity as compared to the higher dose (1200 mg/day). In our study, the zidovudine-induced bone marrow suppression, namely severe anemia or pancytopenia, was the major side-effect limiting tolerance of the higher dose AZT.	1994	12	08	Haematologia (Budap)	Sartori	M T
1575009	10.1111/j.1600-0404.1992.tb04033.x	Cerebrospinal fluid beta-2-microglobulin in adult patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma: a useful marker in early diagnosis and monitoring of CNS-involvement.	Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from 18 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia or lymphoma in order to detect early central nervous system (CNS) involvement or relapse. Six had CNS-involvement documented by neurologic symptoms and tumor cells in the CSF. Their CSF-B2m-concentrations were significantly higher before intrathecal chemotherapy than in those without this complication (P less than 0.01). During therapy CSF-B2m levels fell rapidly to normal values on repeated measurements. The study demonstrates that serial determination of CSF-B2m alone may be a useful and sensitive marker of CNS-dissemination in acute leukemia and malignant lymphoma. Using the criteria of CSF-B2m greater than 160 nmol/l as a positive diagnostic test the sensitivity of the test was 100%, the specificity was 76%. The same values for the CSF/serum-ratio greater than 1 were 75% and 64%, respectively.	1992	06	04	Acta Neurol Scand	Hansen	P B
1627535	10.1111/j.1744-313x.1992.tb00053.x	Damage in B2m genes and DNA methylation of H-2 genes are involved in loss of expression of class I MHC products on the membrane of LR.4, a cell line derivative of the T-cell lymphoma L5178Y.	We have isolated an H-2 deficient cell line (LR.4) from the T-cell lymphoma L5178Y which grew without restrictions in the peritoneal cavity of different inbred strains of mice. The use of polyclonal anti-H-2 antiserum and complement indicated that LR.4 cells did not express class I determinants on the cell membrane. Southern blots of genomic DNA of LR.4 cells showed that B2m genes were severely damaged and that class I H-2 genes were extensively methylated. Consequently, LR.4 cells failed to transcribe mRNAs for both B2m and class I H-2 genes. On the other hand, specific immunity to LR.4 was demonstrated in C57BL/6J mice since, in subsequent challenges with either LR.4 or EL4.4, LR.4 did not grow, whereas EL4.4 grew and killed the mice. In C57BL/6J mice, rejection of LR.4 was accompanied by the production of cytotoxic antibodies. The immune response induced in C57BL/6J mice was determined by non-H-2 antigenic determinants in LR.4 cells.	1992	08	18	Eur J Immunogenet	Nava	G
2194155	10.3109/00313029009061421	Cerebrospinal fluid B2-microglobulin levels in meningeal involvement by malignancy.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum B2-microglobulin (B2m) levels were measured prospectively in 63 patients with hematological malignancies and 14 patients with solid tumours to evaluate the correlation between elevated levels and malignant infiltration of meninges. Serial CSF B2-m levels were also measured in 18 patients who received prophylactic intrathecal cytotoxic treatment. CSF B2-m levels were significantly higher in patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement than in those without (p less than 0.001). A CSF B2-m level greater than 1.80 mg/L was closely associated with CNS disease (specificity 96%, sensitivity 76%) and CNS infiltration was also likely when the CSF B2-m level exceeded a simultaneously drawn serum level (specificity 98%, sensitivity 46%). Intrathecal methotrexate prophylaxis resulted in a consistent and significant rise in CSF B2-m levels with an average increase of 96% during a course of intrathecal injections. These results suggest that CSF B2-m levels may not be helpful for predicting early CNS relapse in these patients. However the CSF B2-m level and the corresponding serum B2-m level is a useful adjunct to the cytological diagnosis of CNS involvement by malignancy at presentation. Its value in predicting early CNS relapse and documenting response to CNS treatment requires further clarification.	1990	08	08	Pathology	Jeffery	G M
2450918		Specific associations of fluorescent beta-2-microglobulin with cell surfaces. The affinity of different H-2 and HLA antigens for beta-2-microglobulin.	We prepared single-labeled FITC derivatives of beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) and examined their interactions with class I MHC Ag H chains on living cells. Human b2m was reacted with FITC under mild conditions and separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography into three peaks containing single labeled derivatives of b2m peaks A, B, and C, and a peak containing the unmodified protein. The three fluorescent derivatives labeled the surfaces of cells bearing class I MHC Ag. The labeling was specific for class I MHC Ag as indicated by failure to label cells in the presence of excess unlabeled b2m and failure to label the HLA-negative cell lines Daudi and 721.221. Mouse cells labeled with fluorescent human b2m were recognized by mAb to the class I MHC Ag and by virus-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suggesting that labeling with the fluorescent b2m does not significantly alter the structure of class I MHC Ag or impair their ability to present viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We determined the kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters for the fluorescent b2m derivatives associating with the class I H chains of mouse and human cells. Peaks B and C exhibited biphasic binding to the mouse lymphoma cells EL-4(G-CSA-) (Kd1 = 1 x 10(-9) M; K2 = 1.5 to 3.0 x 10(-8) M whereas peak A bound to a small number of low affinity binding sites. In contrast to the biphasic binding observed with EL-4(G-CSA-), only monophasic binding was observed for peak C binding to RDM4 cells. Biphasic binding was also observed with the human B cell line LCL 721. Analysis of a series of LCL 721 class I MHC loss mutants and gene transferents revealed that the heterogeneity in binding is due to differences in the affinity of different class I encoded H chains for b2m.	1988	04	26	J Immunol	Hochman	J H

The electrophoretically fast moving form of beta-2-microglobulin (alpha-B2m) was shown by crossed immunoelectrophoresis to be produced in vitro after incubation at room temperature and was not present in freshly drawn sera. A radioisotopic assay was developed to measure this conversion to alpha-B2m in sera from 14 healthy individuals and from 208 patients with benign and malignant disease. The activity was present in all the sera tested and the levels were significantly higher in sera from patients with small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and in childhood lymphomas when compared to the level in normal sera.	1988	12	22	Clin Chim Acta	Forbes	M A
3141196	10.1016/0277-5379(88)90218-0	Alteration of beta-2-microglobulin level in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases after a high dose of alpha-2-recombinant interferon.	A group of 10 patients with malignant lymphoproliferative diseases resistant to any standard therapeutical modalities were treated with a high dose of alpha-2-recombinant interferon (alpha-2-rIF). Alpha-2-rIF was administered at a total dose of 120 x 10(6) IU in a continuous infusion during 48 h. Two cycles of alpha-2-rIF immunotherapy were employed with an interval of 1 month in between each. Serum and urinary beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were examined prior to alpha-2-rIF application and on days 2, 4, 6 afterwards. Alpha-2-rIF treatment induced an increase in serum B2M as noted on day 2 followed by a decline to below the normal range. The initial increased value was significantly higher as compared to either the pretreatment value or the normal physiological range. The reduced B2M serum level was protracted and lasted until the second cycle of treatment. Similar but not so great changes in B2M serum values were noted during the second application of alpha-2-rIF. The changes of B2M level in the urine, although less convincing, mimic those observed in the serum. The present results confirmed the biological activity of alpha-2-rIF in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases.	1988	12	14	Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol	Opat	P
3285553		Serum beta 2-microglobulin in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders.	Beta 2-microglobulin (B2m) was measured on serum samples in 274 patients with acute and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (85 non-Hodgkin lymphomas-NHL, 30 Hodgkin lymphomas-HL, 34 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias-B-CLL, 8 Waldenström macroglobulinemias-WM, 76 multiple myelomas-MM, 31 acute lymphoblastic leukemias-ALL, 10 hairy cell leukemias-HCL). Two hundred and four patients were studied at the time of diagnosis, and results were correlated to clinical stage, and histologic subtype in NHL, immunoglobulin type in MM, and immunologic phenotype in ALL. Moreover, B2m was tested during and after chemo- and/or radiotherapy, and results were correlated to response, progression or relapse. Elevated pretreatment B2m values were found in widespread forms of NHL and HL, in patients with B symptoms and in the unfavorable histologic subgroups of NHL. Rapid falls in levels followed therapy institution. In B-CLL and in MM a close relationship between B2m and cell mass was found. A significant B2m level reduction followed treatment, whereas its increase could detect a relapse. In ALL, serum B2m was only slightly above the normal range. B2m seems to reflect the total burden of malignant cells mainly in MM and B-CLL; in other lymphoproliferative disorders it provides less prognostic information.	1988	06	23	Tumori	Melillo	L
11894933	10.1002/j.1460-2075.1983.tb01412.x	The beta2-microglobulin mRNA in human Daudi cells has a mutated initiation codon but is still inducible by interferon.	The human Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi does not synthesize beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and lacks the cell surface histocompatibility antigens. The cells, however, contain RNA hybridizing to a cloned human beta2m cDNA probe. cDNA from this Daudi beta2m RNA, was cloned and sequenced. By comparison with cDNA prepared from Ramos cells, which synthesized microglobulin, we determined the sequence of the 20 amino acid long leader peptide of pre-beta2m and show that in Daudi cells the initiator ATG has been mutated to ATC. Although Daudi beta2m RNA cannot be translated, interferon induces the beta2m RNA in Daudi cells as well as in normal human cells.	2002	04	08	EMBO J	Rosa	F

In order to discriminate between benign and malignant effusions, the value of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha 1-acidglycoprotein (AGP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), phosphohexose isomerase (PHI), and beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) has been estimated in serous effusions in a group of 106 patients, 30 with a malignant and 76 with a benign effusion. Mean CEA and AGP levels in malignant effusions were significantly higher than in benign effusions; no significant differences of mean PHI, AFP and B2M levels of benign and malignant effusions were found. CEA level estimations were useful for confirming malignancy in 27% of malignant effusions but in only 7.5% of all effusions, and AGP and PHI for excluding it in 37.5 and 36.0% of all effusions, respectively. With the combination of CEA with AGP or PHI, a correct diagnosis was achieved in only 45 and 44% of all effusions, respectively. The combination of AFP or B2M with CEA, AGP or PHI did not improve the discriminative value for differentiating malignant and benign effusions.	1982	12	03	Cancer	Martinez-Vea	A
6185038		Beta-2 microglobulin--an immunogenetic marker of inflammatory and malignant origin.	Major contributions have been made in the last few years to the knowledge of the structure, fate and cellular origin of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M); but the question of its function still remains unclear. The concept of B2M being simply a marker of renal physiology seems less satisfactory when reference is made to its relationship to the immunogenetic system. Although assay of B2M cannot be considered as a specific diagnostic tool, it still may be regarded as a useful parameter in monitoring inflammatory, malignant, and auto-immune disease activity.	1983	02	25	Ann Clin Lab Sci	Forman	D T

Serum levels were high in all cases, excepting for ALL which presented normal values in 81% of the patients. The follow-up of the microprotein was carried out in 17 patients with acute leukaemias. The data obtained seem to suggest that subjects with high serum levels of B2M at the beginning of the disease do not respond favourably to chemotherapy.	1980	07	12	Biomedicine	Schena	F P
7212634		The identification of testis-organizing H-Y antigen of man as hydrophobic polymers of a M.W. 18,000 subunit.	Mammalian testicular organogenesis initiated by male specific but ubiquitously expressed H-Y antigen can serve as the model of all other organogenesis. However, in order to understand the precise organizational role this plasma membrane antigen plays, it is essential to characterize H-Y antigen as a distinct molecular entity which would be extremely difficult if we have to deal directly with native H-Y antigen residing on the plasma membrane. Fortunately, we have previously found that in the mutational absence of H-Y antigen's proposed anchorage site, B2m (-), HLA (-) Daudi human male Burkitt lymphoma cells are incapable of stably maintaining H-Y antigen on their plasma membrane. B2m (-), HLA (-) Daudi human male Burkitt lymphoma cells excreted a group of several proteins that shared the three distinctive characteristics in common; their extreme hydrophobicity, their tendency beyond saturation to form irreversibly water insoluble aggregates by extensive interchain disulfide bridges, and their conspicuously slower turn over rates compared to other Daudi excreted proteins. After disruption of disulfide bridges, proteins of this group were resolved into at least seven distinct subunits of different molecular weights. M.W. 18,000 subunit of testis-organizing H-Y antigen was the smallest of the above. At the saturation, 0.7 to 0.9 microgram/ml of solubilized H-Y antigen uniformly assumed the form of very large aggregates of M.W. greater than 280,000. In more dilute solutions, however, the existence in much smaller trimeric and tetrameric forms of H-Y antigen was indicated. As these irreversibly water insoluble precipitates still retained H-Y antigenic determinants, they can be used in the future for the purification of H-Y antibody. When bound specifically to H-Y receptor sites residing on the plasma membrane of BFO cells, polymeric Daudi H-Y antigen apparently underwent the depolymerization process, thus, yielding the monomeric form of M.W. 18,000. It is likely that these six or more Daudi excreted proteins that shared the three distinct characteristics with testis-organizing H-Y antigen are also involved in various specific organogenesis.	1981	05	13	Ann Endocrinol (Paris)	Ohno	S
82455		Serial measurement of beta2 microglobulin, acute phase reactant proteins and the ESR in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.	Long-term observation of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas indicates they can be sub-divided into two groups with respect to changes in the plasma proteins. The first group has acute phase reactant proteins raised during active disease and sometimes a raised B2m, whilst in remission the protein profile is normal. The second group is typified by a chronic elevation of B2m and ESR but has normal C-RP levels. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia usually has a raised B2 m level and normal acute phase proteins, a subset with low B2 m is described.	1979	02	12	Biomedicine	Cooper	E H
15154230		[Immunologic phenomena in guinea pigs injected with homologous ganglia extracts].	Immunological modifications in guinea pigs injected with homologous lymph node extracts. In studies carried out in patients with lymphomas an accentuation of the B2M-globulin line was observed; occasionally paraproteins and isoantibodies were detected. For this reason the authors decided to find out whether the injection of homologous lymph node extracts in guinea pigs would produce serum, immunological and histological modifications comparable to the ones observed in the human being. A total of 100 guinea pigs were divided into 4 groups. Group 1, 50 untrated control animals; Group 2, 10 animals injected with complete Freunds adjuvant every 10 days, for 3 times, and sacrificed 7 days after the last injection; Group 3, 10 animals injected with the antigen prepared with the lymph nodes from normal guinea pigs, in the same way as the preceding group; Group 4, 30 animals injected with the same antigens emulsionated with the adjuvant, again by the same method as the 2 preceding groups. The antigen was prepared with the lymph nodes from normal guinea pigs. The cells were ""ultrasonicated"" and lyophilized; the lipids were extracted with chloroform. The extract thus obtained contained an average of 2 mg/ml of total proteins. A microimmunoelectrophoretic study (MIE) against rabbit immuno serum for guinea pigs anti-serum proteins, showed that it was contaminated with various serum proteins (fig. 1, A). In the 3 injected groups, most of the guinea pigs showed a 10% decrease in serum protein (Table). Using MIE there was a re-enforcement of the B2M-globulin precipitation line (IgM), in all the animals of groups 2 and 4, as compared to the groups 1 and 3 (Table and figure 1. B and C). Using microdiffusion in agar, the serum of 6% of the guinea pigs of group 4 gave precipitation lines with the homologous antigen (Table, figure 1, D). Using passive hemagglutination, between 30 and 40% of the serum of the animals of all 4 groups gave positive results with the same antigen, with a low titer (1/40). Using complement fixation, positive results were obtained with the lymph node antigen in 10% and 20% of the animals of groups 3 and 4 respectively: from 25 to 50% fixation with a titer of 1/10 (Table). Using immunofluorescence, positive images in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (from improntas of normal guinea pigs lymph nodes) were obtained only in the labeled gamma-globulin (IgG) of the animals of group 4 (Table and figure 2, C). Histological study of the lymph nodes of guinea pigs from groups 2 and 4 showed hyperplasia of the reticular tissue with apparent decrease in the size of the follicles. In some of the lymph nodes of the animals of group 4, giant cells were observed (Fig. 2, B), pironinophilic. In the group 3 hypertrophy of the lymphoid follicles was observed (fig. 2, A). Non-specific modifications of the serum proteins, similar to the ones observed in patients with lymphomas were detected in some of the animals belonging to groups 2 and 3 in a greater number of animals in group 4. Circulating isoantibodies could be compared to those detected in 2 cases of lymphosarcoma. In spite of definite histological alterations of the lymphatic organs, these cannot be compared with the alterations detected in the human being.	2004	09	07	Medicina (B Aires)	Bachmann	A E
34753803	10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-21-0208	MALT1 Is a Targetable Driver of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Claudin-Low, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	MALT1 is the effector protein of the CARMA/Bcl10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, a multiprotein complex that drives pro-inflammatory signaling pathways downstream of a diverse set of receptors. Although CBM activity is best known for its role in immune cells, emerging evidence suggests that it plays a key role in the pathogenesis of solid tumors, where it can be activated by selected G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of GPCRs implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis, specifically the receptors for Angiotensin II and thrombin (AT1R and PAR1), drove a strong epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in breast cancer cells that is characteristic of claudin-low, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In concert, MALT1 was activated in these cells and contributed to the dramatic EMT phenotypic changes through regulation of master EMT transcription factors including Snail and ZEB1. Importantly, blocking MALT1 signaling, through either siRNA-mediated depletion of MALT1 protein or pharmacologic inhibition of its activity, was effective at partially reversing the molecular and phenotypic indicators of EMT. Treatment of mice with mepazine, a pharmacologic MALT1 inhibitor, reduced growth of PAR1+, MDA-MB-231 xenografts and had an even more dramatic effect in reducing the burden of metastatic disease. These findings highlight MALT1 as an attractive therapeutic target for claudin-low TNBCs harboring overexpression of one or more selected GPCRs. This study nominates a GPCR/MALT1 signaling axis as a pathway that can be pharmaceutically targeted to abrogate EMT and metastatic progression in TNBC, an aggressive form of breast cancer that currently lacks targeted therapies.	2022	04	27	Mol Cancer Res	Lee	Jia-Ying Lloyd
34783281	10.1080/10428194.2021.1999444	Targeting MALT1 for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has an aggressive course and is associated with poor prognosis in the relapsed or refractory setting. ABC-DLBCL is characterized by chronic active signaling of NF-κB, which is dependent on the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. MALT1 is a key effector of the CBM complex and activates canonical NF-κB and AP-1 among other transcription factors <i>via</i> distinct protease and scaffold functions. There is therefore growing interest in therapeutic targeting of MALT1 for B-cell malignancies. Here, we review recent advances in therapeutic targeting of MALT1 for ABC-DLBCL. Covalent and allosteric MALT1 protease inhibitors have been developed which inhibit growth of ABC-DLBCL in preclinical models, and two clinical MALT1 protease inhibitors are being developed in phase I clinical trials. Importantly, these compounds can overcome resistance to BTK inhibitors in preclinical models. Alternative compounds blocking the scaffold effect of MALT1 are also in early preclinical development. Blockade of MALT1 protease activity may have important implications for anti-lymphoma immunity by increasing immunogenicity of ABC-DLBCL cells and also by potentiating anti-lymphoma activity of other immune cells in the lymphoma microenvironment. Together, early data suggest that MALT1 is a promising target for ABC-DLBCL and possibly other B-cell malignancies, and can have lymphoma cell-intrinsic as well as immune-mediated therapeutic effects.	2022	04	20	Leuk Lymphoma	Seshadri	Madhav R
34906687	10.1016/j.fsi.2021.12.009	BCL10 regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by activating MAPK-NF-κB/Rel signaling pathway in oysters.	B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) is an important member of the caspase recruitment domain-containing (CARD) protein family, which plays crucial roles in mediating the host inflammatory response. In the present study, a BCL10 homologue was identified from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (designed as CgBCL10). The full length cDNA of CgBCL10 was of 897 bp with an open reading frame of 522 bp encoding a polypeptide of 174 amino acids containing a classical CARD domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgBCL10 shared low similarity with the previously identified BCL10s from other species. In the phylogenetic tree, CgBCL10 was firstly clustered with CvBCL10 from Crassostrea virginica and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate BCL10s. The mRNA transcripts of CgBCL10 were highly expressed in gonad, gill, adductor muscle, and haemocytes. After Vibrio splendidus stimulation, the mRNA expression level of CgBCL10 in haemocytes increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) at 24, 72 and 96 h. In CgBCL10-RNAi oysters, the phosphorylation level of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in haemocytes were inhibited, and the mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines including CgIL17-1, CgIL17-2, CgIL17-3, CgIL17-6 and CgTNF all decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) at 12 h after V. splendidus stimulation. These results suggested that CgBCL10 regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines by activating MAPK kinase, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel and AP-1 to defense pathogen.	2022	02	25	Fish Shellfish Immunol	Zhang	Tong
35099607	10.1007/s00018-022-04154-z	A20 and ABIN-1 cooperate in balancing CBM complex-triggered NF-κB signaling in activated T cells.	T cell activation initiates protective adaptive immunity, but counterbalancing mechanisms are critical to prevent overshooting responses and to maintain immune homeostasis. The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex bridges T cell receptor engagement to NF-κB signaling and MALT1 protease activation. Here, we show that ABIN-1 is modulating the suppressive function of A20 in T cells. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified ABIN-1 as an interactor of the CBM signalosome in activated T cells. A20 and ABIN-1 counteract inducible activation of human primary CD4 and Jurkat T cells. While A20 overexpression is able to silence CBM complex-triggered NF-κB and MALT1 protease activation independent of ABIN-1, the negative regulatory function of ABIN-1 depends on A20. The suppressive function of A20 in T cells relies on ubiquitin binding through the C-terminal zinc finger (ZnF)4/7 motifs, but does not involve the deubiquitinating activity of the OTU domain. Our mechanistic studies reveal that the A20/ABIN-1 module is recruited to the CBM complex via A20 ZnF4/7 and that proteasomal degradation of A20 and ABIN-1 releases the CBM complex from the negative impact of both regulators. Ubiquitin binding to A20 ZnF4/7 promotes destructive K48-polyubiquitination to itself and to ABIN-1. Further, after prolonged T cell stimulation, ABIN-1 antagonizes MALT1-catalyzed cleavage of re-synthesized A20 and thereby diminishes sustained CBM complex signaling. Taken together, interdependent post-translational mechanisms are tightly controlling expression and activity of the A20/ABIN-1 silencing module and the cooperative action of both negative regulators is critical to balance CBM complex signaling and T cell activation.	2022	02	03	Cell Mol Life Sci	Yin	Hongli
35192832	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153990	Effects of gestational exposure to bisphenol A on the hepatic transcriptome and lipidome of rat dams: Intergenerational comparison of effects in the offspring.	Our previous studies demonstrated that prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure affected the hepatic transcriptome and lipidome in rat offspring in a sex- and age-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the effects of gestational exposure to BPA on the rat dams, after weaning period, and compared them with those of their offspring. Our results showed alterations in hepatic transcriptome related to insulin signaling, circadian rhythm, and infectious disease pathways in BPA-treated dams even 4 weeks after the exposure, whereas slight modifications on the lipid profile were found. Alterations in lipid and transcriptome profiles were more prominent in the prenatally BPA-exposed offspring at postnatal day (PND) 1 and 21 than those in the dams, suggesting that in utero exposure to BPA is more serious than exposure in the adulthood. Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (Ppard) were commonly altered in both dams and offspring. Nevertheless, the results of DIABLO (Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents), showed that multi-omics data successfully distinguished the exposed dams from the corresponding controls and their offspring with a high level of accuracy. The accuracy rates in BPA50 models (including control and 50 μg BPA/kg bw/day exposed groups) were smaller than those in BPA5000 models (control and 5000 μg BPA/kg bw/day exposed groups), suggesting dose-dependent severity in BPA effects. Palmitic acid and genes related to circadian rhythm, insulin responses, and lipid metabolism (e.g., 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (Agpat2), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), Cry1, Harvey rat sarcoma virus oncogene (Hras), and NLR family member X1 (Nlrx1)) were identified through DIABLO models as novel biomarkers of effects of BPA across two generations.	2022	05	04	Sci Total Environ	Nguyen	Hoa Thanh

Conversely it also acts as a paracaspase to cleave specified substrates. Because of its involvement in immunity, inflammation and cancer through its dual functions of scaffolding and catalytic activity, MALT1 is becoming a promising therapeutic target in B cell- and T cell-related diseases. There is growing evidence that the function of MALT1 is subtly modulated via post-translational modifications. This review summarized recent progress in relevant studies regarding the physiological and pathophysiological functions of MALT1, post-translational modifications of MALT1 and its role in B cell- and T cell- related diseases. In addition, the current available MALT1 inhibitors were also discussed.	2022	04	25	Biochem Pharmacol	Zhang	Yi-Yue
35230873	10.1126/scisignal.abk3083	Phosphorylation of serine-893 in CARD11 suppresses the formation and activity of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex in T and B cells.	CARD11 acts as a gatekeeper for adaptive immune responses after T cell or B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) ligation on lymphocytes. PKCθ/β-catalyzed phosphorylation of CARD11 promotes the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex and lymphocyte activation. Here, we demonstrated that PKCθ/β-dependent CARD11 phosphorylation also suppressed CARD11 functions in T or B cells. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis, we identified multiple constitutive and inducible CARD11 phosphorylation sites in T cells. We demonstrated that a single TCR- or BCR-inducible phosphorylation on Ser<sup>893</sup> in the carboxyl terminus of CARD11 prevented the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the kinase JNK, and the protease MALT1. Moreover, CARD11 Ser<sup>893</sup> phosphorylation sensitized BCR-addicted lymphoma cells to toxicity induced by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>893</sup> in CARD11 by PKCθ controlled the strength of CARD11 scaffolding by impairing the formation of the CBM complex. Thus, PKCθ simultaneously catalyzes both stimulatory and inhibitory CARD11 phosphorylation events, which shape the strength of CARD11 signaling in lymphocytes.	2022	03	31	Sci Signal	Kutzner	Kerstin
35255409	10.1016/j.jbior.2022.100890	CARD11 signaling in regulatory T cell development and function.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a critical subset of CD4 T cells that modulate the immune response to prevent autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. CARD11, a signaling hub and scaffold protein that links antigen receptor engagement to activation of NF-κB and other downstream signaling pathways, is essential for the development and function of thymic Tregs. Mouse models with deficiencies in CARD11 and CARD11-associated signaling components generally have Treg defects, but some mouse models develop overt autoimmunity and inflammatory disease whereas others do not. Inhibition of CARD11 signaling in Tregs within the tumor microenvironment can potentially promote anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we summarize evidence for the involvement of CARD11 signaling in Treg development and function and discuss key unanswered questions and future research opportunities.	2022	05	30	Adv Biol Regul	Carter	Nicole M
35406516	10.3390/cancers14071742	Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Treatment.	Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma (EMZL lymphoma) is an indolent B-cell lymphoma with a median age at diagnosis of about 60 years. It accounts for 7-8% of all B-cell lymphomas. It can occur in various extranodal sites, including stomach, lung, ocular adnexa, and skin; furthermore, the disseminated disease can be found in 25-50% of cases. Several infectious agents, such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. Pylori</i>) in the case of gastric Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma, can drive the pathogenesis of this cancer, through the autoantigenic stimulation of T cells, but there may also be other factors participating such autoimmune diseases. Initial staging should include total body computed tomography, bone marrow aspirate, and endoscopic investigation if indicated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), should be performed to detect the presence of specific chromosomal translocations involving the <i>MALT1</i> and <i>BCL10</i> genes, which leads to the activation of the <i>NF-κB</i> signaling pathway. Depending on the location and dissemination of the disease, different therapeutic choices may include targeted therapy against the etiopathogenetic agent, radiotherapy, immunochemotherapy, and biological drugs. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the complex biology and the diagnosis of this disease and to better define new treatment strategies.	2022	04	15	Cancers (Basel)	Di Rocco	Alice
35411950	10.1002/cbf.3702	USP7 sustains an active epigenetic program via stabilizing MLL2 and WDR5 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Activated B-cell-like (ABC)-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) is a common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor prognosis. The survival of ABC-DLBCL relies on constitutive activation of BCR signaling, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully addressed. By mining The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we found that the expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is significantly elevated in three cancer types including DLBCL. Interestingly, unlike germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL, ABC-DLBCL shows upregulated expression of USP7. Inhibiting the enzymatic activity of USP7 (P22077) has a drastic effect on ABC-DLBCL, but not GCB-DLBCL cells. Compared to GCB-DLBCL, ABC-DLBCL cells show transcriptional upregulation of multiple components of BCR-signaling. USP7 inhibition significantly reduces the expression of upregulated components of BCR signaling. Mechanistically, USP7 inhibition greatly reduces the methylation of histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me2), which is an epigenetic marker for active enhancers. USP7 inhibition greatly reduces the protein level of WDR5 and MLL2, key components of lysine-specific methyltransferase complex (complex of proteins associated with Set1 [COMPASS]). In ABC-DLBCL cells, USP7 stabilizes WDR5 and MLL2. In patients, the expression of USP7 is significantly associated with components of BCR signaling (LYN, SYK, BTK, PLCG2, PRKCB, MALT1, BCL10, and CARD11) and targets of BCR signaling (MYC and IRF4). In summary, we demonstrated an essential role of USP7 in ABC-DLBCL by organizing an oncogenic epigenetic program via stabilization of WDR5 and MLL2. Targeting USP7 might be a novel and efficient approach to treat patients with ABC-DLBCL and it might be better than targeting individual components such as BTK in BCR signaling.	2022	06	09	Cell Biochem Funct	Wu	Yuanyuan

35600392	10.3389/fonc.2022.881801	SOCS3 Acts as an Onco-immunological Biomarker With Value in Assessing the Tumor Microenvironment, Pathological Staging, Histological Subtypes, Therapeutic Effect, and Prognoses of Several Types of Cancer.	The suppressor of cytokine signaling (<i>SOCS</i>) family contains eight members, including <i>SOCS1-7</i> and <i>CIS</i>, and <i>SOCS3</i> has been shown to inhibit cytokine signal transduction in various signaling pathways. Although several studies have currently shown the correlations between <i>SOCS3</i> and several types of cancer, no pan-cancer analysis is available to date. We used various computational tools to explore the expression and pathogenic roles of <i>SOCS3</i> in several types of cancer, assessing its potential role in the pathogenesis of cancer, in tumor immune infiltration, tumor progression, immune evasion, therapeutic response, and prognostic. The results showed that <i>SOCS3</i> was downregulated in most The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer datasets but was highly expressed in brain tumors, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphoma. High <i>SOCS3</i> expression in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) were verified through immunohistochemical experiments. GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter were used, and this bioinformatics analysis showed that high <i>SOCS3</i> expression was associated with a poor prognosis in the majority of cancers, including LGG and GBM. Our analysis also indicated that <i>SOCS3</i> may be involved in tumor immune evasion <i>via</i> immune cell infiltration or T-cell exclusion across different types of cancer. In addition, <i>SOCS3</i> methylation was negatively correlated with <i>mRNA</i> expression levels, worse prognoses, and dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes in various types of cancer. Next, different analytical methods were used to select genes related to <i>SOCS3</i> gene alterations and carcinogenic characteristics, such as <i>STAT3</i>, <i>SNAI1</i>, <i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, <i>TK1</i>, <i>PGS1</i>, <i>BIRC5</i>, <i>TMC8</i>, and <i>AFMID</i>, and several biological functions were identified between them. We found that <i>SOCS3</i> was involved in cancer development primarily through the <i>JAK/STAT</i> signaling pathway and cytokine receptor activity. Furthermore, <i>SOCS3</i> expression levels were associated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy for numerous types of cancer. In conclusion, this study showed that <i>SOCS3</i> is an immune-oncogenic molecule that may possess value as a biomarker for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of several types of cancer in the future.	2022	07	16	Front Oncol	Dai	Lirui
35658124	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-1566	BCL10 Mutations Define Distinct Dependencies Guiding Precision Therapy for DLBCL.	Activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCL) have unfavorable outcomes and chronic activation of CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signal amplification complexes that form due to polymerization of BCL10 subunits, which is affected by recurrent somatic mutations in ABC-DLBCLs. Herein, we show that BCL10 mutants fall into at least two functionally distinct classes: missense mutations of the BCL10 CARD domain and truncation of its C-terminal tail. Truncating mutations abrogated a motif through which MALT1 inhibits BCL10 polymerization, trapping MALT1 in its activated filament-bound state. CARD missense mutations enhanced BCL10 filament formation, forming glutamine network structures that stabilize BCL10 filaments. Mutant forms of BCL10 were less dependent on upstream CARD11 activation and thus manifested resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10 truncating but not CARD mutants were hypersensitive to MALT1 inhibitors. Therefore, BCL10 mutations are potential biomarkers for BTK inhibitor resistance in ABC-DLBCL, and further precision can be achieved by selecting therapy based on specific biochemical effects of distinct mutation classes. ABC-DLBCLs feature frequent mutations of signaling mediators that converge on the CBM complex. We use structure-function approaches to reveal that BCL10 mutations fall into two distinct biochemical classes. Both classes confer resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10 truncations confer hyperresponsiveness to MALT1 inhibitors, providing a road map for precision therapies in ABC-DLBCLs.

35727133	10.7554/eLife.79826	A nucleation barrier spring-loads the CBM signalosome for binary activation.	Immune cells activate in binary, switch-like fashion via large protein assemblies known as signalosomes, but the molecular mechanism of the switch is not yet understood. Here, we employed an in-cell biophysical approach to dissect the assembly mechanism of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, which governs nuclear transcription factor-κB activation in both innate and adaptive immunity. We found that the switch consists of a sequence-encoded and deeply conserved nucleation barrier to ordered polymerization by the adaptor protein BCL10. The particular structure of the BCL10 polymers did not matter for activity. Using optogenetic tools and single-cell transcriptional reporters, we discovered that endogenous BCL10 is functionally supersaturated even in unstimulated human cells, and this results in a predetermined response to stimulation upon nucleation by activated CARD multimers. Our findings may inform on the progressive nature of age-associated inflammation, and suggest that signalosome structure has evolved via selection for kinetic rather than equilibrium properties of the proteins. The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defence against pathogens. Although innate immune cells do not recognize specific disease-causing agents, they can detect extremely low levels of harmful organisms or substances. In response, they activate signals that lead to inflammation, which tells other cells that there is an infection. Innate immune cells are turned on in a switch-like fashion, becoming active very quickly after interacting with a pathogen. This is due to the action of signalosomes, large complexes made up of several proteins that clump together to form long chains that activate the cell. But how do these large protein complexes assemble quick enough to create the switch-like activation observed in innate immune cells? To answer this question, Rodríguez Gama et al. focused on the CBM signalosome, which is involved in triggering inflammation through the activation of a protein called NF-kB. First, Rodríguez Gama et al. used genetic tools to determine that activating the CBM signalosome drives a switch-like activation of NF-kB in cells. This means that individual cells in a population either become fully activated or not at all in response to minute amounts of harmful substances. Once they had established this, Rodríguez Gama et al. wanted to know which protein in the CBM signalosome was responsible for the switch. They found that one of the proteins in the signalosome, called BCL10, has a ‘nucleation barrier’ encoded in its sequence. This means that it is very hard for BCL10 to start clumping together, but once it does, the clumps grow on their own. The nucleation barrier describes exactly how hard it is for these clumps to get started, and is determined by how disorganized the protein is. When a pathogen ‘stimulates’ an immune cell, a tiny template is formed that lowers the nucleation barrier so that BCL10 can then aggregate itself together, leading to the switch-like behaviour observed. The nucleation barrier allows there to be more than enough BCL10 present in the cell at all times – ready to clump together at a moment’s notice – and this permits the cell to detect very low levels of a pathogen. Rodríguez Gama et al. then tested whether BCL10 from other animals also has a nucleation barrier. They found that this feature is conserved from cnidarians, such as corals or jellyfish, to mammals, including humans. This suggests that the use of nucleation barriers to regulate innate immune signalling has existed for a long time throughout evolution. The work by Rodríguez Gama et al. broadens our understanding of how the innate immune system senses and responds to extremely low levels of pathogens. That BCL10 is always ready to clump together suggests it may be a driving force for chronic and age-associated inflammation. Additionally, the findings of Rodríguez Gama et al. also offer insights into how other signalosomes may become activated, and offer the possibility of new drugs aimed at modifying nucleation barriers.	2022	08	03	Elife	Rodriguez Gama	Alejandro
35750252	10.1016/j.clim.2022.109067	BCL10 loss-of-function novel mutation leading to atypical severe combined immunodeficiency.	Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by severe, early-onset infection in infants. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL) 10 defects causing SCID have been reported previously in two patients. A seven-month-old female infant was admitted with bilateral pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. She had a history of recurrent infections starting from four months of age. The patient was investigated for primary immunodeficiency. Immunological investigations revealed hypogammaglobulinemia with normal CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts, while a lymphocyte proliferation assay showed absent response to phytohemagglutinin stimulation, thereby establishing the diagnosis of an atypical form of SCID. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous mutation in the BCL10 gene, with both parents demonstrating a heterozygous state (NM_003921.5:c.271A &gt; C:p.[Thr91Pro]). The patient died before bone marrow transplantation due to severe disseminated adenovirus disease. We report the first patient from the Middle East with a novel homozygous mutation in the BCL10 gene causing SCID.	2022	08	09	Clin Immunol	Al-Tamemi	Salem

35981904	10.1016/j.jaci.2022.06.023	The role of the CBM complex in allergic inflammation and disease.	The caspase activation and recruitment domain-coiled-coil (CARD-CC) family of proteins-CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14-is collectively expressed across nearly all tissues of the body and is a crucial mediator of immunologic signaling as part of the CARD-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (CBM) complex. Dysfunction or dysregulation of CBM proteins has been linked to numerous clinical manifestations known as ""CBM-opathies."" The CBM-opathy spectrum encompasses diseases ranging from mucocutaneous fungal infections and psoriasis to combined immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative diseases; however, there is accumulating evidence that the CARD-CC family members also contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of allergic inflammation and allergic diseases. Here, we review the 4 CARD-CC paralogs, as well as B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1, and their individual and collective roles in the pathogenesis and progression of allergic inflammation and 4 major allergic diseases (allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis).	2022	08	18	J Allergy Clin Immunol	DeVore	Stanley B
36094731	10.1007/s12104-022-10105-3	Assignment of IVL-Methyl side chain of the ligand-free monomeric human MALT1 paracaspase-IgL<sub>3</sub> domain in solution.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein 1 (MALT1) plays a key role in adaptive immune responses by modulating specific intracellular signalling pathways that control the development and proliferation of both T and B cells. Dysfunction of these pathways is coupled to the progress of highly aggressive lymphoma as well as to potential development of an array of different immune disorders. In contrast to other signalling mediators, MALT1 is not only activated through the formation of the CBM complex together with the proteins CARMA1 and Bcl10, but also by acting as a protease that cleaves multiple substrates to promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival via the NF-κB signalling pathway. Herein, we present the partial <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C Ile/Val/Leu-Methyl resonance assignment of the monomeric apo form of the paracaspase-IgL<sub>3</sub> domain of human MALT1.

31595055	10.1038/s41423-019-0297-y	Bcl10 is required for the development and suppressive function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells.	Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in peripheral tolerance. Bcl10, acting as a scaffolding protein in the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex, has a critical role in TCR-induced signaling, leading to NF-κB activation and is required for T-cell activation. The role of Bcl10 in conventional T (Tconv) cells has been well characterized; however, the role of Bcl10 in the development of Treg cells and the maintenance of the suppressive function and identity of these cells has not been well characterized. In this study, we found that Bcl10 was required for not only the development but also the function of Treg cells. After deleting Bcl10 in T cells, we found that the development of Treg cells was significantly impaired. When Bcl10 was specifically deleted in mature Treg cells, the suppressive function of the Treg cells was impaired, leading to lethal autoimmunity in Bcl10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> mice. Consistently, in contrast to WT Treg cells, Bcl10-deficient Treg cells could not protect Rag1-deficient mice from T-cell transfer-induced colitis. Furthermore, Bcl10-deficient Treg cells downregulated the expression of a series of Treg-cell effector and suppressive genes and decreased effector Treg-cell populations. Moreover, Bcl10-deficient Treg cells were converted into IFNγ-producing proinflammatory cells with increased expression of the transcription factors T-bet and HIF-1α. Together, our study results provide genetic evidence, indicating that Bcl10 is required for the development and function of Treg cells.	2021	12	27	Cell Mol Immunol	Yang	Dandan
32790937	10.1111/febs.15522	Defining the combinatorial space of PKC::CARD-CC signal transduction nodes.	Signal transduction typically displays a so-called bow-tie topology: Multiple receptors lead to multiple cellular responses but the signals all pass through a narrow waist of central signaling nodes. One such signaling node for several inflammatory and oncogenic signaling pathways is the CARD-CC/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complexes, which get activated by protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-coiled-coil domain (CC) component. In humans, there are four CARD-CC family proteins (CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14) and 9 true PKC isozymes (α to ι). At this moment, less than a handful of PKC::CARD-CC relationships are known. In order to explore the biologically relevant combinatorial space out of all 36 potential permutations in this two-component signaling event, we made use of CARD10-deficient human embryonic kidney 293T cells for subsequent pairwise cotransfections of all CARD-CC family members and all activated PKCs. Upon analysis of NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, we could define specific PKC::CARD-CC relationships. Surprisingly, as many as 21 PKC::CARD-CC functional combinations were identified. CARD10 was responsive to most PKCs, while CARD14 was mainly activated by PKCδ. The CARD11 activation profile was most similar to that of CARD9. We also discovered the existence of mixed protein complexes between different CARD-CC proteins, which was shown to influence their PKC response profile. Finally, multiple PKCs were found to use a common phosphorylation site to activate CARD9, while additional phosphorylation sites contribute to CARD14 activation. Together, these data reveal the combinatorial space of PKC::CARD-CC signal transduction nodes, which will be valuable for future studies on the regulation of CBM signaling.	2021	07	20	FEBS J	Staal	Jens
32838054	10.1016/j.coemr.2020.07.011	Subcellular hot spots of GPCR signaling promote vascular inflammation.	G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest class of druggable targets. Signaling by GPCRs is initiated from subcellular hot spots including the plasma membrane, signalosomes, and endosomes to contribute to vascular inflammation. GPCR-G protein signaling at the plasma membrane causes endothelial barrier disruption and also cross-talks with growth factor receptors to promote proinflammatory signaling. A second surge of GPCR signaling is initiated by cytoplasmic NFκB activation mediated by β-arrestins and CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 signalosomes. Once internalized, ubiquitinated GPCRs initiate signaling from endosomes via assembly of the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase binding protein-1 (TAB1)-TAB2-p38 MAPK complex to promote vascular inflammation. Understanding the complexities of GPCR signaling is critical for development of new strategies to treat vascular inflammation such as that associated with COVID-19.	2021	03	17	Curr Opin Endocr Metab Res	Birch	Cierra A
32855441	10.1038/s41379-020-00660-2	Deciphering the genetic landscape of pulmonary lymphomas.	Pulmonary lymphoid malignancies comprise various entities, 80% of them are pulmonary marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (PMZL). So far, little is known about point mutations in primary pulmonary lymphomas. We characterized the genetic landscape of primary pulmonary lymphomas using a customized high-throughput sequencing gene panel covering 146 genes. Our cohort consisted of 28 PMZL, 14 primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) of the lung, 7 lymphomatoid granulomatoses (LyG), 5 mature small B-cell lymphomas and 16 cases of reactive lymphoid lesions. Mutations were detected in 22/28 evaluable PMZL (median 2 mutation/case); 14/14 DLBCL (median 3 mutations/case) and 4/7 LyG (1 mutation/case). PMZL showed higher prevalence for mutations in chromatin modifier-encoding genes (44% of mutant genes), while mutations in genes related to the NF-κB pathway were less common (24% of observed mutations). There was little overlap between mutations in PMZL and DLBCL. MALT1 rearrangements were more prevalent in PMZL than BCL10 aberrations, and both were absent in DLBCL. LyG were devoid of gene mutations associated with immune escape. The mutational landscape of PMZL differs from that of extranodal MZL of other locations and also from splenic MZL. Their landscape resembles more that of nodal MZL, which also show a predominance of mutations of chromatin modifiers. The different mutational composition of pulmonary DLBCL compared to PMZL suggests that the former probably do not present transformations. DLBCL bear more mutations/case and immune escape gene mutations compared to LyG, suggesting that EBV infection in LyG may substitute for mutations.	2021	10	22	Mod Pathol	Vela	Visar
32927162	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111272	Augmented autophagy suppresses thymocytes development via Bcl10/p-p65 pathway in prenatal nicotine exposed fetal mice.	Tobacco smoke is a common global environmental pollutant. Maternal tobacco smoke/nicotine exposure has long-term toxic effects on immune organs. We previously found that prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE)-induced programmed immune diseases caused by fetal thymic hypoplasia, but the mechanism still unknown. Autophagy has important functions in maintaining thymopoiesis, whether autophagy was involved in PNE-inhibited fetal thymocytes development is also obscure. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how nicotine changed the development of fetal thymocytes from the perspective of autophagy in vivo and in vitro. PNE model was established by 3 mg/kg nicotine administration in Balb/c mice from gestational day 9 to 18. The results showed that PNE reduced the percentage and absolute number of CD69<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>SP cells, suggesting a block of fetal thymocytes mature. PNE promoted autophagosome formation, autophagy related proteins (Beclin1, LC3I/II) expression, and upregulated α7 nAChR as well as AMPK phosphorylation in fetal thymus. Moreover, PNE promoted Bcl10 degradation via autophagy-mediated proteolysis and inhibited p65 activation, blocking the transition of thymocytes between the DP to SP stage. Further, primary thymocytes were treated with nicotine in vitro and showed induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, nicotine-inhibited CD69<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>SP cells and the Bcl10/p-p65 pathway have been reversed by an autophagy inhibitor. The α7 nAChR specific antagonist abrogated nicotine-induced AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy initiation. In conclusion, our findings showed that PNE repressed the Bcl10/p-p65 development pathway of CD4<sup>+</sup>SP cells by triggering autophagy, and illuminated the developmental origin mechanism of programmed immune diseases in PNE offspring.	2020	12	04	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Yan	Hui-Yi

Increasing evidence has supported the crucial role of CARD14 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, whereas the precise cellular signaling involved in skin physiopathology remains poorly understood. In this article, we show that neither genetic ablation of <i>Il17a</i> nor elimination of T cells was sufficient to restrain the skin inflammation in a CARD14-E138A-mutation-induced psoriasis-like mouse model, whereas depletion of <i>Il23</i>, which extremely blocked the IL-23/T17 axis, was more effective. Targeting CBM complex by conditional deletion of MALT1 or BCL10 in keratinocytes abrogated both the cutaneous and systemic inflammation of heterozygous <i>Card14</i> <sup>E138A/+</sup> mice. Selective inactivation of keratinocyte-specific MALT1 proteolytic activity strongly ameliorated the <i>Card14</i> <sup>E138A/+</sup>- and <i>Card14</i> <sup>ΔQ136/+</sup>-induced skin disease, which was reproduced by using the imiquimod-induced mouse model. Together, our results suggest a sequence of events under CARD14-mutation-induced psoriasis condition that keratinocyte-intrinsic activation of CBM complex initiates the skin inflammation depending on the IL-23/T17 axis. Targeting keratinocytes by inactivation of MALT1 paracaspase activity might be a promising therapeutic target for early psoriasis treatment.	2021	07	19	J Immunol	Zhang	Shanshan
33640899	10.1038/s41392-021-00477-8	TRIM41 is required to innate antiviral response by polyubiquitinating BCL10 and recruiting NEMO.	Sensing of pathogenic nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) not only initiates anti-microbe defense but causes inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) critical in innate response need to be further identified. Here we report that the tripartite motif-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM41 is required to innate antiviral response through facilitating pathogenic nucleic acids-triggered signaling pathway. TRIM41 deficiency impairs the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons in macrophages after transfection with nucleic acid-mimics and infection with both DNA and RNA viruses. In vivo, TRIM41 deficiency leads to impaired innate response against viruses. Mechanistically, TRIM41 directly interacts with BCL10 (B cell lymphoma 10), a core component of CARD proteins-BCL10 - MALT1 (CBM) complex, and modifies the Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation of BCL10, which, in turn, hubs NEMO for activation of NF-κB and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) - interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathways. Our study suggests that TRIM41 is the potential universal E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for Lys63 linkage of BCL10 during innate antiviral response, adding new insight into the molecular mechanism for the control of innate antiviral response.	2022	03	04	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Yu	Zhou

However, the impact of CARD11 deficiency on human B-cell development, signaling, and function is incompletely understood. This study sought to determine the cellular, immunological, and biochemical basis of disease for 2 unrelated patients who presented with profound CID associated with viral and fungal respiratory infections, interstitial lung disease, and severe colitis. Patients underwent next-generation sequencing, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, signaling assays by immunoblot, and transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing. Both patients carried identical novel pathogenic biallelic loss-of-function variants in CARD11 (c.2509C&gt;T; p.Arg837∗) leading to undetectable protein expression. This variant prevented CBM complex formation, severely impairing the activation of nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and MALT1 paracaspase activity in B and T cells. This functional defect resulted in a developmental block in B cells at the naive and type 1 transitional B-cell stage and impaired circulating T follicular helper cell (cT<sub>FH</sub>) development, which was associated with impaired antibody responses and absent germinal center structures on lymph node histology. Transcriptomics indicated that CARD11-dependent signaling is essential for immune signaling pathways involved in the development of these cells. Both patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, which led to functional normalization. Complete human CARD11 deficiency causes profound CID by impairing naive/type 1 B-cell and cT<sub>FH</sub> cell development and abolishing activation of MALT1 paracaspase, NF-κB, and JNK activity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation functionally restores impaired signaling pathways.	2021	12	21	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Lu	Henry Y
33941870	10.1038/s41418-021-00787-y	USP12 promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses through deubiquitinating and stabilizing BCL10.	Deubiquitinases (DUBs) regulate diverse biological processes and represent a novel class of drug targets. However, the biological function of only a small fraction of DUBs, especially in adaptive immune response regulation, is well-defined. In this study, we identified DUB ubiquitin-specific peptidase 12 (USP12) as a critical regulator of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. USP12 plays an intrinsic role in promoting the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotype, including differentiation, activation, and proliferation. Although USP12-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells protected mice from autoimmune diseases, the immune response against bacterial infection was subdued. USP12 stabilized B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) by deubiquitinating, and thereby activated the NF-κB signaling pathway. Interestingly, this USP12 regulatory mechanism was identified in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our study results showed that USP12 activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell signaling, and targeting USP12 might help develop therapeutic interventions for treating inflammatory diseases or pathogen infections.	2022	03	25	Cell Death Differ	Fu	Yuling
34014917	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007986	Signaling through polymerization and degradation: Analysis and simulations of T cell activation mediated by Bcl10.	The adaptive immune system serves as a potent and highly specific defense mechanism against pathogen infection. One component of this system, the effector T cell, facilitates pathogen clearance upon detection of specific antigens by the T cell receptor (TCR). A critical process in effector T cell activation is transmission of signals from the TCR to a key transcriptional regulator, NF-κB. The transmission of this signal involves a highly dynamic process in which helical filaments of Bcl10, a key protein constituent of the TCR signaling cascade, undergo competing processes of polymeric assembly and macroautophagy-dependent degradation. Through computational analysis of three-dimensional, super-resolution optical micrographs, we quantitatively characterize TCR-stimulated Bcl10 filament assembly and length dynamics, and demonstrate that filaments become shorter over time. Additionally, we develop an image-based, bootstrap-like resampling method that demonstrates the preferred association between autophagosomes and both Bcl10-filament ends and punctate-Bcl10 structures, implying that autophagosome-driven macroautophagy is directly responsible for Bcl10 filament shortening. We probe Bcl10 polymerization-depolymerization dynamics with a stochastic Monte-Carlo simulation of nucleation-limited filament assembly and degradation, and we show that high probabilities of filament nucleation in response to TCR engagement could provide the observed robust, homogeneous, and tunable response dynamic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the speed of filament disassembly preferentially at filament ends provides effective regulatory control. Taken together, these data suggest that Bcl10 filament growth and degradation act as an excitable system that provides a digital response mechanism and the reliable timing critical for T cell activation and regulatory processes.	2021	09	10	PLoS Comput Biol	Campanello	Leonard
34192836	10.1515/hsz-2021-0250	The paracaspase MALT1 in psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a frequent autoimmune-related skin disease, which involves various cell types such as T cells, keratinocytes and dendritic cells. Genetic variations, such as mutations of <i>CARD14</i>, can promote the development of the disease. <i>CARD14</i> mutations as well as the stimulation of immune and cytokine receptors activate the paracaspase MALT1, a potent activator of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. The disease-promoting role of MALT1 for psoriasis is mediated by both its protease activity as well as its molecular scaffold function. Here, we review the importance of MALT1-mediated signaling and its therapeutic implications in psoriasis.	2021	12	30	Biol Chem	Hailfinger	Stephan
34236636	10.1007/978-1-0716-1669-7_8	Methods to Study CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 Dependent Canonical NF-κB Activation in Jurkat T Cells.	Jurkat T cells have been of central importance for the discovery of signalling mediators driving NF-κB activation in response to T cell antigen receptor (TCR)/CD28 co-stimulation. The critical function of the key regulators identified in Jurkat T cells has subsequently been verified in primary murine and human T cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing techniques in combination with viral reconstitution are powerful tools that now enable the investigation of the exact molecular mechanisms that govern T cell signalling, especially the impact of protein-protein interactions, protein modifications, or cancer-associated gain- or loss-of-function mutations. As exemplified by the CARD11 gene encoding a key regulator of NF-κB signalling in T cells, we describe here the detailed workflow for the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) Jurkat T cells and the subsequent reconstitution using a lentiviral transduction protocol. In addition, we explain the use of a stable NF-κB-dependent EGFP reporter system that enables a reliable quantification of NF-κB transcriptional activation in the reconstituted KO Jurkat T cells.	2022	01	12	Methods Mol Biol	Gewies	Andreas
34412631	10.1186/s12935-021-02143-z	Contribution of nuclear BCL10 expression to tumor progression and poor prognosis of advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by activating NF-κB-related signaling.	We previously demonstrated that nuclear BCL10 translocation participates in the instigation of NF-κB in breast cancer and lymphoma cell lines. In this study, we assessed whether nuclear BCL10 translocation is clinically significant in advanced and metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We analyzed the expression of BCL10-, cell cycle-, and NF-κB- related signaling molecules, and the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in three PDAC cell lines (mutant KRAS lines: PANC-1 and AsPC-1; wild-type KRAS line: BxPC-3) using BCL10 short hairpin RNA (shBCL10). To assess the anti-tumor effect of BCL10 knockdown in PDAC xenograft model, PANC-1 cells treated with or without shBCL10 transfection were inoculated into the flanks of mice. We assessed the expression patterns of BCL10 and NF-κB in tumor cells in 136 patients with recurrent, advanced, and metastatic PDAC using immunohistochemical staining. We revealed that shBCL10 transfection caused cytoplasmic translocation of BCL10 from the nuclei, inhibited cell viability, and enhanced the cytotoxicities of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in three PDAC cell lines. Inhibition of BCL10 differentially blocked cell cycle progression in PDAC cell lines. Arrest at G1 phase was noted in wild-type KRAS cell lines; and arrest at G2/M phase was noted in mutant KRAS cell lines. Furthermore, shBCL10 transfection downregulated the expression of phospho-CDC2, phospho-CDC25C, Cyclin B1 (PANC-1), Cyclins A, D1, and E, CDK2, and CDK4 (BxPC-3), p-IκBα, nuclear expression of BCL10, BCL3, and NF-κB (p65), and attenuated the NF-κB pathway activation and its downstream molecule, c-Myc, while inhibition of BCL10 upregulated expression of p21, and p27 in both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. In a PANC-1-xenograft mouse model, inhibition of BCL10 expression also attenuated the tumor growth of PDAC. In clinical samples, nuclear BCL10 expression was closely associated with nuclear NF-κB expression (p &lt; 0.001), and patients with nuclear BCL10 expression had the worse median overall survival than those without nuclear BCL10 expression (6.90 months versus 9.53 months, p = 0.019). Nuclear BCL10 translocation activates NF-κB signaling and contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis of advanced/metastatic PDAC.	2021	08	22	Cancer Cell Int	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
34481211	10.1016/j.prp.2021.153593	Bcl-10, trypsin and synaptophysin helps recognize acinar cell and mixed acinar neuroendocrine cell carcinoma of the pancreas on both preoperative cytological samples and needle biopsy specimens.	Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas are known to be rare and difficult to be recognize because they mimic other unrelated tumors (neuroendocrine, solid pseudopapillary) with different clinical behavior. Especially in the setting of inoperable patients, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), core needle biopsy (FNAB) and immunocyto/histochemistry (ICC/IHC) play a crucial role in the differential diagnosis. The biological material available for ICC tests obtained by minimal invasive procedures is usually limited. Aim of the current study was to evaluate diagnostic panel based on a limited number of ICC markers for typing preoperatively ACC of the pancreas. Of 1820 needle sampling procedures performed and related to pancreatic lesions, 21 cases were extracted with a confirmed diagnosis of ACC on histology. Of them,12 were pure ACC and 9 mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC). Smears of ACC, MANEC and a control group composed of 34neuroendocrine, 7solid pseudopapillary, 50ductal and 4 adenosquamous carcinoma were assessed with an ICC panel made up of BCL10, trypsin, synaptophysin, chromograninA, β-catenin. On cytology, BCL10 sensitivity and specificity for ACC was 100%. Trypsin correctly recognized 90% of the cases. Synaptophysin was helpful to correctly identify all the cases with a mixed neuroendocrine component. No significant cross-reaction was observed between BCL10 and trypsin in any of the control group case. BCL10 is a determinant marker for the diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma and mixed acinar neuroendocrine cell carcinoma of the pancreas in a pre-operative citologic/histologic setting.	2022	01	28	Pathol Res Pract	Manfrin	Erminia

34826258	10.1126/sciimmunol.abi4425	Keratinocyte-intrinsic BCL10/MALT1 activity initiates and amplifies psoriasiform skin inflammation.	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease arising from poorly defined pathological cross-talk between keratinocytes and the immune system. BCL10 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10) and MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) are ubiquitously expressed inflammatory signaling proteins that can interact with the psoriasis susceptibility factor CARD14, but their functions in psoriasis are insufficiently understood. We report that although keratinocyte-intrinsic BCL10/MALT1 deletions completely rescue inflammatory skin pathology triggered by germline <i>Card14</i> gain-of-function mutation in mice, the BCL10/MALT1 signalosome is unexpectedly not involved in the CARD14-dependent interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) proximal pathway. Instead, it plays a more pleiotropic role by amplifying keratinocyte responses to a series of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-1β, and TNF. Moreover, selective keratinocyte-intrinsic activation of BCL10/MALT1 signaling with an artificial engager molecule is sufficient to initiate lymphocyte-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation, and aberrant BCL10/MALT1 activity is frequently detected in the skin of human sporadic psoriasis. Together, these results establish that BCL10/MALT1 signalosomes can act as initiators and crucial amplifiers of psoriatic skin inflammation and indicate a critical function for this complex in sporadic psoriasis.	2022	03	07	Sci Immunol	Kurgyis	Zsuzsanna
34868072	10.3389/fimmu.2021.786572	Clinical and Immunological Features of Human BCL10 Deficiency.	The CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex is critical for the proper assembly of human immune responses. The clinical and immunological consequences of deficiencies in some of its components such as CARD9, CARD11, and MALT1 have been elucidated in detail. However, the scarcity of BCL10 deficient patients has prevented gaining detailed knowledge about this genetic disease. Only two patients with BCL10 deficiency have been reported to date. Here we provide an in-depth description of an additional patient with autosomal recessive complete BCL10 deficiency caused by a nonsense mutation that leads to a loss of expression (K63X). Using mass cytometry coupled with unsupervised clustering and machine learning computational methods, we obtained a thorough characterization of the consequences of BCL10 deficiency in different populations of leukocytes. We showed that in addition to the near absence of memory B and T cells previously reported, this patient displays a reduction in NK, γδT, Tregs, and T<sub>FH</sub> cells. The patient had recurrent respiratory infections since early childhood, and showed a family history of lethal severe infectious diseases. Fortunately, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) cured her. Overall, this report highlights the importance of early genetic diagnosis for the management of BCL10 deficient patients and HSCT as the recommended treatment to cure this disease.	2022	02	14	Front Immunol	Garcia-Solis	Blanca
34879060	10.1371/journal.pntd.0010029	Deep resequencing identifies candidate functional genes in leprosy GWAS loci.	Leprosy is the second most prevalent mycobacterial disease globally. Despite the existence of an effective therapy, leprosy incidence has consistently remained above 200,000 cases per year since 2010. Numerous host genetic factors have been identified for leprosy that contribute to the persistently high case numbers. In the past decade, genetic epidemiology approaches, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identified more than 30 loci contributing to leprosy susceptibility. However, GWAS loci commonly encompass multiple genes, which poses a challenge to define causal candidates for each locus. To address this problem, we hypothesized that genes contributing to leprosy susceptibility differ in their frequencies of rare protein-altering variants between cases and controls. Using deep resequencing we assessed protein-coding variants for 34 genes located in GWAS or linkage loci in 555 Vietnamese leprosy cases and 500 healthy controls. We observed 234 nonsynonymous mutations in the targeted genes. A significant depletion of protein-altering variants was detected for the IL18R1 and BCL10 genes in leprosy cases. The IL18R1 gene is clustered with IL18RAP and IL1RL1 in the leprosy GWAS locus on chromosome 2q12.1. Moreover, in a recent GWAS we identified an HLA-independent signal of association with leprosy on chromosome 6p21. Here, we report amino acid changes in the CDSN and PSORS1C2 genes depleted in leprosy cases, indicating them as candidate genes in the chromosome 6p21 locus. Our results show that deep resequencing can identify leprosy candidate susceptibility genes that had been missed by classic linkage and association approaches.	2022	02	16	PLoS Negl Trop Dis	Fava	Vinicius M
34928543	10.1002/iub.2581	BCL10 correlates with bad prognosis and immune infiltration of tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.	It has been reported that B-cell CLL-lymphoma 10 (BCL10) serves as an oncogene in cervical cancer. However, the roles of BCL10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially involved in immune infiltration remain not clear. This study aims to explore the relationship between BCL10 and the prognosis and clinical significance, and immune infiltration in HCC. The expression of BCL10 was analyzed between HCC samples and non-tumor samples in the multiple datasets. In addition, the prognostic values of BCL10 and its methylation in HCC were also investigated. The clinical significance of BCL10 has also been explored. Furthermore, the correlation between BCL10 and immune infiltration in HCC microenvironment was assessed. Finally, the biological behaviors of BCL10 in HCC were verified by cell function experiments. It was found that the expression levels of BCL10 were increased in HCC patients in multiple datasets. Moreover, the increased BCL10 and its reduced methylation were associated with the poor survival. BCL10 was significantly associated with immune infiltration. When BCL10 was knocked down in HCC cells, their proliferation ability was significantly inhibited, their migration was significantly decreased, their apoptosis was significantly increased, and AKT signaling pathway was inhibited. In conclusion, BCL10 is a potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarker related to immune infiltration in HCC microenvironment.	2022	01	08	IUBMB Life	Chen	Hao
31241148	10.1093/cvr/cvz169	B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 10 and angiotensin II-induced kidney injury.	B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 10 (Bcl10) is a member of the CARMA-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome, linking angiotensin (Ang) II, and antigen-dependent immune-cell activation to nuclear factor kappa-B signalling. We showed earlier that Bcl10 plays a role in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodelling, independent of blood pressure. We now investigated the role of Bcl10 in Ang II-induced renal damage. Bcl10 knockout mice (Bcl10 KO) and wild-type (WT) controls were given 1% NaCl in the drinking water and Ang II (1.44 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Additionally, Bcl10 KO or WT kidneys were transplanted onto WT mice that were challenged by the same protocol for 7 days. Kidneys of Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice developed less fibrosis and showed fewer infiltrating cells. Nevertheless, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal) and kidney injury molecule (Kim)1 expression was higher in the kidneys of Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice, indicating exacerbated tubular damage. Furthermore, albuminuria was significantly higher in Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice accompanied by reduced glomerular nephrin expression and podocyte number. Ang II-treated WT mice transplanted with Bcl10 KO kidney showed more albuminuria and renal Ngal, compared to WT- &gt; WT kidney-transplanted mice, as well as lower podocyte number but similar fibrosis and cell infiltration. Interestingly, mice lacking Bcl10 in the kidney exhibited less Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy than controls. Bcl10 has multi-faceted actions in Ang II-induced renal damage. On the one hand, global Bcl10 deficiency ameliorates renal fibrosis and cell infiltration; on the other hand, lack of renal Bcl10 aggravates albuminuria and podocyte damage. These data suggest that Bcl10 maintains podocyte integrity and renal function.	2020	10	19	Cardiovasc Res	Markó	Lajos
31751629	10.1016/j.dci.2019.103555	The signaling relations between three adaptors of porcine C-type lectin receptor pathway.	As one family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), The C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) play a key role in the anti-fungal infection. The CLR pathway signaling is relayed by adaptor complex which comprises CARD9, BCL10 and MALT1. However, the relationship between these three adaptors has not been investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine CARD9, BCL10 and MALT1 and examined their signaling functions. The three ectopic adaptors were similarly and uniformly expressed in cytoplasm, with CARD9 inactive, BCL10 significant active, and MALT1 slightly active for downstream NF-κB signaling and gene expressions. With the three adaptors together, NF-κB signaling and gene expressions were strongly activated, however, no IFN signal was activated in any case. The signaling relationship between the adaptors were dissected, the NF-κB signaling results showed that CARD9 could inhibit both BCL10 and MALT1 activities, while BCL10 and MALT1 synergized each other particularly when moderate amount of BCL10 plus low amount of MALT1 were considered. Low amount of CARD9 could further synergized with BCL10 and MALT1, maximizing signaling activity of the adaptor complex. This study revealed the porcine CLR pathway adaptor signaling functions and their optimal collective activity, thus providing a unique insight into the porcine innate immunity.	2021	06	23	Dev Comp Immunol	Jiang	Sen
31757436	10.1016/j.pathol.2019.08.012	Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma: lessons from Western and Eastern diagnostic approaches.	Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZLs) are a group of clinically indolent B-cell lymphomas postulated to derive from memory B lymphocytes in the 'marginal zone' of secondary lymphoid tissue. Today, MZL is recognised as a nosological umbrella term encompassing distinct entities with some shared phenotypic and genotypic features, including extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (EMZL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, splenic MZL, and nodal MZL, accounting for approximately 70%, 20%, and 10% of MZLs, respectively. These lymphomas share some phenotypic and genotypic features and have some variants and related provisional diseases, but are different in regards to their clinical and molecular characteristics. In addition, they are frequently associated with chronic antigenic stimulation represented either by infectious agents, particularly bacteria and viruses, or autoimmune diseases as exemplified by Sjögren syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and newly recognised IgG4-related disease. Furthermore, several chromosomal translocations have been identified in EMZL. In this review, we will focus on the updated histopathological criteria and the main problems with differential diagnoses in order to aid the diagnostic approach in our routine practice.	2020	07	29	Pathology	Nakamura	Shigeo
31774199	10.15252/embj.2019102030	Paracaspase MALT1 regulates glioma cell survival by controlling endo-lysosome homeostasis.	Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer with a median survival of around 15 months. A potential treatment strategy involves targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC), which constitute a cell autonomous reservoir of aberrant cells able to initiate, maintain, and repopulate the tumor mass. Here, we report that the expression of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue l (MALT1), a protease previously linked to antigen receptor-mediated NF-κB activation and B-cell lymphoma survival, inversely correlates with patient probability of survival. The knockdown of MALT1 largely impaired the expansion of patient-derived stem-like cells in vitro, and this could be recapitulated with pharmacological inhibitors, in vitro and in vivo. Blocking MALT1 protease activity increases the endo-lysosome abundance, impairs autophagic flux, and culminates in lysosomal-mediated cell death, concomitantly with mTOR inactivation and dispersion from endo-lysosomes. These findings place MALT1 as a new druggable target involved in glioblastoma and unveil ways to modulate the homeostasis of endo-lysosomes.	2020	07	13	EMBO J	Jacobs	Kathryn A

31883669	10.1016/j.pathol.2019.09.014	The clinicopathological and genetic features of ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Ovarian lymphoma, whether a primary or secondary condition, is very rare. Little is known about its genetic aberrations. Here, we reviewed the clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of nine ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases and performed fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis to detect MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 translocations. We also performed whole exome sequencing analysis to determine their genomic features compared with those of conventional extranodal DLBCL. The results showed that six of nine cases were bilateral and three cases were left-sided. Histologically, the tumour cells were homogeneous and a starry-sky pattern was very common in ovarian DLBCL (Burkitt-like). Immunohistochemically, most of the cases (7/9) were germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) subtype, and dual expression of MYC and BCL2 was found in three cases of ovarian DLBCL. A double-hit (involving MYC and BCL6) phenotype was found in one case of ovarian DLBCL (GCB subtype). Sequencing analysis revealed that NOTCH4, NCOR2, BCL10 and CARD11 were frequently mutated both in ovarian DLBCL and conventional extranodal DLBCL. COL27A1, PRKCB, HLA-A, NOTCH3 and HDAC4 mutations were found only in ovarian DLBCL but not in conventional DLBCL, and NOTCH3 and HDAC4 mutations were only identified in the GCB subtype. Furthermore, several signalling pathways including the B-cell receptor, Epstein-Barr virus infection, HTLV-1 infection, Notch, PI3K-AKT and mTOR were found to be involved in ovarian DLBCL. Our results broaden the understanding of the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of ovarian DLBCL and compare their genetic features to those of conventional extranodal DLBCL for the first time.	2020	11	16	Pathology	Xu	Hui
31961340	10.1172/JCI97040	GRK2 suppresses lymphomagenesis by inhibiting the MALT1 proto-oncoprotein.	Antigen receptor-dependent (AgR-dependent) stimulation of the NF-κB transcription factor in lymphocytes is a required event during adaptive immune response, but dysregulated activation of this signaling pathway can lead to lymphoma. AgR stimulation promotes assembly of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex, wherein MALT1 acts as (a) a scaffold to recruit components of the canonical NF-κB machinery and (b) a protease to cleave and inactivate specific substrates, including negative regulators of NF-κB. In multiple lymphoma subtypes, malignant B cells hijack AgR signaling pathways to promote their own growth and survival, and inhibiting MALT1 reduces the viability and growth of these tumors. As such, MALT1 has emerged as a potential pharmaceutical target. Here, we identified G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a new MALT1-interacting protein. We demonstrated that GRK2 binds the death domain of MALT1 and inhibits MALT1 scaffolding and proteolytic activities. We found that lower GRK2 levels in activated B cell-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) are associated with reduced survival, and that GRK2 knockdown enhances ABC-DLBCL tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings suggest that GRK2 can function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting MALT1 and provide a roadmap for developing new strategies to inhibit MALT1-dependent lymphomagenesis.	2020	09	15	J Clin Invest	Cheng	Jing
32008135	10.1007/s10875-020-00760-3	Human BCL10 Deficiency due to Homozygosity for a Rare Allele.	In 2014, a child with broad combined immunodeficiency (CID) who was homozygous for a private BCL10 allele was reported to have complete inherited human BCL10 deficiency. In the present study, we report a new BCL10 mutation in another child with CID who was homozygous for a BCL10 variant (R88X), previously reported as a rare allele in heterozygosis (minor allele frequency, 0.000003986). The mutant allele was a loss-of-expression and loss-of-function allele. As with the previously reported patient, this patient had complete BCL10 deficiency. The clinical phenotype shared features, such as respiratory infections, but differed from that of the previous patient that he did not develop significant gastroenteritis episodes or chronic colitis. Cellular and immunological phenotypes were similar to those of the previous patient. TLR4, TLR2/6, and Dectin-1 responses were found to depend on BCL10 in fibroblasts, and final maturation of T cell and B cell maturation into memory cells was affected. Autosomal-recessive BCL10 deficiency should therefore be considered in children with CID.	2021	07	02	J Clin Immunol	Van Den Rym	Ana
32012328	10.1002/hon.2718	High throughput sequencing reveals high specificity of TNFAIP3 mutations in ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas.	The majority of ocular adnexal (OA) lymphomas (OAL) are extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (MZL). First high throughput sequencing (HTS) studies on OA-MZL showed inconsistent results and the distribution of mutations in reactive lymphoid lesions of this anatomic region has not yet been sufficiently addressed. We characterized OAL and lymphoid lesions of the OA by targeted HTS. The study included 34 OA-MZL, 11 chronic conjunctivitis, five mature small cell B-cell lymphomas spreading to the OA, five diseases with increase of IgG4+ plasma cells, three Burkitt lymphomas (BL), three diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), three mantle cell lymphomas, three idiopathic orbital inflammations/orbital pseudo tumors (PT), and three OA lymphoid hyperplasia. All cases were negative for Chlamydia. The mutational number was highest in BL and lowest in PT. The most commonly (and exclusively) mutated gene in OA-MZL was TNFAIP3 (10 of 34 cases). Altogether, 20 out of 34 patients harbored mutually exclusive mutations of either TNFAIP3, BCL10, MYD88, ATM, BRAF, or NFKBIE, or nonexclusive mutations of IRF8, TNFRSF14, KLHL6, and TBL1XR1, all encoding for NK-κB pathway compounds or regulators. Thirteen patients (38%) had, to a great part, mutually exclusive mutations of chromatin modifier-encoding genes: KMT2D, CREBBP, BCL7A, DNMT3A, EP300, or HIST1H1E. Only four patients harbored co-occurring mutations of genes encoding for NK-κB compounds and chromatin modifiers. Finally, PTEN, KMT2D, PRDM1, and HIST1H2BK mutations were observable in reactive lymphoid lesions too, while such instances were devoid of NF-κB compound mutations and/or mutations of acetyltransferase-encoding genes. In conclusion, 80% of OA-MZL display mutations of either NK-κB compounds or chromatin modifiers. Lymphoid lesions of the OA bearing NF-κB compound mutations and/or mutations of acetyltransferase-encoding genes highly likely represent lymphomas.	2020	08	31	Hematol Oncol	Vela	Visar

Caspase recruitment domain containing protein 9 (CARD9) has been demonstrated to be a pro-tumor factor in various cancers. However, our previous study found a significant decrease of CARD9 in malignant pleural effusion compared with benign pleural effusion. So we investigated the role of CARD9 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its working mechanism. Immunohistochemistry, western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of CARD9 in specimens of NSCLC patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databasewas also used to analyze the expression of CARD9 in NSCLC and its predicting value for prognosis. Immunofluorescence was used for CARD9 cellular location. Cell growth assay, clonal formation assay, wound healing assay, matrigel invasion assay, and flow cytometry were used to test cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and cycle progression of NSCLC cells with CARD9 knockdown or CARD9 overexpression. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to identify the interaction between CARD9 and B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10). SB203580 was used to inhibit p38 activation. CARD9 was decreased in NSCLC tissues compared with normal tissues; low CARD9 expression was associated with poor survival. CARD9 was expressed both in tumor cells and macrophages. Downregulation of CARD9 in NSCLC cells enhanced the abilities of proliferation, invasion and migration via activated MAPK/p38 signaling, while overexpression of CARD9 presented antitumor effects. BCL10 was identified to interact with CARD9. We demonstrate that CARD9 is an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC patients and inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion by suppressing MAPK/p38 pathway in NSCLC cells.	2021	03	10	Cancer Res Treat	Pan	Linyue
32179489	10.1016/j.cancergen.2020.02.005	Integrating transcriptome-wide association study and copy number variation study identifies candidate genes and pathways for diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	The genetic basis of diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DNHL) is largely unknown now. We conducted a large-scale transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of DNHL to identify novel candidates for DNHL. The GWAS summary data of DNHL was obtained from the UKBiobank, involving 685 cases and 451,579 controls. TWAS of DNHL was performed using tissue-specific gene expression weights generated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data. The DNHLTWAS results were further validated by a previous published copy number alterations (CNA) study of DNHL. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of identified candidate genes were conducted by the DAVID 6.8. We identified 214 genes with TWAS P value &lt; 0.05 for DNHL, such as MRPL19 (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0010), CRCP (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0010) and SEMA3C (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0010). After further comparing the 214 genes with copy number variations of DNHL patients, we found 1 overlapped gene, BCL10 (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0100). We also detected 6 common GO terms shared between gene set enrichment analysis results of TWAS and CNAs, such as cytosol (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0003, PCNAs = 4.99 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and membrane (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0048, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 0.0046). The pathway enrichment analysis of TWAS and CNAs detected 3 common pathways, including HIF-1 signaling pathway (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0195, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 1.96 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), mTOR signaling pathway (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0242, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 6.75 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and adipocytokine signaling pathway (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0392, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 0.0103). Our study identified multiple DNHL associated genes and pathways, providing novel useful information for the pathogenetic studies of DNHL.	2020	09	21	Cancer Genet	Wu	Di
32343482	10.15252/embr.201949237	MALT1 targeting suppresses CARD14-induced psoriatic dermatitis in mice.	CARD14 gain-of-function mutations cause psoriasis in humans and mice. Together with BCL10 and the protease MALT1, mutant CARD14 forms a signaling node that mediates increased NF-κB signaling and proinflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes. However, it remains unclear whether psoriasis in response to CARD14 hyperactivation is keratinocyte-intrinsic or requires CARD14 signaling in other cells. Moreover, the in vivo effect of MALT1 targeting on mutant CARD14-induced psoriasis has not yet been documented. Here, we show that inducible keratinocyte-specific expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in mice rapidly induces epidermal thickening and inflammation as well as increased expression of several genes associated with psoriasis in humans. Keratinocyte-specific MALT1 deletion as well as oral treatment of mice with a specific MALT1 protease inhibitor strongly reduces psoriatic skin disease in CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> mice. Together, these data illustrate a keratinocyte-intrinsic causal role of enhanced CARD14/MALT1 signaling in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and show the potential of MALT1 inhibition for the treatment of psoriasis.	2021	04	27	EMBO Rep	Van Nuffel	Elien
32388054	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104115	TAK1 lessens the activity of the paracaspase MALT1 during T cell receptor signaling.	The CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex couples antigen receptors to the activation of Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors in T/B lymphocytes. Within this signalosome, the MALT1 paracaspase serves dual roles: it is a crucial adaptor for signal transduction to NF-κB signaling, and a protease that shapes NF-κB activity and lymphocyte activation. Although a subtle choreography of ubiquitination and phosphorylation orchestrate the CBM, how precisely this complex and MALT1 enzyme are regulated continue to be elucidated. Here, we report that the chemical inhibition or the siRNA-based silencing of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a known partner of the CBM complex required for NF-κB activation, enhanced the processing of MALT1 substrates. We further show that the assembly of the CBM as well as the ubiquitination of MALT1 was augmented when TAK1 was inhibited. Thus, TAK1 may initiate a negative feedback loop to finely tune the CBM complex activity.	2021	01	04	Cell Immunol	Nicolau	Carolina Alves
32450431	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104133	The LUBAC participates in lysophosphatidic acid-induced NF-κB activation.	The natural bioactive glycerophospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) binds to its cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface to promote the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-κB. LPA-mediated activation of NF-κB relies on the formation of a signalosome that contains the scaffold CARMA3, the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (CBM complex). The CBM complex has been extensively studied in lymphocytes, where it links antigen receptors to NF-κB activation via the recruitment of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), a tripartite complex of HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN. Moreover, MALT1 cleaves the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 to further enhance NF-κB activation. However, the contribution of the LUBAC downstream of GPCRs has not been investigated. By using murine embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient for HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN, we report that the LUBAC is crucial for the activation of NF-κB in response to LPA. Further echoing the situation in lymphocytes, LPA unbridles the protease activity of MALT1, which cleaves HOIL1 at the Arginine 165. The expression of a MALT1-insensitive version of HOIL1 reveals that this processing is involved in the optimal production of the NF-κB target cytokine interleukin-6. Lastly, we provide evidence that the guanine exchange factor GEF-H1 favors MALT1-mediated cleavage of HOIL1 and NF-κB signaling in this context. Together, our results unveil a critical role for the LUBAC as a positive regulator of NF-κB signaling downstream of LPA receptors.	2021	01	04	Cell Immunol	Douanne	Tiphaine
32574386	10.1111/ejh.13467	MALT-1 as a novel therapeutic target for adult T-cell leukemia.	T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling-induced activation of NF-κB requires assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT-1 complex and IκB kinase (IKK). Gain-of-function alterations in this component of the TCR/NF-κB pathway are associated with the development of HTLV-1-driven adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We aimed to determine whether inhibition of MALT-1-mediated NF-κB activation could have anti-ATL activity. RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to assess expression levels of MALT-1 and the intracellular signaling cascades. Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptotic events were examined using WST-8 assays, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33342 staining. MALT-1 expression was upregulated in ATL-derived T-cell lines compared to that in normal PBMCs and uninfected or HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines. Targeting MALT-1 with siRNA decreased cell proliferation. A MALT-1 inhibitor (MI-2) suppressed cleavage of the MALT-1-target protein, CYLD, and inhibited proliferation via G1 phase arrest. MI-2 induced apoptosis through caspase-3/8/9 activation and inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα, resulting in the accumulation of IκBα and suppression of NF-κB-DNA binding. Additionally, MI-2 inhibited the expression of apoptosis- and cell cycle-related proteins regulated by NF-κB. MALT-1 plays an important regulatory role in NF-κB signaling during ATL-genesis, and targeting MALT-1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease.	2021	07	29	Eur J Haematol	Ishikawa	Chie
32593012	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104147	Regulation and dysregulation of CARD14 signalling and its physiological consequences in inflammatory skin disease.	CARD14 is a scaffold molecule predominantly expressed in keratinocytes and genetic variants in the CARD14 gene confer an increased risk of inflammatory skin disease. Due to its association with common skin diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the biological function of CARD14 is of relevant interest to human health. CARD14 recruits BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 complex, which modulates NF-κB and MAPK signalling pathways, yet little is known about how CARD14 is regulated or activated in the context of the innate immune response and in chronic inflammation. This review summarises the current understanding of the molecular function and regulatory mechanisms of CARD14 and highlights recent findings in human disease and murine mouse models.	2020	11	20	Cell Immunol	Mellett	Mark
32683230	10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126615	Zinc homeostasis plays an important role in the prevention of obesity-induced cardiac inflammation, remodeling and dysfunction.	Obesity often leads to cardiovascular diseases, such as obesity-related cardiac hypertrophy (ORCH), due to chronic cardiac inflammation. Zinc is structurally and functionally essential for many transcription factors, therefore it not only has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress functions, but also has insulin-like function, however, its role in the development of obesity-associated cardiac pathogenesis and the potentially underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the role of zinc homeostasis in the prevention of ORCH. It was recently reported that when four-week old mice were fed either high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet containing deficient, adequate or supplemented zinc, HFD induced obesity and ORCH along with increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and increased expression of B-cell lymphoma/ leukemia 10 (BCL10) and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9). These effects were further aggravated by zinc deficiency and significantly alleviated by zinc supplementation. Mechanistically administration of a p38 MAPK specific inhibitor in HFD-fed mice for 3 months did not affect HFD-induced obesity and increased expression of BCL10 and CARD9, but completely abolished HFD/obesity-induced cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, inhibition of BCL10 expression by siRNA prevented palmitate-induced increased p38 MAPK activation and atrial natriuretic peptide expression. Deletion of metallothionein abolished the protective effect of zinc on palmitate-induced up-regulation of BCL10 and phospho-p38 MAPK. Taken together with other recent studies, we concluded that HFD and zinc deficiency synergistically induce ORCH by increasing oxidative stress-mediated activation of BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK signaling. Zinc supplementation ameliorates ORCH through activation of metallothionein to repress oxidative stress-activated BCL10 expression and p38 MAPK activation.	2021	09	27	J Trace Elem Med Biol	Zhang	Haina
32721634	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104158	Critical protein-protein interactions within the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex: Take-home points for the cell biologist.	The CBM complex, which is composed of the proteins CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1, serves multiple pivotal roles as a mediator of T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor-dependent NF-κB induction and lymphocyte activation. CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 are each proto-oncoproteins and dysregulation of CBM signaling, as a result of somatic gain-of-function mutation or chromosomal translocation, is a hallmark of multiple lymphoid malignancies including Activated B-cell Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. Moreover, loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function germline mutations in CBM complex proteins have been associated with a range of immune dysregulation syndromes. A wealth of detailed structural information has become available over the past decade through meticulous interrogation of the interactions between CBM components. Here, we review key findings regarding the biochemical nature of these protein-protein interactions which have ultimately led the field to a sophisticated understanding of how these proteins assemble into high-order filamentous CBM complexes. To date, approaches to therapeutic inhibition of the CBM complex for the treatment of lymphoid malignancy and/or auto-immunity have focused on blocking MALT1 protease function. We also review key studies relating to the structural impact of MALT1 protease inhibitors on key protein-protein interactions.	2021	03	09	Cell Immunol	Cheng	Jing
32768663	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104161	Bcl10 is associated with actin dynamics at the T cell immune synapse.	T cell responses to antigen are initiated by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)<sup>1</sup>, leading to activation of diverse signaling cascades, including an incompletely defined pathway that triggers rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Defects in the control of actin dynamics and organization are associated with several human immunodeficiency diseases, emphasizing the importance of cytoskeletal remodeling in the functioning of the adaptive immune system. Here, we investigate the role of the adaptor protein Bcl10<sup>2</sup> in the control of actin dynamics. Although Bcl10 is primarily known as a component of the pathway connecting the TCR to activation of the NF-κB<sup>3</sup> transcription factor, a few studies have implicated Bcl10 in antigen receptor-dependent control of actin polymerization and F-actin-dependent functional responses. However, the role of Bcl10 in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics remains largely undefined. To investigate the contribution of Bcl10 in the regulation of TCR-dependent cytoskeletal dynamics, we monitored actin dynamics at the immune synapse of primary murine CD8 effector T cells. Quantification of these dynamics reveals two distinct temporal phases distinguished by differences in speed and directionality. Our results indicate that effector CD8 T cells lacking Bcl10 display faster actin flows and more dynamic lamellipodia, compared to wild-type cells. These studies define a role for Bcl10 in TCR-dependent actin dynamics, emphasizing that Bcl10 has important cytoskeleton-directed functions that are likely independent of its role in transmission of NF-κB -activating signals.	2021	03	09	Cell Immunol	Wagh	Kaustubh

33052237	10.7150/thno.47533	Targeting BCL10 by small peptides for the treatment of B cell lymphoma.	<b>Rationale:</b> Constitutive activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs), the most aggressive and chemoresistant form of DLBCL. In ABC-DLBCLs, the CARMA1-BCL10 (CB) complex forms a filamentous structure and functions as a supramolecular organizing centre (CB-SMOC) that is required for constitutive NF-κB activation, making it an attractive drug target for ABC-DLBCL treatment. However, a pharmaceutical approach targeting CB-SMOC has been lacking. Here, we developed Bcl10 peptide inhibitors (BPIs) that specifically target the BCL10 filamentation process. <b>Methods:</b> Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging were used to visualize the effect of the BPIs on the BCL10 filamentation process. The cytotoxicity of the tested BPIs was evaluated in DLBCL cell lines according to cell proliferation assays. Different <i>in vitro</i> experiments (pharmacokinetics, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, annexin V and PI staining) were conducted to determine the functional mechanisms of the BPIs. The <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic effect of the BPIs was examined in different xenograft DLBCL mouse models. Finally, Ki67 and TUNEL staining and histopathology analysis were used to evaluate the antineoplastic mechanisms and systemic toxicity of the BPIs. <b>Results:</b> We showed that these BPIs can effectively disrupt the BCL10 filamentation process, destabilize BCL10 and suppress NF-κB signalling in ABC-DLBCL cells. By examining a panel of DLBCL cell lines, we found that these BPIs selectively repressed the growth of CB-SMOC-dependent DLBCL cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, by converting the BPIs to acquire a D-retro inverso (DRI) configuration, we developed DRI-BPIs with significantly improved intracellular stability and unimpaired BPI activity. These DRI-BPIs selectively repressed the growth of CB-SMOC-dependent DLBCL tumors in mouse xenograft models without eliciting discernible adverse effects. <b>Conclusion:</b> We developed novel BPIs to target the BCL10 filamentation process and demonstrated that targeting BCL10 by BPIs is a potentially safe and effective pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of ABC-DLBCL and other CB-SMOC-dependent malignancies.	2021	06	01	Theranostics	Bao	Wei
33202260	10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.10.015	Multiplexed Functional Assessment of Genetic Variants in CARD11.	Genetic testing has increased the number of variants identified in disease genes, but the diagnostic utility is limited by lack of understanding variant function. CARD11 encodes an adaptor protein that expresses dominant-negative and gain-of-function variants associated with distinct immunodeficiencies. Here, we used a ""cloning-free"" saturation genome editing approach in a diploid cell line to simultaneously score 2,542 variants for decreased or increased function in the region of CARD11 associated with immunodeficiency. We also described an exon-skipping mechanism for CARD11 dominant-negative activity. The classification of reported clinical variants was sensitive (94.6%) and specific (88.9%), which rendered the data immediately useful for interpretation of seven coding and splicing variants implicated in immunodeficiency found in our clinic. This approach is generalizable for variant interpretation in many other clinically actionable genes, in any relevant cell type.	2021	01	12	Am J Hum Genet	Meitlis	Iana
33297339	10.3390/nu12123755	Gene Expression Alterations Associated with Oleuropein-Induced Antiproliferative Effects and S-Phase Cell Cycle Arrest in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.	It is known that the Mediterranean diet is effective in reducing the risk of several chronic diseases, including cancer. A critical component of the Mediterranean diet is olive oil, and the relationship between olive oil consumption and the reduced risk of cancer has been established. Oleuropein (OL) is the most prominent polyphenol component of olive fruits and leaves. This compound has been shown to have potent properties in various types of cancers, including breast cancer. In the present study, the molecular mechanism of OL was examined in two racially different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines-African American (AA, MDA-MB-468) and Caucasian American (CA, MDA-MB-231). The data obtained showed that OL effectively inhibits cell growth in both cell lines, concomitant with S-phase cell cycle arrest-mediated apoptosis. The results also showed that OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells were two-fold more sensitive to OL antiproliferative effect than MDA-MB-231 cells were. At lower concentrations, OL modified the expression of many apoptosis-involved genes. OL was more effective in MDA-MB-468, compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, in terms of the number and the fold-change of the altered genes. In MDA-MB-468 cells, OL induced a noticeable transcription activation in fourteen genes, including two members of the caspase family: caspase 1 (<i>CASP1</i>) and caspase 14 (<i>CASP14</i>); two members of the TNF receptor superfamily: Fas-associated via death domain (<i>FADD</i>) and TNF receptor superfamily 21 (<i>TNFRSF21</i>); six other proapoptotic genes: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (<i>GADD45A</i>), cytochrome c somatic (<i>CYCS</i>), BCL-2 interacting protein 2 (<i>BNIP2</i>), BCL-2 interacting protein 3 (<i>BNIP3</i>), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (<i>BID</i>), and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (<i>BCL10</i>); and the CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (<i>CFLAR</i>) gene. Moreover, in MDA-MB-468 cells, OL induced a significant upregulation in two antiapoptotic genes: bifunctional apoptosis regulator (<i>BFAR</i>) and B-Raf proto-oncogene (<i>BRAF</i>) and a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat-containing 3 (<i>BIRC3</i>). On the contrary, in MDA-MB-231 cells, OL showed mixed impacts on gene expression. OL significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of four genes: <i>BIRC3</i>, receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (<i>RIPK2</i>), TNF receptor superfamily 10A (<i>TNFRSF10A</i>), and caspase 4 (<i>CASP4</i>). Additionally, another four genes were repressed, including caspase 6 (<i>CASP6</i>), pyrin domain (PYD), and caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing (<i>PAYCARD</i>), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (<i>BIRC5</i>), and the most downregulated TNF receptor superfamily member 11B (<i>TNFRSF11B</i>, 16.34-fold). In conclusion, the data obtained indicate that the two cell lines were markedly different in the anticancer effect and mechanisms of oleuropein's ability to alter apoptosis-related gene expressions. The results obtained from this study should also guide the potential utilization of oleuropein as an adjunct therapy for TNBC to increase chemotherapy effectiveness and prevent cancer progression.	2021	04	27	Nutrients	Messeha	Samia S
33329596	10.3389/fimmu.2020.601926	Cellular and Mathematical Analyses of LUBAC Involvement in T Cell Receptor-Mediated NF-κB Activation Pathway.	The LUBAC ubiquitin ligase complex, composed of the HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN subunits, stimulates the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathways through its Met1-linked linear ubiquitination activity. Here we performed cellular and mathematical modeling analyses of the LUBAC involvement in the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated NF-κB activation pathway, using the Jurkat human T cell line. LUBAC is indispensable for TCR-induced NF-κB and T cell activation, and transiently associates with and linearly ubiquitinates the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, through the catalytic HOIP subunit. In contrast, the linear ubiquitination of NEMO, a substrate of the TNF-α-induced canonical NF-κB activation pathway, was limited during the TCR pathway. Among deubiquitinases, OTULIN, but not CYLD, plays a major role in downregulating LUBAC-mediated TCR signaling. Mathematical modeling indicated that linear ubiquitination of the CBM complex accelerates the activation of IκB kinase (IKK), as compared with the activity induced by linear ubiquitination of NEMO alone. Moreover, simulations of the sequential linear ubiquitination of the CBM complex suggested that the allosteric regulation of linear (de)ubiquitination of CBM subunits is controlled by the ubiquitin-linkage lengths. These results indicated that, unlike the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation pathway, the TCR-mediated NF-κB activation in T lymphocytes has a characteristic mechanism to induce LUBAC-mediated NF-κB activation.	2021	06	21	Front Immunol	Oikawa	Daisuke
30514565	10.1016/j.cellimm.2018.11.001	Ubiquitination and phosphorylation of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome in T cells.	Antigen receptor-induced signaling plays an important role in inflammation and immunity. Formation of a CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex is a key event in T- and B cell receptor-induced gene expression by regulating NF-κB activation and mRNA stability. Deregulated CARD11, BCL10 or MALT1 expression or CBM signaling have been associated with immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and cancer, indicating that CBM formation and function have to be tightly regulated. Over the past years great progress has been made in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of the CBM complex. In this context, several posttranslational modifications play an indispensable role in regulating CBM function and downstream signal transduction. In this review we summarize how the different CBM components as well as their interplay are regulated by protein ubiquitination and phosphorylation in the context of T cell receptor signaling.	2020	04	08	Cell Immunol	Lork	Marie

30773504	10.5582/bst.2018.01291	By regulating miR-182-5p/BCL10/CYCS, sufentanil reduces the apoptosis of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells caused by ropivacaine.	Sufentanil is a type of opioid analgesic and is usually used to facilitate painless labor in combination with the local anesthetic ropivacaine. One aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of sufentanil and ropivacaine on umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs). A second aim of this study was to determine whether sufentanil attenuated the cytotoxicity of ropivacaine in vitro. UCMSCs were divided into 3 groups: one was treated with ropivacaine at a concentration of 50, 100, 200, or 400 μg/mL, another was treated with sufentanil at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 nmol/L, and a third was treated with a combination of ropivacaine at a concentration of 200 μg/mL and sufentanil at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 nmol/L. Results indicated that cell proliferation decreased in cells treated with ropivacaine while it increased in cells treated with sufentanil. In addition, sufentanil limited the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on UCMSC growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Combined treatment with ropivacaine at a concentration of 200 μg/mL and sufentanil at a concentration of 500 nmol/L decreased the proportion of dead and apoptotic UCMSCs, and fewer cells were arrested in the S phase compared to cells treated with ropivacaine. Sufentanil inhibited the apoptosis induced by ropivacaine by increasing miR-182-5p, which regulated the expression of mRNA of the pro-apoptotic genes B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) and cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS). Sufentanil also increased the expression of mRNA of anti-apoptotic genes. In short, ropivacaine inhibits the cell viability and induces the apoptosis of UCMSCs in vitro while sufentanil attenuates this apoptosis by regulating miR182-5p/BCL10/CYCS.	2019	06	28	Biosci Trends	Li	Lisha
31047877	10.1016/j.cca.2019.04.077	BCL10 in cell survival after DNA damage.	The complex defense mechanism of the DNA damage response (DDR) developed by cells during long-term evolution is an important mechanism for maintaining the stability of the genome. Defects in the DDR pathway can lead to the occurrence of various diseases, including tumor development. Most cancer treatments cause DNA damage and apoptosis. However, cancer cells have the natural ability to repair this damage and inhibit apoptosis, ultimately leading to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, investigating the mechanism of DNA damage may contribute markedly to the future treatment of cancer. The CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex formed by B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) regulates apoptosis by activating NF-κB signaling. BCL10 is involved in the formation of complexes that antagonize apoptosis and contribute to cell survival after DNA damage, with cytoplasmic BCL10 entering the nucleus to promote DNA damage repair, including histone ubiquitination and the recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) repair factors. This article reviews the role of BCL10 in cell survival following DNA damage.	2019	12	11	Clin Chim Acta	Luo	Yichen

Gastric mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) are infrequently encountered in routine practice. Some gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) have a variety of differentiation patterns; however, pancreatic acinar differentiation in gastric NECs is rare. The molecular abnormalities of NECs with pancreatic acinar differentiation are not well understood. A 67-year-old male with a gastric MiNEN with pancreatic acinar differentiation without any symptoms. The tumor consisted of two components, including both glandular and solid histological features. Although the former component was a common type of adenocarcinoma, the latter showed endocrine differentiation and expressed pancreatic acinar enzymes immunohistochemically. A positive signal with the anti-BCL10 antibody, which detects one of the pancreatic acinar enzymes, was also present specifically in the latter component. We also examined TP53 genomic mutations, DNA methylation status, and allelic imbalance (AI), which is an indicator of tumor aggressiveness. Although both components of this tumor showed no genomic mutation and a low methylation epigenotype, the frequency of AI was higher in the acinar-endocrine component than in the adenocarcinomatous component. The finding of AI indicated the progression of the conventional adenocarcinoma to an acinar-endocrine component and identified the aggressive potential of the acinar-endocrine component. We report a rare case of gastric MiNEN with pancreatic acinar differentiation. AI analysis revealed tumor progression and aggressiveness. In addition, the usefulness of the anti-BCL10 antibody for detecting the acinar-endocrine component was suggested.	2019	11	25	Diagn Pathol	Fujita	Yasuko
31092922	10.1038/s41586-019-1215-2	Targeting the CBM complex causes T<sub>reg</sub> cells to prime tumours for immune checkpoint therapy.	Solid tumours are infiltrated by effector T cells with the potential to control or reject them, as well as by regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells that restrict the function of effector T cells and thereby promote tumour growth<sup>1</sup>. The anti-tumour activity of effector T cells can be therapeutically unleashed, and is now being exploited for the treatment of some forms of human cancer. However, weak tumour-associated inflammatory responses and the immune-suppressive function of T<sub>reg</sub> cells remain major hurdles to broader effectiveness of tumour immunotherapy<sup>2</sup>. Here we show that, after disruption of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex, most tumour-infiltrating T<sub>reg</sub> cells produce IFNγ, resulting in stunted tumour growth. Notably, genetic deletion of both or even just one allele of CARMA1 (also known as Card11) in only a fraction of T<sub>reg</sub> cells-which avoided systemic autoimmunity-was sufficient to produce this anti-tumour effect, showing that it is not the mere loss of suppressive function but the gain of effector activity by T<sub>reg</sub> cells that initiates tumour control. The production of IFNγ by T<sub>reg</sub> cells was accompanied by activation of macrophages and upregulation of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex on tumour cells. However, tumour cells also upregulated the expression of PD-L1, which indicates activation of adaptive immune resistance<sup>3</sup>. Consequently, blockade of PD-1 together with CARMA1 deletion caused rejection of tumours that otherwise do not respond to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. This effect was reproduced by pharmacological inhibition of the CBM protein MALT1. Our results demonstrate that partial disruption of the CBM complex and induction of IFNγ secretion in the preferentially self-reactive T<sub>reg</sub> cell pool does not cause systemic autoimmunity but is sufficient to prime the tumour environment for successful immune checkpoint therapy.	2019	09	17	Nature	Di Pilato	Mauro
31138793	10.1038/s41467-019-10203-2	Bcl10-controlled Malt1 paracaspase activity is key for the immune suppressive function of regulatory T cells.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have crucial functions in the inhibition of immune responses. Their development and suppressive functions are controlled by the T cell receptor (TCR), but the TCR signaling mechanisms that mediate these effects remain ill-defined. Here we show that CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling mediates TCR-induced NF-κB activation in Tregs and controls the conversion of resting Tregs to effector Tregs under homeostatic conditions. However, in inflammatory milieus, cytokines can bypass the CBM requirement for this differentiation step. By contrast, CBM signaling, in a MALT1 protease-dependent manner, is essential for mediating the suppressive function of Tregs. In malignant melanoma models, acute genetic blockade of BCL10 signaling selectively in Tregs or pharmacological MALT1 inhibition enhances anti-tumor immune responses. Together, our data uncover a segregation of Treg differentiation and suppressive function at the CBM complex level, and provide a rationale to explore MALT1 inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy.	2019	06	17	Nat Commun	Rosenbaum	Marc
31178130	10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.004	ZNF436 promotes tumor cell proliferation through transcriptional activation of BCL10 in glioma.	Transcriptional factors (TFs) are key regulators in orchestrating gene transcription during cancer development. However, their roles in glioma remain elusive. Here, we analyzed the differential expression of TFs and identified ZNF436 is upregulated in glioblastoma and Lower Grade Glioma patients. High expression of ZNF436 is positively associated with poor overall survival and regulated by CREB1 in glioma cells. Knockdown of ZNF436 significantly abolished glioma cells proliferation in vitro. RNA sequencing revealed that ZNF436 regulates cell cycle and controlling BCL10 expression. Overexpression of BCL10 promoted glioma cells growth and rescued the malignant behavior in ZNF436-knockdown cells. High levels of BCL10 also result in a worse prognosis in glioma patients. Taken together, our findings identify the CREB1/ZNF436/BCL10 axis represents a novel, potential therapeutic target for glioma interventions.	2020	07	06	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Shang	Yinwu
31179345	10.1155/2019/9582714	Distinct Effects of Carrageenan and High-Fat Consumption on the Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance in Nonobese and Obese Models of Type 2 Diabetes.	Exposure to low concentration of the common food additive carrageenan (10 mg/L) for only six days led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the C57BL/6J mouse. Longer exposure produced fasting hyperglycemia but with no increase in weight, in contrast to the HFD. Glucose intolerance was attributable to carrageenan-induced inflammation and to increased expression of GRB10. Both HFD and carrageenan increased p(Ser32)-I<i>κ</i>B<i>α</i> and p(Ser307)-IRS1, and the increases were greater following the combined exposure. The effects of carrageenan were inhibited by the combination of the free radical inhibitor Tempol and BCL10 siRNA, which had no impact on the HFD-mediated increase. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin blocked the HFD-induced increases, without an effect on the carrageenan-mediated effects. HFD had no impact on the expression of GRB10. Both carrageenan and high fat increased hepatic infiltration by F4/80-positive macrophages. Serum galectin-3 and galectin-3 binding to the insulin receptor increased by carrageenan and by HFD. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor declined following either exposure and was further reduced by their combination. Carrageenan reduced the activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB; arylsulfatase B), which was unchanged following HFD. Dietary exposure to both high fat and carrageenan can impair insulin signaling through both similar and distinct mechanisms.	2020	01	13	J Diabetes Res	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
31296852	10.1038/s41467-019-10953-z	Structures of autoinhibited and polymerized forms of CARD9 reveal mechanisms of CARD9 and CARD11 activation.	CARD9 and CARD11 drive immune cell activation by nucleating Bcl10 polymerization, but are held in an autoinhibited state prior to stimulation. Here, we elucidate the structural basis for this autoinhibition by determining the structure of a region of CARD9 that includes an extensive interface between its caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and coiled-coil domain. We demonstrate, for both CARD9 and CARD11, that disruption of this interface leads to hyperactivation in cells and to the formation of Bcl10-templating filaments in vitro, illuminating the mechanism of action of numerous oncogenic mutations of CARD11. These structural insights enable us to characterize two similar, yet distinct, mechanisms by which autoinhibition is relieved in the course of canonical CARD9 or CARD11 activation. We also dissect the molecular determinants of helical template assembly by solving the structure of the CARD9 filament. Taken together, these findings delineate the structural mechanisms of inhibition and activation within this protein family.	2019	10	25	Nat Commun	Holliday	Michael J
31391255	10.1074/jbc.RA119.009551	Coordinated regulation of scaffold opening and enzymatic activity during CARD11 signaling.	The activation of key signaling pathways downstream of antigen receptor engagement is critically required for normal lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. CARD11 is a multidomain signaling scaffold protein required for antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and mTOR. Germline mutations in the <i>CARD11</i> gene result in at least four types of primary immunodeficiency, and somatic <i>CARD11</i> gain-of-function mutations drive constitutive NF-κB activity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and other lymphoid cancers. In response to antigen receptor triggering, CARD11 transitions from a closed, inactive state to an open, active scaffold that recruits multiple signaling partners into a complex to relay downstream signaling. However, how this signal-induced CARD11 conversion occurs remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of Inducible Element 1 (IE1), a short regulatory element in the CARD11 Inhibitory Domain, in the CARD11 signaling cycle. We find that IE1 controls the signal-dependent Opening Step that makes CARD11 accessible to the binding of cofactors, including Bcl10, MALT1, and the HOIP catalytic subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. Surprisingly, we find that IE1 is also required at an independent step for the maximal activation of HOIP and MALT1 enzymatic activity after cofactor recruitment to CARD11. This role of IE1 reveals that there is an Enzymatic Activation Step in the CARD11 signaling cycle that is distinct from the Cofactor Association Step. Our results indicate that CARD11 has evolved to actively coordinate scaffold opening and the induction of enzymatic activity among recruited cofactors during antigen receptor signaling.	2020	05	06	J Biol Chem	Wang	Zhaoquan
31420608	10.1038/s41388-019-0958-4	MALT1 is a critical mediator of PAR1-driven NF-κB activation and metastasis in multiple tumor types.	Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a thrombin-responsive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is implicated in promoting metastasis in multiple tumor types, including both sarcomas and carcinomas, but the molecular mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown. We previously discovered that PAR1 stimulation in endothelial cells leads to activation of NF-κB, mediated by a protein complex comprised of CARMA3, Bcl10, and the MALT1 effector protein (CBM complex). Given the strong association between NF-κB and metastasis, we hypothesized that this CBM complex could play a critical role in the PAR1-driven metastatic progression of specific solid tumors. In support of our hypothesis, we demonstrate that PAR1 stimulation results in NF-κB activation in both osteosarcoma and breast cancer, which is suppressed by siRNA-mediated MALT1 knockdown, suggesting that an intact CBM complex is required for the response in both tumor cell types. We identify several metastasis-associated genes that are upregulated in a MALT1-dependent manner after PAR1 stimulation in cancer cells, including those encoding the matrix remodeling protein, MMP9, and the cytokines, IL-1β and IL-8. Further, exogenous expression of PAR1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells confers highly invasive and metastatic behavior which can be blocked by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated MALT1 knockout. Importantly, we find that PAR1 stimulation induces MALT1 protease activity in both osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells, an activity that is mechanistically linked to NF-κB activation and potentially other responses associated with aggressive phenotype. Several small molecule MALT1 protease inhibitors have recently been described that could therefore represent promising new therapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of PAR1-driven tumor metastasis.	2020	03	11	Oncogene	McAuley	J Randall
31427546		Characterisation of immunogenotypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with variable clinical outcomes. The immunogenotypic features of this heterogeneous disease in Malaysia were not well characterized. In total 141 local series of DLBCL cases from UKM Medical Centre were retrospectively studied. Of these cases, we classified our patients into two subtypes: 32.7% (37/113) GCB and non-GCB 67.3% (76/113) by Hans algorithm and the results showed strong agreement with the results by Choi algorithm (κ = 0.828, P&lt;0.001). Survival analysis indicated significant difference in between GCB and non-GCB subtypes (P=0.01), elevated serum LDH (P=0.016), age more than 60-year-old (P=0.021) and the presence of B symptoms (P=0.04). We observed 12% DLBCL cases were CD5 positive and 81.8% of them died of the disease (P=0.076). Analysis on the dual expression of MYC/BCL2 revealed that there is no significant difference in DE and non-DE groups (P=0.916). FISH study reported there were 9.22% (13/141) rearranged cases observed in our population at which highest frequency of BCL6 gene rearrangement (76.9%), followed by MYC (15.4%) and BCL2 (7.7%); no BCL10 and MALT-1 gene rearrangement found regardless of using TMAs or whole tissue samples. More cases of MYC protein overexpression observed compared to MYC translocation. Relatively lower frequency of GCB tumours and low gene rearrangement rates were observed in Malaysian population. A national study is therefore warranted to know better the immunogenotypic characteristics of DLBCL in Malaysia and their implications on the survival.	2020	01	31	Malays J Pathol	Phang	K C
31554683	10.1128/JVI.01499-19	Host CARD11 Inhibits Newcastle Disease Virus Replication by Suppressing Viral Polymerase Activity in Neurons.	Host factors play multiple essential roles in the replication and pathogenesis of mammalian neurotropic viruses. However, the cellular proteins of the central nervous system (CNS) involved in avian neurotropic virus infection have not been completely elucidated. Here, we employed a gene microarray to identify caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11), a lymphoma-associated scaffold protein presenting brain-specific upregulated expression in a virulent neurotropic Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-infected natural host. Chicken primary neuronal cells infected with NDV appeared slightly syncytial and died quickly. CARD11 overexpression inhibited viral replication and delayed cytopathic effects; conversely, depletion of CARD11 enhanced viral replication and cytopathic effects in chicken primary neuronal cells. The inhibition of viral replication by CARD11 could not be blocked with CARD11-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome and NF-κB signaling inhibitors. CARD11 was found to interact directly with the viral phosphoprotein (P) through its CC1 domain and the X domain of P; this X domain also mediated the interaction between P and the viral large polymerase protein (L). The CARD11 CC1 domain and L competitively bound to P via the X domain that hindered the P-L interaction of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, resulting in a reduction of viral polymerase activity in a minigenome assay and inhibition of viral replication. Animal experiments further revealed that CARD11 contributed to viral replication inhibition and neuropathology in infected chicken brains. Taken together, our findings identify CARD11 as a brain-specific antiviral factor of NDV infection in avian species.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially impacts the poultry industry worldwide and causes viral encephalitis and neurological disorders leading to brain damage, paralysis, and death. The mechanism of interaction between this neurotropic virus and the avian central nervous system (CNS) is largely unknown. Here, we report that host protein CARD11 presented brain-specific upregulated expression that inhibited NDV replication, which was not due to CARD11-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex-triggered activation of its downstream signaling pathways. The inhibitory mechanism of viral replication is through the CARD11 CC1 domain, and the viral large polymerase protein (L) competitively interacts with the X domain of the viral phosphoprotein (P), which hampers the P-L interaction, suppressing the viral polymerase activity and viral replication. An <i>in vivo</i> study indicated that CARD11 alleviated neuropathological lesions and reduced viral replication in chicken brains. These results provide insight into the interaction between NDV infection and the host defense in the CNS and a potential antiviral target for viral neural diseases.	2020	06	04	J Virol	Wang	Wenbin
31644910	10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.040	MALT1 Phosphorylation Controls Activation of T Lymphocytes and Survival of ABC-DLBCL Tumor Cells.	The CARMA1/CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex bridges T and B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) ligation to MALT1 protease activation and canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Using unbiased mass spectrometry, we discover multiple serine phosphorylation sites in the MALT1 C terminus after T cell activation. Phospho-specific antibodies reveal that CBM-associated MALT1 is transiently hyper-phosphorylated upon TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. We identify a dual role for CK1α as a kinase that is essential for CBM signalosome assembly as well as MALT1 phosphorylation. Although MALT1 phosphorylation is largely dispensable for protease activity, it fosters canonical NF-κB signaling in Jurkat and murine CD4 T cells. Moreover, constitutive MALT1 phosphorylation promotes survival of activated B cell-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells addicted to chronic BCR signaling. Thus, MALT1 phosphorylation triggers optimal NF-κB activation in lymphocytes and survival of lymphoma cells.	2020	09	16	Cell Rep	Gehring	Torben
31658764	10.3390/ijms20205022	B-Cell Activating Factor Enhances Hepatocyte-Driven Angiogenesis via B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 10/Nuclear Factor-KappaB Signaling during Liver Regeneration.	B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is found to be associated with the histological severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). BAFF was also found to have a protective role in hepatic steatosis via down regulating the expression of steatogenesis genes and enhancing steatosis in hepatocytes through BAFF-R. However, the roles of BAFF during liver regeneration are not well defined. In this study, C57/B6 mice with 70% partial hepatectomy were used as a liver regeneration model. BAFF expression was determined by enzyme immunoassay, and anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies were administered to confirm the effects of BAFF on liver regeneration. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and florescence staining determined the expression of B-cell CCL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10). The angiogenesis promoting capability was evaluated after the transfection of cells with siRNA targeting BCL10 expression, and the role of NF-κB was assessed. The results revealed that the BAFF and BCL10 levels were upregulated after partial hepatectomy. Treatment with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies caused death in mice that were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy within 72 h. In vitro, recombinant BAFF protein did not enhance hepatocyte proliferation; however, transfection with BCL10 siRNA arrested hepatocytes at the G2/M phase. Interestingly, conditioned medium from BAFF-treated hepatocytes enhanced angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) proteins were upregulated by BAFF through BCL10/NF-κB signaling. In mice that were treated with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies, the microvessel density (MVD) of the remaining liver tissues and liver regeneration were both reduced. Taken together, our study demonstrated that an increased expression of BAFF and activation of BCL10/NF-κB signaling were involved in hepatocyte-driven angiogenesis and survival during liver regeneration.	2020	03	31	Int J Mol Sci	Chou	Chia-Hung
28886618	10.1111/cmi.12788	Bcl10 synergistically links CEACAM3 and TLR-dependent inflammatory signalling.	The neutrophil-specific innate immune receptor CEACAM3 functions as a decoy to capture Gram-negative pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, that exploit CEACAM family members to adhere to the epithelium. Bacterial binding to CEACAM3 results in their efficient engulfment and triggers activation of an nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-dependent inflammatory response by human neutrophils. Herein, we report that CEACAM3 cross-linking is not sufficient for induction of cytokine production and show that the inflammatory response induced by Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is elicited by an integration of signals from CEACAM3 and toll-like receptors. Using neutrophils from a human CEACAM-expressing mouse line (CEABAC), we use a genetic approach to reveal a molecular bifurcation of the CEACAM3-mediated antimicrobial and inflammatory responses. Ex vivo experiments with CEABAC-Rac2<sup>-/-</sup> , CEABAC-Bcl10<sup>-/-</sup> , and CEABAC-Malt1<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils indicate that these effectors are not necessary for gonococcal engulfment, yet all 3 effectors contribute to CEACAM3-mediated cytokine production. Interestingly, although Bcl10 and Malt1 are often inextricably linked, Bcl10 enabled synergy between toll-like receptor 4 and CEACAM3, whereas Malt1 did not. Together, these findings reveal an integration of the specific innate immune receptor CEACAM3 into the network of more conventional pattern recognition receptors, providing a mechanism by which the innate immune system can unleash its response to a relentless pathogen.	2018	08	01	Cell Microbiol	Sintsova	Anna
29259013	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1089	The CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 Signalosome Drives NFκB Activation and Promotes Aggressiveness in Angiotensin II Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.	The angiotensin II receptor AGTR1, which mediates vasoconstrictive and inflammatory signaling in vascular disease, is overexpressed aberrantly in some breast cancers. In this study, we established the significance of an AGTR1-responsive NFκB signaling pathway in this breast cancer subset. We documented that AGTR1 overexpression occurred in the luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer, was mutually exclusive of HER2 expression, and correlated with aggressive features that include increased lymph node metastasis, reduced responsiveness to neoadjuvant therapy, and reduced overall survival. Mechanistically, AGTR1 overexpression directed both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activation of NFκB, mediated by a signaling pathway that requires the triad of CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1 (CBM signalosome). Activation of this pathway drove cancer cell-intrinsic responses that include proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, CBM-dependent activation of NFκB elicited cancer cell-extrinsic effects, impacting endothelial cells of the tumor microenvironment to promote tumor angiogenesis. CBM/NFκB signaling in AGTR1<sup>+</sup> breast cancer therefore conspires to promote aggressive behavior through pleiotropic effects. Overall, our results point to the prognostic and therapeutic value of identifying AGTR1 overexpression in a subset of HER2-negative breast cancers, and they provide a mechanistic rationale to explore the repurposing of drugs that target angiotensin II-dependent NFκB signaling pathways to improve the treatment of this breast cancer subset.<b>Significance:</b> These findings offer a mechanistic rationale to explore the repurposing of drugs that target angiotensin action to improve the treatment of AGTR1-expressing breast cancers. <i>Cancer Res; 78(5); 1225-40. ©2017 AACR</i>.	2019	01	16	Cancer Res	Ekambaram	Prasanna
29358699	10.1038/s41598-018-19822-z	GSK3β modulates NF-κB activation and RelB degradation through site-specific phosphorylation of BCL10.	Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of various cellular functions, such as energy homoeostasis, cell growth and developmental processes. More recently, GSK3β has been identified as a part of a protein complex involved in the regulation of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex (CBM complex) formation, which is a key signalling event upon antigen receptor engagement of B and T cells, required for the activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways. However, conflicting reports have been published regarding the role of GSK3β for the activation of the NF-κB signalling pathways. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of GSK3β on the NF-κB signalling induced upon T cell activation. Blocking GSK3β by either pharmacologic inhibitors (SB216763 and SB415286) or by RNAi caused a reduced proteolysis of the MALT1 targets CYLD1, BCL10 and RelB as well as diminished IκBα degradation, NF-κB DNA binding and NF-κB activity. This negative effect on NF-κB appears to be due to a diminished CBM complex formation caused by a reduced BCL10 phosphorylation. Taken together, we provide here evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism by which GSK3β affects NF-κB signalling in activated T cells.	2018	12	11	Sci Rep	Abd-Ellah	Ali
29382759	10.1073/pnas.1721967115	Assembly mechanism of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6 signalosome.	The CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome is a central mediator of T cell receptor and B cell receptor-induced NF-κB signaling that regulates multiple lymphocyte functions. While caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein 1 (CARMA1) nucleates B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) filament formation through interactions between CARDs, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a paracaspase with structural similarity to caspases, which recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) for K63-linked polyubiquitination. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the BCL10 CARD filament at 4.0-Å resolution. The structure redefines CARD-CARD interactions compared with the previous EM structure determined from a negatively stained sample. Surprisingly, time-lapse confocal imaging shows that BCL10 polymerizes in a unidirectional manner. CARMA1, the BCL10 nucleator, serves as a hub for formation of star-shaped filamentous networks of BCL10 and significantly decreases the lag period of BCL10 polymerization. Cooperative MALT1 interaction with BCL10 filaments observed under EM suggests immediate dimerization of MALT1 in the BCL10 filamentous scaffold. In addition, TRAF6 cooperatively decorates CBM filaments to form higher-order assemblies, likely resulting in all-or-none activation of the downstream pathway. Collectively, these data reveal biophysical mechanisms in the assembly of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6 complex for signal transduction.	2018	07	20	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	David	Liron
29649481	10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.057	Role of IκB kinase β in regulating the remodeling of the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex.	The current work investigates the notion that inducible clustering of signaling mediators of the IKK pathway is important for platelet activation. Thus, while the CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 (CBM) complex is essential for triggering IKK/NF-κB activation upon platelet stimulation, the signals that elicit its formation and downstream effector activation remain elusive. We demonstrate herein that IKKβ is involved in membrane fusion, and serves as a critical protein kinase required for initial formation and the regulation of the CARMA1/MALT1/Bcl10/CBM complex in platelets. We also show that IKKβ regulates these processes via modulation of phosphorylation of Bcl10 and IKKγ polyubiquitination. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IKKβ regulates membrane fusion and the remodeling of the CBM complex formation.	2018	09	19	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Karim	Zubair A

Gastric extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is a distinct entity in that Helicobacter pylori infection plays the most important causative role in the development of the disease. To investigate the genomic alteration in gastric marginal zone lymphoma that was resistant to the H. pylori eradication therapy, we analyzed 19 cases of the gastric marginal zone lymphoma using fluorescence in situ hybridization for MALT1, BCL10 rearrangement, and targeted sequencing using an Illumina platform. Major genetic alterations affected genes involved in nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway activation and included MALT1 rearrangement (39%), and somatic mutations of TRAF3 (21%), TNFAIP3 (16%), and NOTCH1 (16%). In the MALT1 rearrangement-negative group, disruptive somatic mutations of TRAF3 were the most common alterations (4/12, 33%), followed by somatic mutations of TNFAIP3 (3/12, 25%), and NOTCH1 (3/12, 25%). The present study confirms that genes involved in activation of NF-κB-signaling pathways are a major driver in oncogenesis of H. pylori eradication-resistant gastric marginal zone lymphoma and revealed that TRAF3 mutation is a major contributor in MALT1 rearrangement-negative gastric marginal zone lymphoma.	2019	07	17	Mod Pathol	Hyeon	Jiyeon
29881386	10.3389/fimmu.2018.01136	Ancient Origin of the CARD-Coiled Coil/Bcl10/MALT1-Like Paracaspase Signaling Complex Indicates Unknown Critical Functions.	The CARD-coiled coil (CC)/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) signaling complexes composed of a CARD-CC family member (CARD-9, -10, -11, or -14), Bcl10, and the type 1 paracaspase MALT1 (PCASP1) play a pivotal role in immunity, inflammation, and cancer. Targeting MALT1 proteolytic activity is of potential therapeutic interest. However, little is known about the evolutionary origin and the original functions of the CBM complex. Type 1 paracaspases originated before the last common ancestor of planulozoa (bilaterians and cnidarians). Notably in bilaterians, Ecdysozoa (e.g., nematodes and insects) lacks Bcl10, whereas other lineages have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-CC homologs revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient common origin of the entire CBM complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were only found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be related to the original function of the CBM complex. Moreover, the type 1 paracaspase sequences from invertebrate organisms that have CARD-CC/Bcl10 are more similar to vertebrate paracaspases. Functional analysis of protein-protein interactions, NF-κB signaling, and CYLD cleavage for selected invertebrate type 1 paracaspase and Bcl10 homologs supports this scenario and indicates an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. By contrast, many of the known MALT1-associated activities evolved fairly recently, indicating that unknown functions are at the basis of the protein conservation. As a proof-of-concept, we provide initial evidence for a CBM- and NF-κB-independent neuronal function of the Caenorhabditis elegans type 1 paracaspase malt-1. In conclusion, this study shows how evolutionary insights may point at alternative functions of MALT1.	2019	07	29	Front Immunol	Staal	Jens

Autoantigens drive BCR-dependent activation of NF-κB in ABC DLBCL through a kinase signalling cascade of SYK, BTK and PKCβ to promote the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 adaptor complex, which recruits and activates IκB kinase<sup>4-6</sup>. Genome sequencing revealed gain-of-function mutations that target the CD79A and CD79B BCR subunits and the Toll-like receptor signalling adaptor MYD88<sup>5,7</sup>, with MYD88(L265P) being the most prevalent isoform. In a clinical trial, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib produced responses in 37% of cases of ABC<sup>1</sup>. The most striking response rate (80%) was observed in tumours with both CD79B and MYD88(L265P) mutations, but how these mutations cooperate to promote dependence on BCR signalling remains unclear. Here we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and functional proteomics to determine the molecular basis of exceptional clinical responses to ibrutinib. We discovered a new mode of oncogenic BCR signalling in ibrutinib-responsive cell lines and biopsies, coordinated by a multiprotein supercomplex formed by MYD88, TLR9 and the BCR (hereafter termed the My-T-BCR supercomplex). The My-T-BCR supercomplex co-localizes with mTOR on endolysosomes, where it drives pro-survival NF-κB and mTOR signalling. Inhibitors of BCR and mTOR signalling cooperatively decreased the formation and function of the My-T-BCR supercomplex, providing mechanistic insight into their synergistic toxicity for My-T-BCR<sup>+</sup> DLBCL cells. My-T-BCR supercomplexes characterized ibrutinib-responsive malignancies and distinguished ibrutinib responders from non-responders. Our data provide a framework for the rational design of oncogenic signalling inhibitors in molecularly defined subsets of DLBCL.	2019	03	04	Nature	Phelan	James D
29953499	10.1371/journal.pone.0199779	Autocleavage of the paracaspase MALT1 at Arg-781 attenuates NF-κB signaling and regulates the growth of activated B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells.	MALT1 controls several receptors-mediated signaling to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through both its scaffold and protease function. MALT1 protease activity is shown to inactivate several negative regulators of NF-κB signaling and augment NF-κB activation ability. In this study, MALT1 was demonstrated to autoprocess itself in the presence of oligomerization-competent BCL10. Cleavage occurred after Arginine 781 located in the C-terminus of MALT1. Shortened MALT1 cleavage products showed attenuated binding ability with TRAF6. Its NF-κB activation ability was also weakened. Various MALT1 constructs including wild type, catalytically-inactive (MALT1_C464A), cleavage-defective (MALT1_R781L), or truncated (MALT1_1-781) form of MALT1 was introduced into MALT1-knocked-down-Jurkat T cells. Cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L retained its proteolytic and initial IκBα phosphorylation activity as MALT1. Truncated MALT1_1-781 mutant showed weakness in IκBα phosphorylation and the expression of NF-κB targets IL-2 and IFN-γ. Cleavage at R781 was detectable but marginal after activation with TPA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in lymphocytes. However, cleavage at R781 was evident in ABC-DLBCL cells such as OCI-Ly3, HBL-1. HBL-1 cells with induced expression of catalytically-inactive MALT1_C464A or cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L exhibited characteristic of retarded-growth. These findings suggested that cleavage at R781 of MALT1 played a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells.	2018	12	19	PLoS One	Wu	Chun-Hsien
30022982	10.3389/fimmu.2018.01539	BCL10 - Bridging CARDs to Immune Activation.	Since the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) protein was first described in 1999, numerous studies have elucidated its key functions in channeling adaptive and innate immune signaling downstream of CARMA/caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) scaffold proteins. While T and B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) signaling induces the recruitment of BCL10 bound to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)1 to the lymphocyte-specific CARMA1/CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM-1) signalosome, alternative CBM complexes utilize different CARMA/CARD scaffolds in distinct innate or inflammatory pathways. BCL10 constitutes the smallest subunit in all CBM signalosomes, containing a 233 amino acid coding for N-terminal CARD as well as a C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich region. BCL10 forms filaments, thereby aggregating into higher-order clusters that mediate and amplify stimulation-induced signals, ultimately leading to MALT1 protease activation and canonical NF-κB and JNK signaling. BCL10 additionally undergoes extensive post-translational regulation involving phosphorylation, ubiquitination, MALT1-catalyzed cleavage, and degradation. Through these feedback and feed-forward events, BCL10 integrates positive and negative regulatory processes that govern the function as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and destruction of CBM complexes. Thus, BCL10 is a critical regulator for activation as well as termination of immune cell signaling, revealing that its role extends far beyond that of a mere linking factor in CBM complexes.	2019	11	20	Front Immunol	Gehring	Torben
30206119	10.1074/jbc.RA118.004821	Picomolar zinc binding modulates formation of Bcl10-nucleating assemblies of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of CARD9.	The caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) signaling axis is activated in myeloid cells during the innate immune response to a variety of diverse pathogens. This signaling pathway requires a critical caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-CARD interaction between CARD9 and Bcl10 that promotes downstream activation of factors, including NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Despite these insights, CARD9 remains structurally uncharacterized, and little mechanistic understanding of its regulation exists. We unexpectedly found here that the CARD in CARD9 binds to Zn<sup>2+</sup> with picomolar affinity-a concentration comparable with the levels of readily accessible Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol. NMR solution structures of the CARD9-CARD in the apo and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-bound states revealed that Zn<sup>2+</sup> has little effect on the ground-state structure of the CARD; yet the stability of the domain increased considerably upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding, with a concomitant reduction in conformational flexibility. Moreover, Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding inhibited polymerization of the CARD9-CARD into helical assemblies. Here, we also present a 20-Å resolution negative-stain EM (NS-EM) structure of these filamentous assemblies and show that they adopt a similar helical symmetry as reported previously for filaments of the Bcl10 CARD. Using both bulk assays and direct NS-EM visualization, we further show that the CARD9-CARD assemblies can directly template and thereby nucleate Bcl10 polymerization, a capacity considered critical to propagation of the CARD9-Bcl10 signaling cascade. Our findings indicate that CARD9 is a potential target of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling that affects Bcl10 polymerization in innate immune responses.	2019	04	16	J Biol Chem	Holliday	Michael J
30214442	10.3389/fimmu.2018.01927	Holding All the CARDs: How MALT1 Controls CARMA/CARD-Dependent Signaling.	The scaffold proteins CARMA1-3 (encoded by the genes <i>CARD11, -14</i> and -<i>10</i>) and CARD9 play major roles in signaling downstream of receptors with immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). These receptors trigger the formation of oligomeric CARMA/CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complexes via kinases of the PKC family. The CBM in turn regulates gene expression by the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors and controls transcript stability. The paracaspase MALT1 is the only CBM component having an enzymatic (proteolytic) activity and has therefore recently gained attention as a potential drug target. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of the molecular function of the protease MALT1 and summarize how MALT1 scaffold and protease function contribute to the transmission of CBM signals. Finally, we will highlight how dysregulation of MALT1 function can cause pathologies such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, psoriasis, and cancer.	2019	09	19	Front Immunol	Juilland	Mélanie
30279415	10.1038/s41467-018-06573-8	Molecular architecture and regulation of BCL10-MALT1 filaments.	The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex triggers the adaptive immune response in lymphocytes and lymphoma cells. CARD11/CARMA1 acts as a molecular seed inducing BCL10 filaments, but the integration of MALT1 and the assembly of a functional CBM complex has remained elusive. Using cryo-EM we solved the helical structure of the BCL10-MALT1 filament. The structural model of the filament core solved at 4.9 Å resolution identified the interface between the N-terminal MALT1 DD and the BCL10 caspase recruitment domain. The C-terminal MALT1 Ig and paracaspase domains protrude from this core to orchestrate binding of mediators and substrates at the filament periphery. Mutagenesis studies support the importance of the identified BCL10-MALT1 interface for CBM complex assembly, MALT1 protease activation and NF-κB signaling in Jurkat and primary CD4 T-cells. Collectively, we present a model for the assembly and architecture of the CBM signaling complex and how it functions as a signaling hub in T-lymphocytes.	2019	01	22	Nat Commun	Schlauderer	Florian
30283440	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02078	The CBM-opathies-A Rapidly Expanding Spectrum of Human Inborn Errors of Immunity Caused by Mutations in the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 Complex.	The caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11 or CARMA1)-B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-MALT1 paracaspase (MALT1) [CBM] signalosome complex serves as a molecular bridge between cell surface antigen receptor signaling and the activation of the NF-κB, JNK, and mTORC1 signaling axes. This positions the CBM complex as a critical regulator of lymphocyte activation, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Inborn errors in each of the CBM components have now been linked to a diverse group of human primary immunodeficiency diseases termed ""CBM-opathies."" Clinical manifestations range from severe combined immunodeficiency to selective B cell lymphocytosis, atopic disease, and specific humoral defects. This surprisingly broad spectrum of phenotypes underscores the importance of ""tuning"" CBM signaling to preserve immune homeostasis. Here, we review the distinct clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with human CBM complex mutations and introduce new avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention.	2019	09	30	Front Immunol	Lu	Henry Y

30336982	10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.029	MALT1 activation by TRAF6 needs neither BCL10 nor CARD11.	The MALT1 (Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) paracaspase couples antigen receptors on lymphocytes to downstream signaling events. Activation of MALT1 is known to involve stimulus-dependent CBM complex formation, that is, the recruitment of BCL10-bound MALT1 to a CARD-Coiled Coil protein. Beyond this canonical, CBM-dependent mechanism of MALT1 activation, recent studies suggest that MALT1 protease activity may be triggered by alternative mechanisms. For instance, the E3-ligase TRAF6 can activate MALT1 proteolytic function and induce MALT1 auto-cleavage. However, the interplay between CBM and TRAF6 with regard to MALT1 activation has remained incompletely elucidated. Here, by generating CRISPR/Cas9-derived knock-out Jurkat T-cells, we show that TRAF6 was dispensable for CARD11/BCL10-dependent MALT1 activation upon T-cell stimulation. However, ectopically-expressed TRAF6 could induce MALT1 activity in Jurkat T-cells devoid of either CARD11 or BCL10. These data provide unequivocal evidence that TRAF6-mediated MALT1 activation does not require the upstream scaffold CARD11 or the interaction between MALT1 and BCL10. Thus, TRAF6 may be part of a previously unidentified non-canonical pathway that triggers MALT1 protease activity independently of canonical CBM signalosomes.	2019	05	14	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Bardet	Maureen
30386326	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02239	Clinical and Genetic Heterogeneity of <i>CARD14</i> Mutations in Psoriatic Skin Disease.	The CARD: BCL10: MALT1 (CBM) complex is an essential signaling node for maintaining both innate and adaptive immune responses. CBM complex components have gained considerable interest due to the dramatic effects of associated mutations in causing severe lymphomas, immunodeficiencies, carcinomas and inflammatory disease. While MALT1 and BCL10 are ubiquitous proteins, the CARD-containing proteins differ in their tissue expression. CARD14 is primarily expressed in keratinocytes. The CARD14-BCL10-MALT1 complex is activated by upstream pathogen-associated molecular pattern-recognition <i>in vitro</i>, highlighting a potentially crucial role in innate immune defense at the epidermal barrier. Recent findings have demonstrated how CARD14 orchestrates activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways <i>via</i> recruitment of BCL10 and MALT1, leading to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding IL-36γ, IL-8, Ccl20 and anti-microbial peptides. Following the identification of CARD14 gain-of function mutations as responsible for the psoriasis susceptibility locus <i>PSORS2</i>, the past years have witnessed a large volume of case reports and association studies describing CARD14 variants as causal or predisposing to a wide range of inflammatory skin disorders. Recent publications of mouse models also helped to better understand the physiological contribution of CARD14 to psoriasis pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the clinical, genetic and functional aspects of human and murine CARD14 mutations and their contribution to psoriatic disease pathogenesis.	2019	09	30	Front Immunol	Israel	Laura

Activating <i>MYD88</i> mutations are present in 95% of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) patients, and trigger NF-κB through BTK and IRAK. The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is active in <i>MYD88-</i>mutated <i>(MYD88</i> <sup><i>MUT</i></sup> ) WM patients, but shows lower activity in <i>MYD88</i> wild-type (<i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> ) disease. <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> patients also show shorter overall survival, and increased risk of disease transformation in some series. The genomic basis for these findings remains to be clarified. We performed whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of sorted tumor samples from 18 <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> patients and compared findings with WM patients with <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>MUT</i></sup> disease. We identified somatic mutations predicted to activate NF-κB (<i>TBL1XR1</i>, <i>PTPN13, MALT1</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, <i>NFKB2</i>, <i>NFKBIB</i>, <i>NFKBIZ,</i> and <i>UDRL1F</i>), impart epigenomic dysregulation (<i>KMT2D</i>, <i>KMT2C,</i> and <i>KDM6A)</i>, or impair DNA damage repair (<i>TP53</i>, <i>ATM</i>, and <i>TRRAP</i>). Predicted NF-κB activating mutations were downstream of BTK and IRAK, and many overlapped with somatic mutations found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A distinctive transcriptional profile in <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> WM was identified, although most differentially expressed genes overlapped with <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>MUT</i></sup> WM consistent with the many clinical and morphological characteristics that are shared by these WM subgroups. Overall survival was adversely affected by mutations in DNA damage response in <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> WM patients.

30429846	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02366	A <i>CARD9</i> Founder Mutation Disrupts NF-κB Signaling by Inhibiting BCL10 and MALT1 Recruitment and Signalosome Formation.	<b>Background:</b> Inherited CARD9 deficiency constitutes a primary immunodeficiency predisposing uniquely to chronic and invasive fungal infections. Certain mutations are shown to negatively impact CARD9 protein expression and/or NF-κB activation, but the underlying biochemical mechanism remains to be fully understood. <b>Objectives:</b> To investigate a possible founder origin of a known CARD9 R70W mutation in five families of Turkish origin. To explore the biochemical mechanism of immunodeficiency by R70W CARD9. <b>Methods:</b> We performed haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers and SNPs. We designed a model system exploiting a gain-of-function (GOF) CARD9 L213LI mutant that triggers constitutive NF-κB activation, analogous to an oncogenic CARD11 mutant, to study NF-κB signaling and signalosome formation. We performed reporter assays, immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging on HEK cells overexpressing different CARD9 variants. <b>Results:</b> We identified a common haplotype, thus providing evidence for a common Turkish founder. CARD9 R70W failed to activate NF-κB and abrogated NF-κB activation by WT CARD9 and by GOF CARD9. Notably, R70W CARD9 also exerted negative effects on NF-κB activation by CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14. Consistent with the NF-κB results, the R70W mutation prevented GOF CARD9 to pull down the signalosome partner proteins BCL10 and MALT1. This reflected into drastic reduction of BCL10 filamentous assemblies in a cellular context. Indeed, structural analysis revealed that position R70 in CARD9 maps at the putative interface between successive CARD domains in CARD9 filaments. <b>Conclusions:</b> The R70W mutation in CARD9 prevents NF-κB activation by inhibiting productive interactions with downstream BCL10 and MALT1, necessary for assembly of the filamentous CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome.	2019	10	03	Front Immunol	De Bruyne	Marieke
30446641	10.1038/s41467-018-07215-9	Cellular metabolism constrains innate immune responses in early human ontogeny.	Pathogen immune responses are profoundly attenuated in fetuses and premature infants, yet the mechanisms underlying this developmental immaturity remain unclear. Here we show transcriptomic, metabolic and polysome profiling and find that monocytes isolated from infants born early in gestation display perturbations in PPAR-γ-regulated metabolic pathways, limited glycolytic capacity and reduced ribosomal activity. These metabolic changes are linked to a lack of translation of most cytokines and of MALT1 signalosome genes essential to respond to the neonatal pathogen Candida. In contrast, they have little impact on house-keeping phagocytosis functions. Transcriptome analyses further indicate a role for mTOR and its putative negative regulator DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4-Like in regulating these metabolic constraints. Our results provide a molecular basis for the broad susceptibility to multiple pathogens in these infants, and suggest that the fetal immune system is metabolically programmed to avoid energetically costly, dispensable and potentially harmful immune responses during ontogeny.	2018	12	19	Nat Commun	Kan	Bernard
30474008	10.3389/fonc.2018.00498	Post-translational Modifications of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 Complex in Lymphocytes and Activated B-Cell Like Subtype of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Piracy of the NF-κB transcription factors signaling pathway, to sustain its activity, is a mechanism often deployed in B-cell lymphoma to promote unlimited growth and survival. The aggressive activated B-cell like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exploits a multi-protein complex of CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex), which normally conveys NF-κB signaling upon antigen receptors engagement. Once assembled, the CBM also unleashes MALT1 protease activity to finely tune the immune response. As a result, ABC DLBCL tumors develop a profound addiction to NF-κB and to MALT1 enzyme, leaving open a breach for therapeutics. However, the pleiotropic nature of NF-κB jeopardizes the success of its targeting and urges us to develop new strategies. In this review, we discuss how post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the CBM components, as well as, MALT1 proteolytic activity, shape the CBM activity in lymphocytes and ABC DLBCL, and may provide new avenues to restore vulnerability in lymphoma.	2020	10	01	Front Oncol	Thys	An
30515170	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02695	BCL10-CARD11 Fusion Mimics an Active CARD11 Seed That Triggers Constitutive BCL10 Oligomerization and Lymphocyte Activation.	Assembly of the CARD11/CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex upon T or B cell antigen receptor (TCR or BCR) engagement drives lymphocyte activation. Recruitment of pre-assembled BCL10-MALT1 complexes to CARD11 fosters activation of the MALT1 protease and canonical NF-<b>κ</b>B signaling. Structural data and <i>in vitro</i> assays have suggested that CARD11 acts as a seed that nucleates the assembly of BCL10 filaments, but the relevance of these findings for CBM complex assembly in cells remains unresolved. To uncouple cellular CARD11 recruitment of BCL10 and BCL10 filament assembly, we generated a BCL10-CARD11 fusion protein that links the C-terminus of BCL10 to the N-terminus of CARD11. When stably expressed in CARD11 KO Jurkat T cells, the BCL10-CARD11 fusion induced constitutive MALT1 activation. Furthermore, in CARD11 KO BJAB B cells, BCL10-CARD11 promoted constitutive NF-<b>κ</b>B activation to a similar extent as CARD11 containing oncogenic driver mutations. Using structure-guided destructive mutations in the CARD11-BCL10 (CARD11 R35A) or BCL10-BCL10 (BCL10 R42E) interfaces, we demonstrate that chronic activation by the BCL10-CARD11 fusion protein was independent of the CARD11 CARD. However, activation strictly relied upon the ability of the BCL10 CARD to form oligomers. Thus, by combining distinct CARD mutations in the context of constitutively active BCL10-CARD11 fusion proteins, we provide evidence that BCL10-MALT1 recruitment to CARD11 and BCL10 oligomerization are interconnected processes, which bridge the CARD11 seed to downstream pathways in lymphocytes.	2019	10	02	Front Immunol	Seeholzer	Thomas
30553470	10.1016/j.cancergen.2018.08.001	Primary extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas: Many sites, many entities? Clinico-pathological, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic study of 106 cases.	We analyzed the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic features of 106 extranodal (EN) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) from stomach (34 cases), intestine (10), cervico-cephalic region (11), central nervous system (13), testes (21), skin (8), and miscellaneous sites (9). Hans' algorithm and the immunohistochemical double expressor score (DES) for MYC and BCL2 were applied to all cases. A subset of fifty-eight cases were analyzed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific break apart probes for BCL6, MYC, BCL2, CCND1, BCL10 and MALT1 genes. Clinical records were available for all patients. The immunohistochemical study showed that, in our series of EN-DLBCLs, the Hans' subgroup and the DES differed significantly according to the site of origin. At FISH analysis, BCL6 and BCL2 were the most commonly rearranged genes in non-GC and in GC cases, respectively. Gastrointestinal lymphomas displayed the highest rate of gene rearrangements, often with MYC involvement. One testicular DLBCL showed BCL2/MYC double hit. At survival analysis, cerebral and testicular origin was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, Hans' subgroup and other immunohistochemical markers influenced patients' outcome. In conclusion, our data suggest that immunophenotypic, genetic and survival characteristics of EN-DLBCL are related to the specific primary site of the disease.	2019	04	29	Cancer Genet	Magnoli	Francesca
26354285	10.1002/hon.2251	Concomitant high expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling molecules has clinical implications in mantle cell lymphoma.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive disease with frequent relapse. Targeted therapies against B-cell receptor (BCR) molecules have demonstrated improved outcomes in relapsed cases. However, clinical responses are slow and selective, with failure to attain complete remission in a significant subset of patients. Complex interaction of BCR signal transduction with toll-like receptor (TLR) and other pathways in MCL remains unknown, thus averting progress in development of targeted therapies. We have performed detailed digital quantification of BCR/TLR signalling molecules and their effector pathways in a cohort (n = 81) of MCL patients and correlated these data with overall survival. Hierarchical clustering model based on BCR/TLR genes revealed two distinct (BCR<sup>high</sup> and BCR<sup>low</sup> ) subsets of patients (n = 32; 40%) with significant differences in expression (&gt;1.5-fold change; p &lt; 0.05). Higher levels of BTK/SYK/BLNK/CARD11/PLCG signalosome and lower expression of MALT1/BCL10 genes suggested tonic pattern of BCR activation. Amplified expression of TLR6/TLR7/TLR9 was noted in concert with hyper-responsiveness of BCR machinery. MYD88, a key TLR adaptor molecule, was not upregulated in any of these clusters, which may suggest a 'cross-talk' between BCR and TLR pathways. In sync with BCR/TLR signalling, we recorded significantly enhanced expression of genes associated with NF-kB pathway in BCR<sup>high</sup> subset of MCL patients. On univariate analysis, the BCR<sup>high</sup> patients showed a trend towards inferior clinical response to a standardized treatment protocol, compared with the BCR<sup>low</sup> group (log rank, p = 0.043). In conclusion, we have identified hyperactive BCR/TLR signalling pathways and their effector downstream targets in a subset of MCL patients and associated it with poor clinical outcomes. Our study provides quantitative evidence at RNA expression level of possible concomitant collaboration between TLR and BCR signalling molecules in MCL. These data will provide further insights for future functional studies and, hence, development of targeted therapies for MCL patients.

BCL10 was recently demonstrated to be a biomarker for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but whether altered BCL10 expression can be detected in cell block specimens is unclear. Here, we report a pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma with cytological findings that showed BCL10 expression in a cell block. A 72-year-old man presented with a pancreatic tumor and underwent endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with additional passes performed for cell block preparation. The EUS-FNA cytology showed loose cohesive clusters with focal acinar- or gland-like-structures and prominent nucleoli. The preoperative diagnosis was well differentiated adenocarcinoma, and he underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histological examination revealed an acinar tumor structure with tumor cells staining positive for BCL10 and trypsin. The cell block specimen also demonstrated strong and diffuse BCL10-positive staining. Based on these findings, this tumor was diagnosed as acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. This case demonstrates that BCL10 expression within cell blocks facilitates a differential diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma. Diagn.

27864294	10.1182/blood-2016-05-718775	B-cell receptor-driven MALT1 activity regulates MYC signaling in mantle cell lymphoma.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a mature B-cell lymphoma characterized by poor clinical outcome. Recent studies revealed the importance of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in maintaining MCL survival. However, it remains unclear which role MALT1, an essential component of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex that links BCR signaling to the NF-κB pathway, plays in the biology of MCL. Here we show that a subset of MCLs is addicted to MALT1, as its inhibition by either RNA or pharmacologic interference induced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression profiling following MALT1 inhibition demonstrated that MALT1 controls an MYC-driven gene expression network predominantly through increasing MYC protein stability. Thus, our analyses identify a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism of MYC expression. Investigating primary mouse splenocytes, we could demonstrate that MALT1-induced MYC regulation is not restricted to MCL, but represents a common mechanism. MYC itself is pivotal for MCL survival because its downregulation and pharmacologic inhibition induced cytotoxicity in all MCL models. Collectively, these results provide a strong mechanistic rationale to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the MALT1-MYC axis in MCL patients.	2017	08	23	Blood	Dai	Beiying
27873317	10.1002/path.4852	The B-cell-activating factor signalling pathway is associated with Helicobacter pylori independence in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma without t(11;18)(q21;q21).	We previously reported that activation of the B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) pathway upregulates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and induces BCL3 and BCL10 nuclear translocation in Helicobacter pylori (HP)-independent gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumours with evidence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). However, the significance of BAFF expression in HP independence of gastric low-grade MALT lymphomas without t(11;18)(q21;q21) remains unexplored. Sixty-four patients who underwent successful HP eradication for localized HP-positive gastric MALT lymphomas without t(11;18)(q21;q21) were studied. BAFF expression was significantly higher in the HP-independent group than in the HP-dependent group [22/26 (84.6%) versus 8/38 (21.1%); p &lt; 0.001]. Similarly, BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) expression (p = 0.004) and nuclear BCL3 (p = 0.004), BCL10 (p &lt; 0.001), NF-κB (p65) (p = 0.001) and NF-κB (p52) (p = 0.005) expression were closely correlated with the HP independence of these tumours. Moreover, BAFF overexpression was significantly associated with BAFF-R expression and nuclear BCL3, BCL10, NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB (p52) expression. These findings were further validated in an independent cohort, including 40 HP-dependent cases and 18 HP-independent cases of gastric MALT lymphoma without t(11;18)(q21;q21). The biological significance of BAFF signalling in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-negative lymphoma cells was further studied in two types of lymphoma B cell: OCI-Ly3 [non-germinal centre B-cell origin DLBCL without t(11;18)(q21;q21) cell line] and MA-1 [t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1-positive DLBCL cell line]. In both cell lines, we found that BAFF activated the canonical NF-κB and AKT pathways, and induced the formation of BCL10-BCL3 complexes, which translocated to the nucleus. BCL10 and BCL3 nuclear translocation and NF-κB (p65) transactivation were inhibited by either LY294002 or by silencing BCL3 or BCL10 with small interfering RNA. BAFF also activated non-canonical NF-κB pathways (p52) through tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 degradation, NF-κB-inducing kinase accumulation, inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) α/β phosphorylation and NF-κB p100 processing in both cell lines. Our data indicate that the autocrine BAFF signal transduction pathway contributes to HP independence in gastric MALT lymphomas without the t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation.

27939769	10.1016/j.jid.2016.09.031	CARD14-Mediated Activation of Paracaspase MALT1 in Keratinocytes: Implications for Psoriasis.	Mutations in caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 14(CARD14) have been linked to susceptibility to psoriasis. CARD14 is an intracellular scaffold protein that regulates proinflammatory gene expression. Recent studies have offered novel insights into the mechanisms of CARD14-mediated signaling in keratinocytes and the molecular impact of psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations. CARD14 forms a signaling complex with BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1, and this process is enhanced upon pathogenic CARD14 mutation, culminating in the activation of MALT1 protease activity and psoriasis-associated gene expression. This review summarizes the current knowledge of CARD14/MALT1-mediated signaling in keratinocytes and its therapeutic implications in psoriasis.	2017	07	26	J Invest Dermatol	Van Nuffel	Elien
28052131	10.1371/journal.pone.0169026	Two Antagonistic MALT1 Auto-Cleavage Mechanisms Reveal a Role for TRAF6 to Unleash MALT1 Activation.	The paracaspase MALT1 has arginine-directed proteolytic activity triggered by engagement of immune receptors. Recruitment of MALT1 into activation complexes is required for MALT1 proteolytic function. Here, co-expression of MALT1 in HEK293 cells, either with activated CARD11 and BCL10 or with TRAF6, was used to explore the mechanism of MALT1 activation at the molecular level. This work identified a prominent self-cleavage site of MALT1 isoform A (MALT1A) at R781 (R770 in MALT1B) and revealed that TRAF6 can activate MALT1 independently of the CBM. Intramolecular cleavage at R781/R770 removes a C-terminal TRAF6-binding site in both MALT1 isoforms, leaving MALT1B devoid of the two key interaction sites with TRAF6. A previously identified auto-proteolysis site of MALT1 at R149 leads to deletion of the death-domain, thereby abolishing interaction with BCL10. By using MALT1 isoforms and cleaved fragments thereof, as well as TRAF6 WT and mutant forms, this work shows that TRAF6 induces N-terminal auto-proteolytic cleavage of MALT1 at R149 and accelerates MALT1 protein turnover. The MALT1 fragment generated by N-terminal self-cleavage at R149 was labile and displayed enhanced signaling properties that required an intact K644 residue, previously shown to be a site for mono-ubiquitination of MALT1. Conversely, C-terminal self-cleavage at R781/R770 hampered the ability for self-cleavage at R149 and stabilized MALT1 by hindering interaction with TRAF6. C-terminal self-cleavage had limited impact on MALT1A but severely reduced MALT1B proteolytic and signaling functions. It also abrogated NF-κB activation by N-terminally cleaved MALT1A. Altogether, this study provides further insights into mechanisms that regulate the scaffolding and activation cycle of MALT1. It also emphasizes the reduced functional capacity of MALT1B as compared to MALT1A.	2017	08	28	PLoS One	Ginster	Stefanie
28158919	10.1111/jcmm.13050	Zinc rescues obesity-induced cardiac hypertrophy via stimulating metallothionein to suppress oxidative stress-activated BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK pathway.	Obesity often leads to obesity-related cardiac hypertrophy (ORCH), which is suppressed by zinc-induced inactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which zinc inactivates p38 MAPK to prevent ORCH. Mice (4-week old) were fed either high fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal fat) or normal diet (ND, 10% kcal fat) containing variable amounts of zinc (deficiency, normal and supplement) for 3 and 6 months. P38 MAPK siRNA and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were used to suppress p38 MAPK activity in vitro and in vivo, respectively. HFD activated p38 MAPK and increased expression of B-cell lymphoma/CLL 10 (BCL10) and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9). These responses were enhanced by zinc deficiency and attenuated by zinc supplement. Administration of SB203580 to HFD mice or specific siRNA in palmitate-treated cardiomyocytes eliminated the HFD and zinc deficiency activation of p38 MAPK, but did not significantly impact the expression of BCL10 and CARD9. In cultured cardiomyocytes, inhibition of BCL10 expression by siRNA prevented palmitate-induced increased p38 MAPK activation and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression. In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAPK prevented ANP expression, but did not affect BCL10 expression. Deletion of metallothionein abolished the protective effect of zinc on palmitate-induced up-regulation of BCL10 and phospho-p38 MAPK. HFD and zinc deficiency synergistically induce ORCH by increasing oxidative stress-mediated activation of BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK signalling. Zinc supplement ameliorates ORCH through activation of metallothionein to repress oxidative stress-activated BCL10 expression and p38 MAPK activation.	2018	02	21	J Cell Mol Med	Wang	Shudong

But there is substantial controversy about its safety. <i>Methods.</i> We investigated whether the <i>κ</i>-carrageenan could enhance lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-8 expression by studying its actions on the TLR4-NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway. The aggravating effect of <i>κ</i>-carrageenan on <i>Citrobacter freundii</i> DBS100-induced intestinal inflammation was also investigated in a mouse model. <i>Results.</i> Our data show that <i>κ</i>-carrageenan pretreatment promoted LPS-induced IL-8 expression in HT-29 cells. Although CD14, MD-2, and TLR4 were upregulated, the binding of LPS was not enhanced. However, the pathway of Bcl10-NF-<i>κ</i>B was triggered. Interestingly, <i>κ</i>-carrageenan competitively blocked the binding of FITC-LPS. Furthermore, pretreatment with <i>κ</i>-carrageenan for one week previous to gavage with <i>C. freundii</i> DBS100 markedly aggravated weight loss, mortality, and colonic damage. The secretion of cytokines was unbalanced and the ratio of Tregs was decreased significantly. In addition, <i>κ</i>-carrageenan, together with <i>C. freundii</i> DBS100, enhanced the transcription and secretion of TLR4 and NF-<i>κ</i>B. <i>Conclusions</i>. <i>κ</i>-Carrageenan can synergistically activate LPS-induced inflammatory through the Bcl10-NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway, as indicated by its aggravation of <i>C. freundii</i> DBS100-induced colitis in mice. <i>General Significance.</i> Our results suggest that <i>κ</i>-carrageenan serves as a potential inflammatory agent that magnifies existing intestinal inflammation.	2017	07	10	Mediators Inflamm	Wu	Wei
28230860	10.1038/cddis.2017.51	CARMA2sh and ULK2 control pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognition in human keratinocytes: psoriasis-linked CARMA2sh mutants escape ULK2 censorship.	The molecular complexes formed by specific members of the family of CARMA proteins, the CARD domain-containing adapter molecule BCL10 and MALT1 (CBM complex) represent a central hub in regulating activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-κB. Recently, missense mutations in CARMA2sh have been shown to cause psoriasis in a dominant manner and with high penetrancy. Here, we demonstrate that in human keratinocytes CARMA2sh plays an essential role in the signal transduction pathway that connects pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognition to NF-κB activation. We also find that the serine/threonine kinase ULK2 binds to and phosphorylates CARMA2sh, thereby inhibiting its capacity to activate NF-κB by promoting lysosomal degradation of BCL10, which is essential for CARMA2sh-mediated NF-κB signaling. Remarkably, CARMA2sh mutants associated with psoriasis escape ULK2 inhibition. Finally, we show that a peptide blocking CARD-mediated BCL10 interactions reduces the capacity of psoriasis-linked CARMA2sh mutants to activate NF-κB. Our work elucidates a fundamental signaling mechanism operating in human keratinocytes and opens to novel potential tools for the therapeutical treatment of human skin disorders.	2017	10	30	Cell Death Dis	Scudiero	Ivan
28288707	10.1016/j.beha.2016.09.002	MALT lymphoma: Genetic abnormalities, immunological stimulation and molecular mechanism.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) occurs at diverse anatomic sites and is closely associated with several distinct chronic inflammatory disorders. Both the acquired genetic abnormalities and active chronic immunological responses play a critical role in the development of MALT lymphoma, interestingly by dysregulating similar molecular mechanisms. The three translocations seen in MALT lymphoma, namely t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/BIRC3 (API2)-MALT1 are capable of activating both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. TNFAIP3 (A20) inactivation by deletion and/or mutation abolishes its negative regulation to several signalling including BCR and TLR, which activate the canonical NF-κB pathway. Similarly, the immunological responses also activate the canonical NF-κB pathway via surface antigen receptor and TLR, and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by T-cell help and BAFFR. There is also emerging evidence indicating oncogenic cooperation between the above genetic changes and immunological stimulation in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma.	2017	10	09	Best Pract Res Clin Haematol	Du	Ming-Qing
28672935	10.3892/etm.2017.4464	Next-generation sequencing reveals lymph node metastasis associated genetic markers in colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent type of cancer in the United States. Early diagnosis of lymph node metastases is essential to improve the prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer. Therefore, the present study aimed to screen genetic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and mRNA expression, associated with lymph node metastases in patients with colorectal cancer to enable an early diagnosis. Targeted next-generation sequencing was applied to capture SNPs and CNVs in tumor-related candidate genes within tumor tissues from 39 colorectal cancer patients; reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the specific mRNA level of tumor-related candidate genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor C, cyclin-A2, Interleukin-2, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) on chromosome 4. The SNPs in solute carrier family 28 member 3 (SLC28A3), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), ribonucleotide reductase regulators subunit M2 (RRM2), PMS1 homolog 2 (PMS2), cytidine deaminase (CDA), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), heterogenous ribonucleoprotein particle-associated with lethal yellow (RALY), Siglec-3 (CD33), B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10), ETS variant 1 (ETV1), macrophage stimulating 1 receptor 1 (MST1R), lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), U6 small nuclear RNA-associated Sm-like protein 3 (LSM3), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 1 (MAP3K1) were significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis (P&lt;0.05). EGF and NFKB1 were both observed to be significantly downregulated in the lymph node metastases group (P&lt;0.05). Although no association between CNVs and lymph node metastases in patients with colorectal cancer was observed in the present study, SNPs in SLC28A3, BRCA1, RRM2, PMS2, CDA, EPHX1, RALY, CD33, BCL10, ETV1, MST1R, KMT2B, BCL2, LSM3, TTF1 and MAP3K1 were significantly associated with colorectal cancer. Downregulation of EGF and NFKB1 was also identified to be associated with lymph node metastases in colorectal cancer. The findings of the current study provide a scientific basis for the clinical inspection of lymphatic metastasis and prognosis prediction, intervention and guidance therapy for patients with colorectal cancer.	2020	09	30	Exp Ther Med	Xie	Ni

28765954	10.3892/mmr.2017.7116	In vitro reconstitution of interactions in the CARD9 signalosome.	The caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD)‑containing protein 9 (CARD9) signalosome is composed of CARD9, B‑cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa‑associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1). The CARD9 signalosome has been reported to exert critical functions in the immunoreceptor tyrosine‑based activation motif‑coupled receptor‑mediated activation of myeloid cells, through nuclear factor‑κB pathways during innate immunity processes. During CARD9 signalosome assembly, BCL10 has been revealed to function as an adaptor protein and to interact with CARD9 via CARD‑CARD interactions; BCL10 also interacts with MALT1 via its C‑terminal Ser/Thr‑rich region and the first immunoglobulin domain of MALT1. The CARD9 signalosome is implicated in critical biological processes; however, its structural and biochemical characteristics have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, CARD9 and BCL10 CARDs were successfully purified and characterized, and their biochemical properties were investigated. In addition, CARD9‑BCL10 complexes were reconstituted in vitro under low salt and pH conditions. Furthermore, based on structural modeling data, a scheme was proposed to describe the interactions between CARD9 and BCL10. This provides a further understanding of the mechanism of how the CARD9 signalosome may be assembled.	2018	05	21	Mol Med Rep	Park	Jin Hee
29084984	10.1038/s41598-017-14102-8	First-line antibiotic therapy in Helicobacter pylori-negative low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	First-line antibiotic treatment for eradicating Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is effective in HP-positive low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma), but its role in HP-negative cases is uncertain. In this exploratory retrospective study, we assessed the outcome and potential predictive biomarkers for 25 patients with HP-negative localized gastric MALToma who received first-line HP eradication (HPE) therapy. An HP-negative status was defined as negative results on histology, rapid urease test, <sup>13</sup>C urea breath test, and serology. We observed an antibiotic response (complete remission [CR], number = 8; partial remission, number = 1) in 9 (36.0%) out of 25 patients. A t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation was detected in 7 (43.8%) of 16 antibiotic-unresponsive cases, but in none of the 9 antibiotic-responsive cases (P = 0.027). Nuclear BCL10 expression was significantly higher in antibiotic-unresponsive tumors than in antibiotic-responsive tumors (14/16 [87.5%] vs. 1/9 [11.1%]; P = 0.001). Nuclear NF-κB expression was also significantly higher in antibiotic-unresponsive tumors than in antibiotic-responsive tumors (12/16 [75.0%] vs. 1/9 [11.1%]; P = 0.004). A substantial portion of patients with HP-negative gastric MALToma responded to first-line HPE. In addition to t(11;18)(q21;q21), BCL10 and NF-κB are useful immunohistochemical biomarkers to predict antibiotic-unresponsive status in this group of tumors.	2019	07	30	Sci Rep	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
29194363	10.3390/ijms18122581	The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF7 Negatively Regulates CARD14/CARMA2sh Signaling.	The three CARD-containing MAGUK (CARMA) proteins function as scaffolding molecules that regulate activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Recently, mutations in CARMA2 have been linked to psoriasis susceptibility due to their acquired altered capacity to activate NF-κB. By means of two-hybrid screening with yeast, we identified RING finger protein 7 (RNF7) as an interactor of CARMA2. We present evidence that RNF7 functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB-activating capacity of CARMA2. Mechanistically, RNF7 influences CARMA2 signaling by regulating the ubiquitination state of MALT1 and the NF-κB-regulatory molecule NEMO. Interestingly, CARMA2<i>short</i> (CARMA2<i>sh</i>) mutants associated with psoriasis susceptibility escape the negative control exerted by RNF7. In conclusion, our findings identify a new mechanism through which the ability of CARMA2 to activate NF-κB is regulated, which could have significant implications for our understanding of why mutations of this protein trigger human psoriasis.	2018	07	11	Int J Mol Sci	Telesio	Gianluca
29225710	10.1007/s12308-017-0302-2	Novel developments in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL), mostly represented by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, also referred to as MALT lymphoma, is a clinically heterogeneous entity within the group of low-grade B cell lymphomas that arises in a wide range of different extranodal sites, including the stomach, lung, ocular adnexa, and skin. It represents the third most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western world, and the median age of occurrence is around 60 years. One characteristic aspect in a subset of EMZL detectable in about 25% of the cases is the presence of specific chromosomal translocations involving the genes <i>MALT1</i> and <i>BCL10</i>, which lead to activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Another unique aspect is that several infectious agents, such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> in the case of gastric EMZL, and autoimmune disorders, like Sjögren syndrome, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this cancer. Recent findings as summarized in this review have further improved our understanding of the complex pathobiology of this disease and have been essential to better define novel treatment strategies. In addition, many of these specific features are currently being implemented for the diagnosis of EMZL.	2020	10	01	J Hematop	Schreuder	Max I
29340061	10.18632/oncotarget.22799	Analysis of the mutational landscape of classic Hodgkin lymphoma identifies disease heterogeneity and potential therapeutic targets.	Defining the mutational landscape of classic Hodgkin lymphoma is still a major research goal. New targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques may identify pathogenic mechanisms and new therapeutic opportunities related to this disease. We describe the mutational profile of a series of 57 cHL cases, enriched in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Overall, the results confirm the presence of strong genomic heterogeneity. However, several variants were consistently detected in genes related to relevant signaling pathways, such as GM-CSF/IL-3, CBP/EP300, JAK/STAT, NF-kappaB, and numerous variants of genes affecting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, such as <i>BTK</i>, <i>CARD11</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, among others. This unexpectedly high prevalence of mutations affecting the BCR pathway suggests some requirement for active BCR signaling for cHL cell viability. Additionally, incubation of a panel of cHL cellular models with selective BTK inhibitors <i>in vitro</i> constrains cell proliferation and causes cell death. Our results indicate new pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities in this disease.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Mata	Elena
26392569	10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-15-0229-T	The CBM Complex Underwrites NF-κB Activation to Promote HER2-Associated Tumor Malignancy.	The HER2/Neu protein is overexpressed in a large fraction of human breast cancers. NF-κB is one of several transcription factors that are aberrantly activated in HER2-positive breast cancers; however, the molecular mechanism by which HER2 activates NF-κB remains unclear. The CARMA3-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex is required for GPCR- and EGFR-induced NF-κB activation. In the current study, the role of the CBM complex in HER2-mediated NF-κB activation and HER2-positive breast cancer was investigated. Interestingly, HER2-mediated NF-κB activation requires protein kinase C (PKC) activity rather than AKT activity. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, it was shown that the CBM complex is required for HER2-induced NF-κB activation and functionally contributes to multiple properties of malignancy, such as proliferation, avoidance of apoptosis, migration, and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CARMA3-mediated NF-κB activity was required for the upregulation of two matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP1 and MMP13, both of which contribute to tumor metastasis. To further access the physiologic role of CBM complex-mediated NF-κB activation in HER2-positive breast cancer progression, Malt1 knockout mice (Malt1(-/-)) were crossed with MMTV-Neu mice, in which mammary tumors spontaneously developed with HER2 overexpression. We observed delayed onset and prolonged progression time in mammary tumors in Malt1 knockout mice compared with control mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that the CBM complex is a crucial component mediating HER2-induced NF-κB signaling and tumor malignancy in HER2-positive breast cancer. The CBM complex bridges key signaling pathways to confer malignant phenotypes and metastatic potential in HER2-associated breast cancer.	2016	10	18	Mol Cancer Res	Pan	Deng
26521038	10.1016/j.jaci.2015.09.016	Impaired RASGRF1/ERK-mediated GM-CSF response characterizes CARD9 deficiency in French-Canadians.	Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency conferring human susceptibility to invasive fungal disease, including spontaneous central nervous system candidiasis (sCNSc). However, clinical characterization of sCNSc is variable, hindering its recognition. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of the bases for this susceptibility has remained elusive. We sought to comprehensively characterize sCNSc and to dissect the mechanisms by which a hypomorphic CARD9 mutation causes susceptibility to Candida species. We describe the clinical and radiologic findings of sCNSc caused by CARD9 deficiency in a French-Canadian cohort. We performed genetic, cellular, and molecular analyses to further decipher its pathophysiology. In our French-Canadian series (n = 4) sCNSc had onset in adulthood (median, 38 years) and was often misinterpreted radiologically as brain malignancies; 1 patient had additional novel features (eg, endophthalmitis and osteomyelitis). CARD9 deficiency resulted from a hypomorphic p.Y91H mutation and allelic imbalance established in this population through founder effects. We demonstrate a consistent cellular phenotype of impaired GM-CSF responses. The ability of CARD9 to complex with B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is intact in our series, arguing against its involvement in susceptibility to fungi. Instead, we show that the p.Y91H mutation impairs the ability of CARD9 to complex with Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1), leading to impaired activation of nuclear factor κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in monocytes and subsequent GM-CSF responses. Successful treatment of a second patient with adjunctive GM-CSF bolsters the clinical relevance of these findings. Hypomorphic CARD9 deficiency caused by p.Y91H results in adult-onset disease with variable penetrance and expressivity. Our findings establish the CARD9/RASGRF1/ERK/GM-CSF axis as critical to the pathophysiology of sCNSc.	2016	08	29	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Gavino	Christina
26767426	10.1016/j.jid.2015.12.027	MALT1 Protease Activity Controls the Expression of Inflammatory Genes in Keratinocytes upon Zymosan Stimulation.	The protease activity of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) plays an important role in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation by controlling the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and is thus essential for the expression of inflammatory target genes. MALT1 is not only present in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, but is ubiquitously expressed. Here we report that stimulation with zymosan or Staphylococcus aureus induced MALT1 protease activity in human primary keratinocytes. Inhibition of the Src family of kinases or novel protein kinase C isoforms as well as silencing of CARMA2 or BCL10 interfered with activation of MALT1 protease. Silencing or inhibition of MALT1 protease strongly decreased the expression of important inflammatory genes such as TNFα, IL-17C, CXCL8 and HBD-2. MALT1-inhibited cells were unable to mount an antimicrobial response upon zymosan stimulation or phorbolester/ionomycin treatment, demonstrating a central role of MALT1 protease activity in keratinocyte immunity and suggesting MALT1 as a potential target in inflammatory skin diseases. 	2016	08	16	J Invest Dermatol	Schmitt	Anja
26771713	10.1080/15384101.2015.1121322	BCL10 is recruited to sites of DNA damage to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair.	Recent studies have found BCL10 can localize to the nucleus and that this is linked to tumor aggression and poorer prognosis. These studies suggest that BCL10 localization plays a novel role in the nucleus that may contribute to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that BCL10 functions as part of the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that BCL10 facilitates the rapid recruitment of RPA, BRCA1 and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage. Furthermore, we also found that ATM phosphorylates BCL10 in response to DNA damage. Functionally, BCL10 promoted DNA double-strand breaks repair, enhancing cell survival after DNA damage. Taken together our results suggest a novel role for BCL10 in the repair of DNA lesions. 	2016	10	13	Cell Cycle	Ismail	Ismail Hassan

26776161	10.1038/onc.2015.493	Oncogenic CARMA1 couples NF-κB and β-catenin signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	Constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a hallmark of the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recurrent oncogenic mutations are found in the scaffold protein CARMA1 (CARD11) that connects B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling to the canonical NF-κB pathway. We asked how far additional downstream processes are activated and contribute to the oncogenic potential of DLBCL-derived CARMA1 mutants. To this end, we expressed oncogenic CARMA1 in the NF-κB negative DLBCL lymphoma cell line BJAB. By a proteomic approach we identified recruitment of β-catenin and its destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN1, CK1α and GSK3β to oncogenic CARMA1. Recruitment of the β-catenin destruction complex was independent of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex formation or constitutive NF-κB activation and promoted the stabilization of β-catenin. The β-catenin destruction complex was also recruited to CARMA1 in ABC DLBCL cell lines, which coincided with elevated β-catenin expression. In line, β-catenin was frequently detected in non-GCB DLBCL biopsies that rely on chronic BCR signaling. Increased β-catenin amounts alone were not sufficient to induce classical WNT target gene signatures, but could augment TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activation in response to WNT signaling. In conjunction with NF-κB, β-catenin enhanced expression of immunosuppressive interleukin-10 and suppressed antitumoral CCL3, indicating that β-catenin can induce a favorable tumor microenvironment. Thus, parallel activation of NF-κB and β-catenin signaling by gain-of-function mutations in CARMA1 augments WNT stimulation and is required for regulating the expression of distinct NF-κB target genes to trigger cell-intrinsic and extrinsic processes that promote DLBCL lymphomagenesis.	2017	08	14	Oncogene	Bognar	M K
26884334	10.1074/jbc.M116.717322	Intramolecular Interactions and Regulation of Cofactor Binding by the Four Repressive Elements in the Caspase Recruitment Domain-containing Protein 11 (CARD11) Inhibitory Domain.	The CARD11 signaling scaffold transmits signaling between antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes and the transcription factor NF-κB during the adaptive immune response. CARD11 activity is controlled by an inhibitory domain (ID), which participates in intramolecular interactions and prevents cofactor binding prior to receptor triggering. Oncogenic CARD11 mutations associated with the activated B cell-like subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma somehow perturb ID-mediated autoinhibition to confer CARD11 with the dysregulated spontaneous signaling to NF-κB that is required for the proliferation and survival of the lymphoma. Here, we investigate how the four repressive elements (REs) we have discovered in the CARD11 ID function to inhibit CARD11 activity with cooperativity and redundancy. We find that each RE contributes to the maintenance of the closed inactive state of CARD11 that predominates in the absence of receptor engagement. Each RE also contributes to the prevention of Bcl10 binding in the basal unstimulated state. RE1, RE2, and RE3 participate in intramolecular interactions with other CARD11 domains and share domain targets for binding. Remarkably, diffuse large B cell lymphoma-associated gain-of-function mutations in the caspase recruitment domain, LATCH, or coiled coil can perturb intramolecular interactions mediated by multiple REs, suggesting how single amino acid oncogenic CARD11 mutations can perturb or bypass the action of redundant inhibitory REs to achieve the level of hyperactive CARD11 signaling required to support lymphoma growth. 	2016	10	07	J Biol Chem	Jattani	Rakhi P
26936881	10.4049/jimmunol.1403165	Usp9X Is Required for Lymphocyte Activation and Homeostasis through Its Control of ZAP70 Ubiquitination and PKCβ Kinase Activity.	To achieve a durable adaptive immune response, lymphocytes must undergo clonal expansion and induce a survival program that enables the persistence of Ag-experienced cells and the development of memory. During the priming phase of this response, CD4(+)T lymphocytes either remain tolerized or undergo clonal expansion. In this article, we show that Usp9X functions as a positive regulatory switch during T lymphocyte priming through removal of inhibitory monoubiquitination from ZAP70. In the absence of Usp9X, an increased amount of ZAP70 localized to early endosomes consistent with the role of monoubiquitin in endocytic sorting. Usp9X becomes competent to deubiquitinate ZAP70 through TCR-dependent phosphorylation and enhancement of its catalytic activity and association with the LAT signalosome. In B lymphocytes, Usp9X is required for the induction of PKCβ kinase activity after BCR-dependent activation. Accordingly, inUsp9Xknockout B cells, there was a significant reduction in phospho-CARMA1 levels that resulted in reduced CARMA1/Bcl-10/MALT-1 complex formation and NF-κB-dependent cell survival. The pleiotropic effect of Usp9X during Ag-receptor signaling highlights its importance for the development of an effective and durable adaptive immune response.	2016	08	16	J Immunol	Naik	Edwina
26947079	10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.031	CARMA3 Is a Host Factor Regulating the Balance of Inflammatory and Antiviral Responses against Viral Infection.	Host response to RNA virus infection is sensed by RNA sensors such as RIG-I, which induces MAVS-mediated NF-κB and IRF3 activation to promote inflammatory and antiviral responses, respectively. Here, we have found that CARMA3, a scaffold protein previously shown to mediate NF-κB activation induced by GPCR and EGFR, positively regulates MAVS-induced NF-κB activation. However, our data suggest that CARMA3 sequesters MAVS from forming high-molecular-weight aggregates, thereby suppressing TBK1/IRF3 activation. Interestingly, following NF-κB activation upon virus infection, CARMA3 is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation, which releases MAVS to activate IRF3. When challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza A virus, CARMA3-deficient mice showed reduced disease symptoms compared to those of wild-type mice as a result of less inflammation and a stronger ability to clear infected virus. Altogether, our results reveal the role of CARMA3 in regulating the balance of host antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses against RNA virus infection. 	2016	12	14	Cell Rep	Jiang	Changying
27006117	10.1242/jcs.185025	The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 during antigen receptor signaling.	Antigen-receptor-mediated activation of lymphocytes relies on a signalosome comprising CARMA1 (also known as CARD11), BCL10 and MALT1 (the CBM complex). The CBM activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors by recruiting the 'linear ubiquitin assembly complex' (LUBAC), and unleashes MALT1 paracaspase activity. Although MALT1 enzyme shapes NF-κB signaling, lymphocyte activation and contributes to lymphoma growth, the identity of its substrates continues to be elucidated. Here, we report that the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 (also known as RBCK1) is cleaved by MALT1 following antigen receptor engagement. HOIL1 is also constitutively processed in the 'activated B-cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which exhibits aberrant MALT1 activity. We further show that the overexpression of MALT1-insensitive HOIL1 mitigates T-cell-receptor-mediated NF-κB activation and subsequent cytokine production in lymphocytes. Thus, our results unveil HOIL1 as a negative regulator of lymphocyte activation cleaved by MALT1. This cleavage could therefore constitute an appealing therapeutic target for modulating immune responses.	2017	07	31	J Cell Sci	Douanne	Tiphaine

27070702	10.1016/j.ccell.2016.03.006	Targeting Non-proteolytic Protein Ubiquitination for the Treatment of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.	Chronic active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, a hallmark of the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), engages the CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 (CBM) adapter complex to activate IκB kinase (IKK) and the classical NF-κB pathway. Here we show that the CBM complex includes the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2, which are essential mediators of BCR-dependent NF-κB activity in ABC DLBCL. cIAP1/2 attach K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on themselves and on BCL10, resulting in the recruitment of IKK and the linear ubiquitin chain ligase LUBAC, which is essential for IKK activation. SMAC mimetics target cIAP1/2 for destruction, and consequently suppress NF-κB and selectively kill BCR-dependent ABC DLBCL lines, supporting their clinical evaluation in patients with ABC DLBCL. 	2016	09	08	Cancer Cell	Yang	Yibin
27071417	10.1042/BCJ20160270	Psoriasis mutations disrupt CARD14 autoinhibition promoting BCL10-MALT1-dependent NF-κB activation.	Inherited and de novo mutations in the CARD14 gene promote the development of psoriasis, an inflammatory disease of the skin. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 14 (CARD14) is a member of the CARMA protein family that includes the structurally related CARD11 adaptor that mediates NF-κB activation by antigen receptors. We investigated the mechanism by which CARD14 mutation in psoriasis activates NF-κB. In contrast with wild-type CARD14, CARD14(E138A) and CARD14(G117S) psoriasis mutants interacted constitutively with BCL10 and MALT1, and triggered BCL10- and MALT1-dependent activation of NF-κB in keratinocytes. These alterations disrupted the inhibitory effect of the CARD14 linker region (LR) on NF-κB activation by facilitating BCL10 binding. Therefore, psoriasis mutations activated CARD14 by a mechanism analogous to oncogenic CARD11 mutations in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. CARD14(E138A) also stimulated MALT1 paracaspase activity and activated both ERK1/2 and p38α MAP kinases. Inhibition of MALT1 with mepazine reduced CARD14(E138A)-induced expression of specific psoriasis-associated transcripts in keratinocytes. Our results establish the mechanism whereby gain-of-function CARD14 variants, which induce psoriatic disease in affected individuals, activate pro-inflammatory signalling.	2017	05	15	Biochem J	Howes	Ashleigh
27092298	10.3389/fcimb.2016.00039	Mechanistic Insights into the Role of C-Type Lectin Receptor/CARD9 Signaling in Human Antifungal Immunity.	Human CARD9 deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the gene CARD9, which encodes a signaling protein that is found downstream of many C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). CLRs encompass a large family of innate recognition receptors, expressed predominantly by myeloid and epithelial cells, which bind fungal carbohydrates and initiate antifungal immune responses. Accordingly, human CARD9 deficiency is associated with the spontaneous development of persistent and severe fungal infections that primarily localize to the skin and subcutaneous tissue, mucosal surfaces and/or central nervous system (CNS). In the last 3 years, more than 15 missense and nonsense CARD9 mutations have been reported which associate with the development of a wide spectrum of fungal infections caused by a variety of fungal organisms. The mechanisms by which CARD9 provides organ-specific protection against these fungal infections are now emerging. In this review, we summarize recent immunological and clinical advances that have provided significant mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of human CARD9 deficiency. We also discuss how genetic mutations in CARD9-coupled receptors (Dectin-1, Dectin-2) and CARD9-binding partners (MALT1, BCL10) affect human antifungal immunity relative to CARD9 deficiency, and we highlight major understudied research questions which merit future investigation. 	2016	11	11	Front Cell Infect Microbiol	Drummond	Rebecca A

27113748	10.15252/embr.201642109	The paracaspase MALT1 mediates CARD14-induced signaling in keratinocytes.	Mutations in CARD14 have recently been linked to psoriasis susceptibility. CARD14 is an epidermal regulator of NF-κB activation. However, the ability of CARD14 to activate other signaling pathways as well as the biochemical mechanisms that mediate and regulate its function remain to be determined. Here, we report that in addition to NF-κB signaling, CARD14 activates p38 and JNK MAP kinase pathways, all of which are dependent on the paracaspase MALT1. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CARD14 physically interacts with paracaspase MALT1 and activates MALT1 proteolytic activity and inflammatory gene expression, which are enhanced by psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations. Moreover, we show that MALT1 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 catalytic activity inhibits pathogenic mutant CARD14-induced cytokine and chemokine expression in human primary keratinocytes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a novel role for MALT1 in CARD14-induced signaling and indicate MALT1 as a valuable therapeutic target in psoriasis.	2017	08	15	EMBO Rep	Afonina	Inna S
27135977	10.1097/MOH.0000000000000257	Role of the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 complex in lymphoid malignancies.	The CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complex is a multimeric signaling complex controlling several important aspects of lymphocyte activation. Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding CBM proteins or their upstream regulators are associated with lymphoid malignancies, whereas loss-of-function mutations lead to immunodeficiency. This review reports on recent findings advancing our understanding of how CBM proteins contribute to malignant and nonmalignant hematological diseases in humans. Somatic gain-of-function mutations of CARMA1 (also known as CARD11), originally described for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, have recently been identified in patients with acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or Sézary syndrome, and in patients with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder known as BENTA. Loss-of-function mutations of CARMA1 and MALT1, on the other hand, have been reported to underlie human immunodeficiency. Lately, it has become clear that CBM-dependent signaling promotes lymphomagenesis not only via NF-κB activation, but also via the AP-1 family of transcription factors. The identification of new substrates of the protease MALT1 and the characterization of mice expressing catalytically inactive MALT1 have deepened our understanding of how the CBM complex controls lymphocyte proliferation through promoting MALT1's protease activity. The discovery of CARMA1 gain-of-function mutations in T-cell malignancies and BENTA patients, as well as the association of CARMA1 and MALT1 mutations with human immunodeficiency highlight the importance of CBM proteins in the regulation of lymphocyte functions, and suggest that the protease activity of MALT1 might be targeted to treat specific lymphoid malignancies.	2017	10	19	Curr Opin Hematol	Juilland	Mélanie
27452667	10.1016/j.semcancer.2016.07.003	MALT lymphoma: A paradigm of NF-κB dysregulation.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) invariably arises from a background of chronic microbial infection and/or autoimmune disorder at diverse mucosal sites. The prolonged chronic infection and/or autoimmunity generate active immune and inflammatory responses that provide a setting for evolution and development of autoreactive B-cells, their expansion and eventual malignant transformation following acquisition of genetic changes. The immune responses also play a critical role in sustaining the growth and survival of the transformed cells as shown by complete regression of a high proportion of MALT lymphoma of the stomach, ocular adnexa and skin following anti-microbial treatment. B-cell receptor engagement by auto-antigen as well as T-cell help including both cognate interaction and bystander help via soluble ligands such as CD40L and BAFF are thought to underpin the immunological drive in the lymphoma development through activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway respectively. Similarly, the three MALT lymphoma associated chromosome translocations, namely t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1,and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/BIRC3 (API2)-MALT1, are also capable of activating both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Furthermore, TNFAIP3 (A20) inactivation by deletion and/or mutation abolishes the auto-negative feedback to several signalling including BCR and TLR, which connect to the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Thus, there is a considerable overlap in the molecular pathways dysregulated by immunological drive and somatic genetic changes, strongly arguing for their oncogenic cooperation in the development of MALT lymphoma.	2017	12	18	Semin Cancer Biol	Du	Ming-Qing
27509941		E1/E2 of Hepatitis C Virus Genotype4 and Apoptosis.	Several studies have addressed the possible role of hepatitis C virus genotype4 (HCV GT4) in apoptosis. However, this still not fully understood. In the current study a reconstructed clone of E1/E2 polyprotein region of the HCV GT4 was transfected into the Huh7 cell line and a human apoptotic PCR array of 84 genes was used to investigate its possible significance for apoptosis. Out of the 84 genes, only 35 showed significant differential expression, 12 genes being upregulated and 23 downregulated. The highestup regulated genes were APAF1 (apoptotic peptidaseactivating factor 1), BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) and BCL 10 (Bcell CLL/ lymphoma protein 10) with fold regulation of 33.2, 30.1 and 18.9, respectively. The most downregulated were FAS (TNF receptor super family), TNFRSF10B (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10b) and FADD (FASassociated death domain) with fold regulation of 30.2, 27.7 and 14.9, respectively. These results suggest that the E1/E2 proteins may be involved in HCVinduced pathogenesis by modulating apoptosis through the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and disruption of the BCL2 gene family. 	2017	01	25	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Zekri	AbdelRahman N

The pathogenesis of ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue-type (OAML) is still poorly understood. We analyzed 63 cases of such lymphomas for non-synonymous mutations in 24 candidate genes by amplicon sequencing. We validated frequent mutations in the NF-κB regulators MYD88, TNFAIP3 and TNIP1 in OAML, but also identified recurrent mutations in several additional components of the NF-κB pathway, including BCL10 and NFKBIA. Overall, 60% of cases had mutations in at least one component of NF-κB signaling, pointing to a central role of its genetic deregulation in OAML pathogenesis. Mutations in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 were each found in 8% of cases, indicating a pathogenetic function of these factors in OAML. KMT2D was identified as the first epigenetic regulator with mutations in OAML, being mutated in 22% of cases. Mutations in MYD88 were associated with an inferior disease-free survival. Overall, we identified here highly recurrent genetic lesions in components of the NF-κB pathway, of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 as well as KMT2D in OAML and thereby provide major novel insights into the pathogenesis of this B cell malignancy.	2018	03	26	Oncotarget	Johansson	Patricia
27681433	10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.080	MALT1 Protease Activation Triggers Acute Disruption of Endothelial Barrier Integrity via CYLD Cleavage.	Microvascular endothelial cells maintain a tight barrier to prevent passage of plasma and circulating immune cells into the extravascular tissue compartment, yet endothelial cells respond rapidly to vasoactive substances, including thrombin, allowing transient paracellular permeability. This response is a cornerstone of acute inflammation, but the mechanisms responsible are still incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that thrombin triggers MALT1 to proteolytically cleave cylindromatosis (CYLD). Fragmentation of CYLD results in microtubule disruption and a cascade of events leading to endothelial cell retraction and an acute permeability response. This finding reveals an unexpected role for the MALT1 protease, which previously has been viewed mostly as a driver of pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling in lymphocytes. Thus, MALT1 not only promotes immune cell activation but also acutely regulates endothelial cell biology, actions that together facilitate tissue inflammation. Pharmacologic inhibition of MALT1 may therefore have synergistic impact by targeting multiple disparate steps in the overall inflammatory response.	2017	11	13	Cell Rep	Klei	Linda R
27777308	10.1074/jbc.M116.754028	Molecular Determinants of Scaffold-induced Linear Ubiquitinylation of B Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia 10 (Bcl10) during T Cell Receptor and Oncogenic Caspase Recruitment Domain-containing Protein 11 (CARD11) Signaling.	The activation of NF-κB downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement is a key signaling step required for normal lymphocyte function during the adaptive immune response. During TCR signaling, the adaptor protein Bcl10 is inducibly recruited to the CARD11 scaffold protein as part of a multicomponent complex that induces IκB kinase (IKK) activity and NF-κB activation. Here, we show that a consequence of this recruitment is the TCR-induced conjugation of Bcl10 with linear-linked polyubiquitin chains to generate the signaling intermediate Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10, which is required for the association of Bcl10 with the NEMO subunit of the IKK complex. The TCR-induced generation of Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10 requires Bcl10 lysines 17, 31, and 63, CARD11, MALT1, and the HOIP subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) but not the HOIP accessory protein SHARPIN. CARD11 promotes signal-induced Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10 generation by co-recruiting Bcl10 with HOIP, thereby bringing substrate to enzyme. The CARD11-HOIP interaction is rendered TCR-inducible by the four autoinhibitory repressive elements in the CARD11 inhibitory domain and involves the CARD11 coiled-coil domain and two independent regions of HOIP. Interestingly, oncogenic CARD11 variants associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma spontaneously induce Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10 production to extents that correlate with their abilities to activate NF-κB and with their enhanced abilities to bind HOIP and Bcl10. Our results define molecular determinants that control the production of Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10, an important signaling intermediate in TCR and oncogenic CARD11 signaling.	2017	05	26	J Biol Chem	Yang	Yong-Kang
24681956	10.1038/onc.2014.43	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 promotes oral cancer progression through STAT1/ATF4/S100P signaling pathway.	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) is an apoptotic regulatory protein related to advanced TNM stage and disease recurrence in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the regulatory mechanism of BCL10 in OSCC progression is still unknown. Here, we showed that knockdown of endogenous BCL10 could significantly reduce cell migration and invasion abilities, retard cell proliferation by G0/G1 phase accumulation and inhibit tumorigenicity in vivo. In molecular level, we identified S100P as a crucial downstream effector of BCL10-inhibited OSCC progression by high-throughput microarray analysis. S100P messenger RNA and protein expression levels were significantly diminished in silenced-BCL10 clones, and transfected S100P expression plasmids restored migration, invasion, proliferation abilities and tumorigenicity in shBCL10 transfectants. Furthermore, we provided evidence that BCL10 regulated S100P expression through signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of BCL10 decreased S100P promoter activity, but showed no effect in truncated STAT1/ATF4 S100P promoter.  In addition, we also found that the P50/P65 signaling pathway was involved in BCL10-enhanced OSCC progression. Restored S100P in silenced-BCL10 clones could markedly reverse P65 activation via outside-in signaling. Taken together, we discovered a novel axis of BCL10-regulated OSCC progression via STAT1/ATF4/S100P/P65 signaling, which could predict the prognosis of OSCC and will be beneficial for developing therapeutic strategy against advanced OSCC. 	2015	06	10	Oncogene	Wu	T-S
25391967	10.1007/s11060-014-1655-3	Differential expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system.	Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS DLBCL) is a distinct and aggressive lymphoma that is confined to CNS. Since, central nervous system is barrier-protected and immunologically silent; role of TLR/BCR signaling in pathogenesis and biology of CNS DLBCL is intriguing. Genomic mutations in key regulators of TLR/BCR signaling pathway (MYD88/CD79B/CARD11) have recently been reported in this disease. These observations raised possible implications in novel targeted therapies; however, expression pattern of molecules related to TLR/BCR pathways in this lymphoma remains unknown. We have analyzed the expression of 19 genes encoding TLR/BCR pathways and targets in CNS DLBCLs (n = 20) by Nanostring nCounter™ analysis and compared it with expression patterns in purified reactive B-lymphocytes and systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n = 20). Relative expression of TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, CD79B and BLNK was higher in CNS DLBCLs than in control B-lymphocytes; where as TLR7, MALT1, BCL10, CD79A and LYN was lower in CNS DLBCLs (P &lt; 0.0001). When compared with systemic DLBCL samples, higher expression of TLR9, CD79B, CARD11, LYN and BLNK was noted in CNS DLBCL (&gt;1.5 fold change; P &lt; 0.01). The B cell receptor molecules like BLNK and CD79B were also associated with higher expression of MYD88 dependent TLRs (TLR4/5/9). In conclusion, we have shown over expression of TLR/BCR related genes or their targets, where genomic mutations have commonly been identified in CNS DLBCL. We have also demonstrated that TLR over expression closely relate with up regulation of genes associated with BCR pathway like CD79B/BLNK and CARD11, which play an important role in NF-kB pathway activation. Our results provide an important insight into the possibility of TLR and/or B-cell receptor signaling molecules as possible therapeutic targets in CNS DLBCL.	2015	10	26	J Neurooncol	Akhter	Ariz
25556945	10.1016/j.chembiol.2014.10.021	Activity-based probes for detection of active MALT1 paracaspase in immune cells and lymphomas.	MALT1 paracaspase is activated upon antigen receptor stimulation to promote lymphocyte activation. In addition, deregulated MALT1 protease activity drives survival of distinct lymphomas such as the activated B cell type of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). Here, we designed fluorophore or biotin-coupled activity based-probes (ABP) that covalently modify the active center of MALT1. MALT1-ABPs are exclusively labeling an active modified full length form of MALT1 upon T cell stimulation. Further, despite the CARMA1 requirement for initial MALT1 activation, the MALT1-ABPs show that protease activity is not confined to the high-molecular CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. Using biotin-coupled ABPs, we developed a robust assay for sensitive and selective detection of active MALT1 in cell lines, primary lymphocytes, and DLBCL tumor biopsies. Taken together, MALT1-ABPs represent powerful chemical tools to measure cellular MALT1 activation, determine efficacy of small molecule inhibitors, and classify lymphomas based on MALT1 activity status.	2015	09	29	Chem Biol	Eitelhuber	Andrea C
25569716	10.1038/ncomms6908	Conversion of the LIMA1 tumour suppressor into an oncogenic LMO-like protein by API2-MALT1 in MALT lymphoma.	MALT1 is the only known paracaspase and is a critical mediator of B- and T-cell receptor signalling. The function of the MALT1 gene is subverted by oncogenic chimeric fusions arising from the recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21) aberration, which is the most frequent translocation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. API2-MALT1-positive MALT lymphomas manifest antibiotic resistance and aggressive clinical behaviour with poor clinical outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying API2-MALT1-induced MALT lymphomagenesis are not fully understood. Here we show that API2-MALT1 induces paracaspase-mediated cleavage of the tumour suppressor protein LIMA1. LIMA1 binding by API2-MALT1 is API2 dependent and proteolytic cleavage is dependent on MALT1 paracaspase activity. Intriguingly, API2-MALT1-mediated proteolysis generates a LIM domain-only (LMO)-containing fragment with oncogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, primary MALT lymphomas harbouring the API2-MALT1 fusion uniquely demonstrate LIMA1 cleavage fragments. Our studies reveal a novel paracaspase-mediated oncogenic gain-of-function mechanism in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma. 	2015	12	08	Nat Commun	Nie	Zilin
25736751	10.1007/978-1-4939-2422-6_12	Visualizing TCR-induced POLKADOTS formation and NF-κB activation in the D10 T-cell clone and mouse primary effector T cells.	T cells are an immune cell lineage that play a central role in protection against pathogen infection. Antigen, in the form of pathogen-derived peptides, stimulates the T-cell receptor (TCR), leading to activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The subsequent NF-κB-dependent gene expression program drives expansion and effector differentiation of antigen-specific T cells, leading to the adaptive anti-pathogen immune response. The cell surface TCR transmits activating signals to cytosolic NF-κB by a complex signaling cascade, in which the adapter protein Bcl10 plays a key role. We have previously demonstrated that TCR engagement leads to the formation of cytosolic Bcl10 clusters, called POLKADOTS, that provide a platform for the assembly of the terminal signaling complex that ultimately mediates NF-κB activation. In this chapter, we describe the methods utilized to visualize the formation of TCR-induced POLKADOTS and to study the temporal association between POLKADOTS formation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit, RelA/p65. 	2015	11	20	Methods Mol Biol	Paul	Suman
25748427	10.1371/journal.pone.0119363	MALT1-ubiquitination triggers non-genomic NF-κB/IKK signaling upon platelet activation.	We have recently shown that IKK complex plays an important non-genomic role in platelet function, i.e., regulates SNARE machinery-dependent membrane fusion. In this connection, it is well known that MALT1, whose activity is modulated by proteasome, plays an important role in the regulation of IKK complex. Therefore, the present studies investigated the mechanism by which IKK signaling is regulated in the context of the platelet proteasome. It was found that platelets express a functional proteasome, and form CARMA/MALT1/Bcl10 (CBM) complex when activated. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, the proteasome was found to regulate platelet function (aggregation, integrin activation, secretion, phosphatidylserine exposure and changes in intracellular calcium). It was also found to regulate thrombogenesis and physiologic hemostasis. We also observed, upon platelet activation, that MALT1 is ubiquitinated, and this coincides with the activation of the IKK/NF-κB-signaling pathway. Finally, we observed that the proteasome inhibitor blocks CBM complex formation and the interaction of IKKγ and MALT1; abrogates SNARE formation, and the association of MALT1 with TAK1 and TAB2, which are upstream of the CBM complex. Thus, our data demonstrate that MALT1 ubiquitination is critical for the engagement of CBM and IKK complexes, thereby directing platelet signals to the NF-κB pathway. 	2016	01	14	PLoS One	Karim	Zubair A
25849213	10.1371/journal.pone.0122365	Functional characterization of zebrafish (Danio rerio) Bcl10.	The complexes formed by BCL10, MALT1 and specific members of the family of CARMA proteins (CBM complex), have recently focused much attention because they represent a central hub regulating activation of the transcription factor NF-κB following various cellular stimulations. In this manuscript, we report the functional characterization of a Danio rerio 241 amino acids polypeptide ortholog of the Caspase recruiting domain (CARD)-containing protein BCL10. Biochemical studies show that zebrafish Bcl10 (zBcl10) dimerizes and binds to components of the CBM complex. Fluorescence microscopy observations demonstrate that zBcl10 forms cytoplasmic filaments similar to that formed by human BCL10 (hBCL10). Functionally, in human cells zBcl10 is more effective in activating NF-κB compared to hBCL10, possibly due to the lack of carboxy-terminal inhibitory serine residues present in the human protein. Also, depletion experiments carried out through expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting hBCL10 indicate that zBcl10 can functionally replace the human protein. Finally, we show that the zebrafish cell line PAC2 is suitable to carry out reporter assays for monitoring the activation state of NF- kB transcription factor. In conclusion, this work shows that zebrafish may excellently serve as a model organism to study complex and intricate signal transduction pathways, such as those that control NF-κB activation. 	2016	03	31	PLoS One	Mazzone	Pellegrino
25956014	10.1016/j.jaci.2015.02.037	Advances in basic and clinical immunology in 2014.	Genetic identification of immunodeficiency syndromes has become more efficient with the availability of whole-exome sequencing, expediting the identification of relevant genes and complementing traditional linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping. New genes defects causing immunodeficiency include phophoglucomutase 3 (PGM3), cytidine 5' triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1), nuclear factor κB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), phosphoinositide-3 kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), IL21, and Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1). New case reports expanded the clinical spectrum of gene defects. For example, a specific recombination-activating gene 1 variant protein with partial recombinant activity might produce Omenn syndrome or a common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. Central and peripheral B-cell tolerance was investigated in patients with several primary immunodeficiencies, including common variable immunodeficiency and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, to explain the occurrence of autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders. The role of IL-12 and IL-15 in the enhancement of natural killer cell activity was reported. Newborn screening for T-cell deficiency is being implemented in more states and is achieving its goal of defining the true incidence of severe combined immunodeficiency and providing early treatment that offers the highest survival for these patients. Definitive treatment of severe immunodeficiency with both hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy was reported to be successful, with increasing definition of conditions needed for optimal outcomes. Progress in HIV infection is directed toward the development of an effective vaccine and the eradication of hidden latent virus reservoirs. 	2015	07	23	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Chinen	Javier
25965667	10.1371/journal.pone.0127083	MALT1 Protease Activity Is Required for Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses.	CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 signalosomes play important roles in antigen receptor signaling and other pathways. Previous studies have suggested that as part of this complex, MALT1 functions as both a scaffolding protein to activate NF-κB through recruitment of ubiquitin ligases, and as a protease to cleave and inactivate downstream inhibitory signaling proteins. However, our understanding of the relative importance of these two distinct MALT1 activities has been hampered by a lack of selective MALT1 protease inhibitors with suitable pharmacologic properties. To fully investigate the role of MALT1 protease activity, we generated mice homozygous for a protease-dead mutation in MALT1. We found that some, but not all, MALT1 functions in immune cells were dependent upon its protease activity. Protease-dead mice had defects in the generation of splenic marginal zone and peritoneal B1 B cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed decreased T cell receptor-stimulated proliferation and IL-2 production while B cell receptor-stimulated proliferation was partially dependent on protease activity. In dendritic cells, stimulation of cytokine production through the Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle C-type lectin receptors was also found to be partially dependent upon protease activity. In vivo, protease-dead mice had reduced basal immunoglobulin levels, and showed defective responses to immunization with T-dependent and T-independent antigens. Surprisingly, despite these decreased responses, MALT1 protease-dead mice, but not MALT1 null mice, developed mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in multiple organs, suggesting MALT1 protease activity plays a role in immune homeostasis. These findings highlight the importance of MALT1 protease activity in multiple immune cell types, and in integrating immune responses in vivo. 	2016	02	19	PLoS One	Yu	Jong W
25973362	10.1016/j.fob.2015.04.011	Oligomerized CARD16 promotes caspase-1 assembly and IL-1β processing.	Increasing evidence indicates that caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-mediated caspase-1 (CASP1) assembly is an essential process for its activation and subsequent interleukin (IL)-1β release, leading to the initiation of inflammation. Both CARD16 and CARD17 were previously reported as inhibitory homologs of CASP1; however, their molecular function remains unclear. Here, we identified that oligomerization activity allows CARD16 to function as a CASP1 activator. We investigated the molecular characteristics of CARD16 and CARD17 in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Although both CARD16 and CARD17 interacted with CASP1CARD, only CARD16 formed a homo-oligomer. Oligomerized CARD16 formed a filament-like structure with CASP1CARD and a speck with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD. A filament-like structure formed by CARD16 promoted CASP1 filament assembly and IL-1β release. In contrast, CARD17 did not form a homo-oligomer or filaments and inhibited CASP1-dependent IL-1β release. Mutated CARD16D27G, mimicking the CARD17 amino acid sequence, formed a homo-oligomer but failed to form a filament-like structure. Consequently, CARD16D27G weakly promoted CASP1 filament assembly and subsequent IL-1β release. These results suggest that oligomerized CARD16 promotes CARD-mediated molecular assembly and CASP1 activation. 	2015	05	14	FEBS Open Bio	Karasawa	Tadayoshi
26038114	10.15252/msb.20145880	Systems-wide analysis of BCR signalosomes and downstream phosphorylation and ubiquitylation.	B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for the development and function of B cells; however, the spectrum of proteins involved in BCR signaling is not fully known. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to monitor the dynamics of BCR signaling complexes (signalosomes) and to investigate the dynamics of downstream phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling. We identify most of the previously known components of BCR signaling, as well as many proteins that have not yet been implicated in this system. BCR activation leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of the receptor-proximal signaling components, many of which are co-regulated by both the modifications. We illustrate the power of multilayered proteomic analyses for discovering novel BCR signaling components by demonstrating that BCR-induced phosphorylation of RAB7A at S72 prevents its association with effector proteins and with endo-lysosomal compartments. In addition, we show that BCL10 is modified by LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitylation, and demonstrate an important function of LUBAC in BCR-induced NF-κB signaling. Our results offer a global and integrated view of BCR signaling, and the provided datasets can serve as a valuable resource for further understanding BCR signaling networks. 	2016	03	01	Mol Syst Biol	Satpathy	Shankha
26202083	10.3892/ijmm.2015.2290	Bcl10 crucially nucleates the pro-apoptotic complexes comprising PDK1, PKCζ and caspase-3 at the nuclear envelope of etoposide-treated human cervical carcinoma C4-I cells.	Protein kinase (PK)Cζ signaling at various subcellular levels affects cell survival, differentiation, growth and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanisms modulating PKCζ activity at the nuclear membrane (NM) are not yet fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that PKCζ interacts with the B‑cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) protein at the NM of human cervical carcinoma (HCC) C4‑I cells. In the present study, we aimed to further clarify the interactions between PKCζ, Bcl10 and other proteins co-immunoprecipitated from NMs isolated from untreated and etoposide (also known as VP‑16; 2.0 µg/ml)‑treated C4‑I cells using biochemical and proteomics analyses. Aside from the Bcl10 protein, 3‑phosphoinositide‑dependent protein kinase‑1 (PDK1) also co-immunoprecipitated with PKCζ from NMs of C4‑I cells, indicating the assembly of a heterotrimeric complex, which increased with time in VP‑16‑exposed cells, as did the activity of PDK1‑phosphorylated‑PKCζ. In turn, PKCζ‑phosphorylated‑Bcl10 straddled an enlarged complex which comprised caspase‑3. Subsequently, activity‑enhanced caspase‑3 cleaved and inactivated PKCζ. Finally, the suppression of Bcl10 using specific siRNA or lentiviral transduction prevented the increase in the PDK1•PKCζ association, the increase in the activity of PKCζ and caspase‑3, as well as the caspase‑3‑mediated PKCζ proteolysis and inactivation from occurring at the NMs of the VP‑16‑exposed C4‑I cells. Our observations provide evidence that Bcl10 acts as a pivotal pro-apoptotic protein which crucially nucleates complexes comprising PDK1, PKCζ and active caspase‑3 at the NMs of VP‑16‑exposed C4‑I cells. Hence, our data suggest that Bcl10 and PKCζ are potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of HCC.	2016	05	09	Int J Mol Med	Chiarini	Anna
26277595	10.1016/j.jaci.2015.06.031	Genetic errors of the human caspase recruitment domain-B-cell lymphoma 10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma-translocation gene 1 (CBM) complex: Molecular, immunologic, and clinical heterogeneity.	Three members of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of adaptors (CARD9, CARD10, and CARD11) are known to form heterotrimers with B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma-translocation gene 1 (MALT1). These 3 CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complexes activate nuclear factor κB in both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity. Human inherited defects of the 3 components of the CBM complex, including the 2 adaptors CARD9 and CARD11 and the 2 core components BCL10 and MALT1, have recently been reported. Biallelic loss-of-function mutant alleles underlie several different immunologic and clinical phenotypes, which can be assigned to 2 distinct categories. Isolated invasive fungal infections of unclear cellular basis are associated with CARD9 deficiency, whereas a broad range of clinical manifestations, including those characteristic of T- and B-lymphocyte defects, are associated with CARD11, MALT1, and BCL10 deficiencies. Interestingly, human subjects with these mutations have some features in common with the corresponding knockout mice, but other features are different between human subjects and mice. Moreover, germline and somatic gain-of-function mutations of MALT1, BCL10, and CARD11 have also been found in patients with other lymphoproliferative disorders. This broad range of germline and somatic CBM lesions, including loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations, highlights the contribution of each of the components of the CBM complex to human immunity. 	2016	02	29	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Pérez de Diego	Rebeca

26525107	10.1038/ncomms9777	The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves HOIL1 reducing linear ubiquitination by LUBAC to dampen lymphocyte NF-κB signalling.	Antigen receptor signalling activates the canonical NF-κB pathway via the CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome involving key, yet ill-defined roles for linear ubiquitination. The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves and removes negative checkpoint proteins, amplifying lymphocyte responses in NF-κB activation and in B-cell lymphoma subtypes. To identify new human MALT1 substrates, we compare B cells from the only known living MALT1(mut/mut) patient with healthy MALT1(+/mut) family members using 10-plex Tandem Mass Tag TAILS N-terminal peptide proteomics. We identify HOIL1 of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex as a novel MALT1 substrate. We show linear ubiquitination at B-cell receptor microclusters and signalosomes. Late in the NF-κB activation cycle HOIL1 cleavage transiently reduces linear ubiquitination, including of NEMO and RIP1, dampening NF-κB activation and preventing reactivation. By regulating linear ubiquitination, MALT1 is both a positive and negative pleiotropic regulator of the human canonical NF-κB pathway-first promoting activation via the CBM--then triggering HOIL1-dependent negative-feedback termination, preventing reactivation.	2016	05	10	Nat Commun	Klein	Theo
26615705	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2015.10.001	Antisecretory medication is associated with decreased Helicobacter pylori detection in gastric marginal zone lymphoma.	Helicobacter pylori status influences the prognosis and management of gastric extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma), so accurate determination of H pylori status is of clinical importance. The low rate of histologic H pylori positivity among gastric MALT lymphoma cases at our institution prompted investigation for possible causes. A case series of 24 patients as having gastric MALT lymphoma (with no diffuse large B-cell component) in a tertiary care setting between 1997 and 2010 was identified, and clinical records were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for H pylori and BCL10 was performed. This study received institutional review board approval (protocol number M13-033). Thirty-nine percent of cases (9/23) were H pylori positive by histology, and 4 additional patients had positive serologic results; overall, 57% of cases (13/23) were positive for H pylori. Treatment with antisecretory medications was associated with a lower likelihood of histologic positivity (13% among treated patients vs 75% among untreated; P = .04). Nuclear localization of BCL10 was seen in 2 cases and was not associated with H pylori status. Antisecretory medications decrease the likelihood of histologic detection of H pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma cases. Incorporation of results of serologic or other testing is needed to ensure correct classification with respect to H pylori status.	2016	09	15	Ann Diagn Pathol	Schaberg	Kurt B
26668357	10.1073/pnas.1507459112	Lymphomagenic CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 signaling drives malignant B-cell proliferation via cooperative NF-κB and JNK activation.	The aggressive activated B cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is characterized by aberrant B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and constitutive nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activation, which is required for tumor cell survival. BCR-induced NF-κB activation requires caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11), and CARD11 gain-of-function mutations are recurrently detected in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To investigate the consequences of dysregulated CARD11 signaling in vivo, we generated mice that conditionally express the human DLBCL-derived CARD11(L225LI) mutant. Surprisingly, CARD11(L225LI) was sufficient to trigger aggressive B-cell lymphoproliferation, leading to early postnatal lethality. CARD11(L225LI) constitutively associated with B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) to simultaneously activate the NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascades. Genetic deficiencies of either BCL10 or MALT1 completely rescued the phenotype, and pharmacological inhibition of JNK was, similar to NF-κB blockage, toxic to autonomously proliferating CARD11(L225LI)-expressing B cells. Moreover, constitutive JNK activity was observed in primary human activated B cell-like (ABC)-DLBCL specimens, and human ABC-DLBCL cells were also sensitive to JNK inhibitors. Thus, our results demonstrate that enforced activation of CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 signaling is sufficient to drive transformed B-cell expansion in vivo and identify the JNK pathway as a therapeutic target for ABC-DLBCL. 	2016	08	11	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Knies	Nathalie
26711259	10.1128/MCB.00876-15	Negative Regulation of CARD11 Signaling and Lymphoma Cell Survival by the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF181.	NF-κB activation downstream of antigen receptor engagement is a highly regulated event required for lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. The pathway is often dysregulated in lymphoma, leading to constitutive NF-κB activity that supports the aberrant proliferation of transformed lymphocytes. To identify novel regulators of antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, we developed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based interaction cloning (BRIC), a screening strategy that can detect protein-protein interactions in live mammalian cells in a high-throughput manner. Using this strategy, we identified the RING finger protein RNF181 as an interactor of CARD11, a key signaling scaffold in the antigen receptor pathway. We present evidence that RNF181 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to inhibit antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB downstream of CARD11. The levels of the obligate signaling protein Bcl10 are reduced by RNF181 even prior to signaling, and Bcl10 can serve as a substrate for RNF181 E3 ligase activity in vitro. Furthermore, RNF181 limits the proliferation of human diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells that depend upon aberrant CARD11 signaling to NF-κB for growth and survival in culture. Our results define a new regulatory checkpoint that can modulate the output of CARD11 signaling to NF-κB in both normal and transformed lymphocytes. 	2016	07	06	Mol Cell Biol	Pedersen	Sarah M
23846624	10.14670/HH-29.77	BCL10 expression and localization in ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas: a comparative cytogenetic and immunohistochemical study.	T(1;14) (p22;q32) involving BCL10 and IGH genes is a rare but recurrent chromosomal aberration in MALT-type lymphoma. It is rarely described in ocular adnexa B cell lymphomas, although nuclear BCL10 shuttling seems to be critical for disease progression in this district. We have evaluated the translocations MALT lymphoma-related in a series of 45 ocular adnexa cases, focusing in particular on their relation with BCL10 expression and its cellular topographic distribution. A prognostic tissue microarray (TMA) with ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas was designed. A study of BCL10 expression and its topographic distribution was performed through immunohistochemistry. In addition the assessment of t(14;18) (q32;q21), t(1;14) (p22;q32) and t(11;18) (q21;q21) was determined by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH). Our series revealed t(14;18) (q32;q21) in 6/43 cases (14,3%). t(1;14) (p22;q32), never described in ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas, was observed in 3/31 (9,7%), two of which exhibited the gain of 3' upstream BCL10 gene signal (4%), whereas no case showed t(11;18) (q21;q21). Moreover, BCL10 expression was observed in 18/45 cases. In particular its nuclear expression was revealed in 12/45 cases, cytoplasmic expression in 5/45 and both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in 1/45. Statistical analysis demonstrated that while BCL10 cytoplasmic expression is significantly related to the presence of the investigated chromosomal aberrations, in particular with t(14;18) (q32;q21), BCL10 nuclear shuttling does not show any correlation with these translocations. Our data support that BCL10 nuclear distribution is neither related to BCL10 rearrangement nor to other known translocations.	2014	08	28	Histol Histopathol	Cerrone	Margherita
23886693	10.1016/j.imbio.2013.06.013	Activation of NF-κB and respiratory burst following Aspergillus fumigatus stimulation of macrophages.	Dectin-2, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR), plays an essential role in mediating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and anti-fungal immunity in response to Candida albicans infection. However, the molecular mechanisms and function of Dectin-2 signaling in response to infection by the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus have not been characterized. In order to characterize Dectin-2 signaling in response to A. fumigatus infection, activation of Dectin-2 was analyzed at both transcriptional and translational levels. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation, NF-κB activation and cytokine production downstream of Dectin-2 activation were also investigated. In addition, Dectin-2-Syk function and its ability to mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination of A. fumigatus conidia was examined. We demonstrate that Syk is involved in Dectin-2-induced IκBα (inhibitor of kappa B protein) phosphorylation and NF-κB activation following A. fumigatus stimulation in a time dependent manner. Silencing of Dectin-2 and Syk as well as Syk inhibition blocks NF-κB activation and cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the killing of A. fumigatus conidia and ROS production are significantly affected by Dectin-2 or Syk silencing as well as Syk inhibition. Swelling and germination of the fungus followed by hyphae formation and not the resting and heat-inactivated form of A. fumigatus mediate the activation of Dectin-2 signaling. In conclusion, Syk plays an essential role in IκBα kinase phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and ROS production mediated by Dectin-2 activation in response to A. fumigatus infection. 	2014	07	25	Immunobiology	Sun	He
24329526	10.1089/dna.2013.2199	The TCR γδ repertoire and relative gene expression characteristics of T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells.	Despite significant improvement in our understanding of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) biology and pathogenesis, many questions remain unanswered. In previous studies, we found a T-ALL case with two malignant T-cell clones with Vδ1Dδ2Dδ3Jδ1 and Vδ2Dδ3Jδ2 rearrangements. In this study, we further characterized T-ALL cases with two malignant clones containing Vδ1Dδ3Jδ1 and Vδ2Dδ1Jδ1 rearrangements using fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), sequencing, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. We further analyzed the distribution and clonality of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vγ and Vδ subfamily T cells in the two T-ALL cases by RT-PCR and GeneScan. Monoclonal Vδ1 and Vδ2 subfamilies were confirmed in both samples, the Vδ3 through Vδ7 subfamilies could not be detected in the T-ALL samples, whereas the oligoclonal Vδ8 subfamily could be identified. Based on the clinical finding that both of the T-ALL cases with two malignant T-cell clones had a poor outcome, we attempted to compare the expression pattern of genes related to T-cell activation and proliferation between cases with the malignant Vδ1 and Vδ2 T-cell clones and T-ALL cases with a mono-malignant Vα T-cell clone. We selected two T-ALL cases with VαJα rearrangements and analyzed the expression level of Notch1, TAL1, and the CARMA-BCL10-MALT-A20-NF-κB pathway genes by real-time PCR. A20 had significantly higher expression in the biclonal compared with the monoclonal T-ALL group (p=0.0354), and there was a trend toward higher expression for the other genes in the biclonal group with the exception of TAL1, although the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we identified two T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant T-cell clones and described the characteristics of the biclonal T-ALL subtype and its gene expression pattern. Thus, our findings may improve the understanding of biclonal T-ALL. 	2014	03	03	DNA Cell Biol	Zheng	Haitao
24375035	10.1002/jcp.24543	The three CARMA sisters: so different, so similar: a portrait of the three CARMA proteins and their involvement in human disorders.	Initially identified by their ability to modulate the functional activity of BCL10, the three CARMA proteins, CARMA1, -2, and -3, have recently themselves taken a leading role on the stage of molecular medicine. Although considered for some time as simple ancillary proteins, increasingly accumulating recent data evidently indicate a role of primary importance for these three proteins in the pathophysiology of several human tumors and inflammatory disorders. In fact, recent scientific literature clearly establishes that CARMA1 is one of the most mutated genes in a subtype of B-cell lymphoma and, at the same time, responsible for some rare human immunodeficiency conditions. On the other hand, mutations in CARMA2 are responsible for the hereditary transmission of some inflammatory disorders of the skin, including familial psoriasis and ptiriasis; whereas expression of CARMA3 appears to be deregulated in different human tumors. Here we describe and summarize the mutations found in the genes coding for the three CARMA proteins in these different human pathological conditions, and offer an interpretation of the molecular mechanisms from which arise the biological outcomes in which these proteins are involved.	2014	07	21	J Cell Physiol	Scudiero	Ivan
24383645	10.1111/imm.12207	N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis in the mouse provides strong genetic and in vivo evidence for the role of the Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD) of CARD-MAGUK1 in T regulatory cell development.	Natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells generated in the thymus are essential throughout life for the maintenance of T-cell homeostasis and the prevention of autoimmunity. T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD28-mediated activation of nuclear factor-κB and (J)un (N)-terminal kinase pathways is known to play a key role in nTreg cell development but many of the predicted molecular interactions are based on extrapolations from non-Treg cell TCR stimulation with non-physiological ligands. For the first time, we provide strong genetic evidence of a scaffold function for the Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD) of the TCR signalling protein CARD-MAGUK1 (CARMA1) in nTreg cell development in vivo. We report two, new, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-derived mutant mice, Vulpo and Zerda, with a profound block in the development of nTreg cells in the thymus as well as impaired inducible Treg cell differentiation in the periphery. Despite independent heritage, both mutants harbour different point mutations in the CARD of the CARMA1 protein. Mutations in vulpo and zerda do not affect expression levels of CARMA1 but still impair signalling through the TCR due to defective downstream Bcl-10 recruitment by the mutated CARD of CARMA1. Phenotypic differences observed between Vulpo and Zerda mutants suggest a role for the CARD of CARMA1 independent of Bcl-10 activation of downstream pathways. We conclude that our forward genetic approach demonstrates a critical role for the CARD function of CARMA1 in Treg cell development in vivo.	2014	05	15	Immunology	Salisbury	Emma M
24411492	10.1016/j.cytogfr.2013.12.008	The CBM signalosome: potential therapeutic target for aggressive lymphoma?	The CBM signalosome plays a pivotal role in mediating antigen-receptor induced NF-κB signaling to regulate lymphocyte functions. The CBM complex forms filamentous structure and recruits downstream signaling components to activate NF-κB. MALT1, the protease component in the CBM complex, cleaves key proteins in the feedback loop of the NF-κB signaling pathway and enhances NF-κB activation. The aberrant activity of the CBM complex has been linked to aggressive lymphoma. Recent years have witnessed dramatic progresses in understanding the assembly mechanism of the CBM complex, and advances in the development of targeted therapy for aggressive lymphoma. Here, we will highlight these progresses and give an outlook on the potential translation of this knowledge from bench to bedside for aggressive lymphoma patients. 	2015	01	10	Cytokine Growth Factor Rev	Yang	Chenghua
24443940	10.1111/cei.12275	CARD11 blockade suppresses murine collagen-induced arthritis via inhibiting CARD11/Bcl10 assembly and T helper type 17 response.	The scaffold protein caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11) is implicated in the regulation of inflammation and autoimmunity. The present study aimed to explore the role of CARD11 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated with either CARD11-targeted interfering RNA (CARD11 siRNA) or control siRNA by intraperitoneal injection every 3 days after CIA establishment. The clinical score of arthritis was recorded every other day. Synovial inflammation and cartilage erosion were evaluated by histology and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Serum anti-type II collagen (anti-CII) antibodies and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The CARD11/Bcl10 formation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation was assessed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, and the percentage of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells was determined by flow cytometry. Systemic administration of CARD11 siRNA significantly reduced the clinical score of CIA severity. As indicated by the histology, joint inflammation and destruction were attenuated by CARD11 siRNA treatment. Micro-CT demonstrated less severe joint destruction in CARD11 siRNA-treated mice than in control mice. CARD11 siRNA treatment resulted in inhibition of CARD11/Bcl10 formation and the subsequent NF-κB activation. In addition, treatment with CARD11 siRNA resulted in a pronounced decrease in proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-17. Serum anti-CII antibody and the percentage of Th17 cells were also significantly reduced. CARD11 is involved in the pathogenesis of CIA by formation of the CARD11/Bcl10 complex and enhancement of the Th17 cell response. Targeting CARD11 provides a novel research direction in the development of therapeutic strategies for RA. 	2014	06	20	Clin Exp Immunol	Wang	H
24491438	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0915	Essential role of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex in lymphoma revealed by rare germline polymorphisms.	Constitutive activation of NF-κB is a hallmark of the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), owing to upstream signals from the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MYD88 pathways. The linear polyubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear polyubiquitin chains to IκB kinase-γ, a necessary event in some pathways that engage NF-κB. Two germline polymorphisms affecting the LUBAC subunit RNF31 are rare among healthy individuals (∼1%) but enriched in ABC DLBCL (7.8%). These polymorphisms alter RNF31 α-helices that mediate binding to the LUBAC subunit RBCK1, thereby increasing RNF31-RBCK1 association, LUBAC enzymatic activity, and NF-κB engagement. In the BCR pathway, LUBAC associates with the CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 adapter complex and is required for ABC DLBCL viability. A stapled RNF31 α-helical peptide based on the ABC DLBCL-associated Q622L polymorphism inhibited RNF31-RBCK1 binding, decreased NF-κB activation, and killed ABC DLBCL cells, credentialing this protein-protein interface as a therapeutic target. We provide genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence that the LUBAC ubiquitin ligase is a therapeutic target in ABC DLBCL, the DLBCL subtype that is most refractory to current therapy. More generally, our findings highlight the role of rare germline-encoded protein variants in cancer pathogenesis.	2014	11	24	Cancer Discov	Yang	Yibin
24497531	10.1182/blood-2013-05-504019	A catalytic-independent role for the LUBAC in NF-κB activation upon antigen receptor engagement and in lymphoma cells.	Antigen receptor-mediated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation relies on the formation of a large multi-protein complex that contains CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex). This signalosome is pirated in the activated B-cell-like subgroup of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL) to drive aberrant NF-κB activation, thereby promoting cell survival and propagation. Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we screened for additional components of the CBM in lymphocytes. We found that the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which was previously linked to cytokine-mediated NF-κB activation, dynamically integrates the CBM and marshals NF-κB optimal activation following antigen receptor ligation independently of its catalytic activity. The LUBAC also participates in preassembled CBM complex in cells derived from ABC DLBCL. Silencing the LUBAC reduced NF-κB activation and was toxic in ABC DLBCL cell lines. Thus, our findings reveal a role for the LUBAC during lymphocyte activation and in B-cell malignancy. 	2014	06	09	Blood	Dubois	Sonia M
24548923	10.1016/j.molimm.2014.01.011	Phosphorylation of Carma1, but not Bcl10, by Akt regulates TCR/CD28-mediated NF-κB induction and cytokine production.	Previous studies from our group and others have shown that the Akt kinase can contribute to induction of NF-κB by antigen receptor signaling. However, the direct targets of Akt in this pathway are not known. Here we show that Akt-mediated NF-κB activation is mediated at least in part through direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Carma1, which we previously demonstrated could interact with Akt in a TCR ligation-dependent manner. The putative Akt phosphorylation sites in Carma1 are distinct from known PKC consensus sites. Mutation of S551, S637 and S645 in Carma1 to non-phosphorylatable residues decreased phosphorylation of GST-Carma1-linker construct by Akt in vitro. In addition, Carma1 S637A/S645A mutants were significantly impaired in their ability to restore TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-2 expression in Carma1-deficient T cells. Thus, our data reveal Carma1 as a novel target for Akt phosphorylation and suggest that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Carma1 is an additional regulatory mechanism tuning the NF-κB response downstream of antigen receptor and co-stimulatory signaling.	2014	06	07	Mol Immunol	Cheng	Jing

24633921	10.1007/s13277-014-1791-6	CARMA3 is upregulated in human pancreatic carcinoma, and its depletion inhibits tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion.	Elevated CARMA3 expression has been reported to be involved in tumor progression of several cancer types. In the present study, we examined the expression pattern of CARMA3 protein and its biological roles in human pancreatic carcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry, we checked CARMA3 protein expression in 95 pancreatic ductal carcinoma specimens. We found that CARMA3 was overexpressed in 34 of 95 (35.8 %) specimens. A significant association was observed between CARMA3 overexpression with histological grade (p=0.0099) and nodal status (p=0.0126). To further explore its biological roles, we knocked down CARMA3 expression in CAPAN2 cell line using small interfering RNA (siRNA). MTT growth assay, wound healing assay, and Transwell assay showed that CARMA3 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We also showed that CARMA3 depletion inhibited EGF-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation and its target genes' expression. The effect of CARMA3 depletion on NF-κB signaling was significantly reduced in Bcl10-depleted cells. In conclusion, CARMA3 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and regulates malignant cell growth, invasion, and NF-κB signaling, which was dependent on its association with Bcl10.	2014	08	19	Tumour Biol	Du	Shiyu
24641824	10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.03.011	Degraded λ-carrageenan activates NF-κB and AP-1 pathways in macrophages and enhances LPS-induced TNF-α secretion through AP-1.	Carrageenan (CGN), a high molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide, is a traditional ingredient used in food industry. Its degraded forms have been identified as potential carcinogens, although the mechanism remains unclear. The effects of degraded λ-carrageenan (λ-dCGN) on murine RAW264.7 cells and human THP-1-derived macrophage cells were investigated by studying its actions on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, and activation of nuclear factor-κb (NF-κB) and activation protein-1 (AP-1) pathways. We found that λ-dCGN was much stronger than native λ-CGN in the activation of macrophages to secrete TNF-α. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with λ-dCGN resulted in the upregulation of TLR4, CD14 and MD-2 expressions, but it did not increase the binding of lipopolysacchride (LPS) with macrophages. Meanwhile, λ-dCGN treatment activated NF-κB via B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation. In addition, λ-dCGN induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases/1/2/mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2/MAPK) and AP-1 activation. Interestingly, pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with λ-dCGN markedly enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF-α secretion. This pretreatment resulted in the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and intensified activation of AP-1. λ-dCGN induced an inflammatory reaction via both NF-κB and AP-1, and enhanced the inflammatory effect of LPS through AP-1 activation. The study demonstrated the role of λ-dCGN to induce the inflammatory reaction and to aggravate the effect of LPS on macrophages, suggesting that λ-dCGN produced during food processing and gastric digestion may be a safety concern.	2014	08	18	Biochim Biophys Acta	Chen	Haimin
24702227	10.3109/00016489.2013.878474	Increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.	The increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs indicates that these pattern recognition receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. Changes in expression of pattern recognition receptors may be associated with immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. We therefore assessed the levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs associated with innate immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma specimens were collected from 23 patients diagnosed with acquired cholesteatoma from August 2010 to July 2012. The posterior auricular skin of each patient was used as control. The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA were assessed quantitatively using real-time RT-PCR and correlated with sex, hearing level, the presence of bacteria, and the need for repeat surgery. The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p &lt; 0.05 each). However, mRNA abundance was not associated with patient sex, hearing level, presence of bacteria or history of reoperation (p &gt; 0.05 each).	2014	12	28	Acta Otolaryngol	Kim	Myung Gu
24732096	10.4161/cc.28707	BCL10 regulates RNF8/RNF168-mediated ubiquitination in the DNA damage response.	Timely and proper cellular response to DNA damage is essential for maintenance of genome stability and integrity. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) facilitates ubiquitination of NEMO in the cytosol, activating NFκB signaling. Translocation and/or point mutations of BCL10 associate with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and other malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which the resulting aberrant expression of BCL10 leads to cellular oncogenesis are poorly understood. In this report, we found that BCL10 in the nucleus is enriched at the DNA damage sites in an ATM- and RNF8-dependent manner. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BCL10 promotes its interaction with and presentation of UBC13 to RNF8, and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination of BCL10 enhances binding of BCL10 and UBC13 to RNF168. This allows mono-ubiquitination on H2AX by RNF168 and further poly-ubiquitination by the RNF8/RNF168-containing complex. Depletion of BCL10 compromised homology recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair because of insufficient recruitment of BRCA1, RAD51, and the ubiquitinated DNA damage response factors. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel function of BCL10 in delivering UBC13 to RNF8/RNF168 to regulate ubiquitination-mediated DSB signaling and repair. 	2015	01	12	Cell Cycle	Zhao	Hongchang
24777530	10.1038/ni.2888	Rad50-CARD9 interactions link cytosolic DNA sensing to IL-1β production.	Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm triggers the production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) as an antiviral host response, and deregulation of the pathways involved can promote inflammatory disease. Here we report a direct cytosolic interaction between the DNA-damage sensor Rad50 and the innate immune system adaptor CARD9. Transfection of dendritic cells with dsDNA or infection of dendritic cells with a DNA virus induced the formation of dsDNA-Rad50-CARD9 signaling complexes for activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the generation of pro-IL-1β. Primary cells conditionally deficient in Rad50 or lacking CARD9 consequently exhibited defective DNA-induced production of IL-1β, and Card9(-/-) mice had impaired inflammatory responses after infection with a DNA virus in vivo. Our results define a cytosolic DNA-recognition pathway for inflammation and a physical and functional connection between a conserved DNA-damage sensor and the innate immune response to pathogens. 	2014	07	28	Nat Immunol	Roth	Susanne
24792914	10.1016/j.immuni.2014.04.007	Inflammatory T cell responses rely on amino acid transporter ASCT2 facilitation of glutamine uptake and mTORC1 kinase activation.	Glutamine has been implicated as an immunomodulatory nutrient, but how glutamine uptake is mediated during T cell activation is poorly understood. We have shown that naive T cell activation is coupled with rapid glutamine uptake, which depended on the amino acid transporter ASCT2. ASCT2 deficiency impaired the induction of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells and attenuated inflammatory T cell responses in mouse models of immunity and autoimmunity. Mechanistically, ASCT2 was required for T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated activation of the metabolic kinase mTORC1. We have further shown that TCR-stimulated glutamine uptake and mTORC1 activation also required a TCR signaling complex composed of the scaffold protein CARMA1, the adaptor molecule BCL10, and the paracaspase MALT1. This function was independent of IKK kinase, a major downstream target of the CARMA1 complex. These findings highlight a mechanism of T cell activation involving ASCT2-dependent integration of the TCR signal and a metabolic signaling pathway.	2014	07	09	Immunity	Nakaya	Mako
24806599	10.1038/ncomms4755	An ITAM-Syk-CARD9 signalling axis triggers contact hypersensitivity by stimulating IL-1 production in dendritic cells.	A variety of reactive organic compounds, called haptens, can cause allergic contact dermatitis. However, the innate immune mechanisms by which haptens stimulate dendritic cells (DCs) to sensitize T cells remain unclear. Here we show that the coupling of ITAM-Syk-CARD9 signalling to interleukin-1 (IL-1) secretion in DCs is crucial for allergic sensitization to haptens. Both MyD88 and Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) signalling are required for contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Naïve T cells require signals received through IL-1R1-MyD88 for effector differentiation, whereas DCs require CARD9 and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signalling for hapten-induced IL-1α/β secretion and their ability to prime T cells. DC-specific deletion of CARD9, DAP12, Syk or NLRP3, but not MyD88, is sufficient to abolish CHS. All tested haptens, but not irritants, can induce Syk activation, leading to both the CARD9/BCL10-dependent pro-IL-1 synthesis (signal1) and reactive oxygen species-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation (signal2), required for IL-1 secretion. These data unveil an innate immune mechanism crucial for allergic contact sensitization to chemical compounds. 	2015	08	04	Nat Commun	Yasukawa	Shinsuke
24825920	10.1126/scisignal.2004882	T cell receptor signals to NF-κB are transmitted by a cytosolic p62-Bcl10-Malt1-IKK signalosome.	Antigen-mediated stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a key transcriptional regulator of T cell proliferation and effector cell differentiation. TCR signaling to NF-κB requires both the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex and the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex; however, the molecular mechanisms connecting the CBM complex to activation of IKK are incompletely defined. We found that the active IKK complex is a component of a TCR-dependent cytosolic Bcl10-Malt1 signalosome containing the adaptor protein p62, which forms in effector T cells. Phosphorylated IκBα and NF-κB were transiently recruited to this signalosome before NF-κB translocated to the nucleus. Inhibiting the activity of the kinase TAK1 or IKK blocked the phosphorylation of IKK, but not the formation of p62-Bcl10-Malt1 clusters, suggesting that activation of IKK occurs after signalosome assembly. Furthermore, analysis of T cells from p62-deficient mice demonstrated that the p62-dependent clustering of signaling components stimulated activation of NF-κB in effector T cells. Thus, TCR-stimulated activation of NF-κB requires the assembly of cytosolic p62-Bcl10-Malt1-IKK signalosomes, which may ensure highly regulated activation of NF-κB in response to TCR engagement. 	2014	12	31	Sci Signal	Paul	Suman
24917592	10.1126/scisignal.2005169	T cell receptor-dependent activation of mTOR signaling in T cells is mediated by Carma1 and MALT1, but not Bcl10.	Signaling to the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates diverse cellular processes, including protein translation, cellular proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy. Most models place Akt upstream of the mTOR complex, mTORC1; however, in T cells, Akt may not be necessary for mTORC1 activation. We found that the adaptor protein Carma1 [caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing membrane-associated protein 1] and at least one of its associated proteins, the paracaspase MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), were required for optimal activation of mTOR in T cells in response to stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the co-receptor CD28. However, Bcl10, which binds to Carma1 and MALT1 to form a complex that mediates signals from the TCR to the transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB), was not required. The catalytic activity of MALT1 was required for the proliferation of stimulated CD4+ T cells, but not for early TCR-dependent activation events. Consistent with an effect on mTOR, MALT1 activity was required for the increased metabolic flux in activated CD4+ T cells. Together, our data suggest that Carma1 and MALT1 play previously unappreciated roles in the activation of mTOR signaling in T cells after engagement of the TCR.	2015	02	12	Sci Signal	Hamilton	Kristia S
24958727	10.1074/jbc.M114.588723	The adaptor CRADD/RAIDD controls activation of endothelial cells by proinflammatory stimuli.	A hallmark of inflammation, increased vascular permeability, is induced in endothelial cells by multiple agonists through stimulus-coupled assembly of the CARMA3 signalosome, which contains the adaptor protein BCL10. Previously, we reported that BCL10 in immune cells is targeted by the ""death"" adaptor CRADD/RAIDD (CRADD), which negatively regulates nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-dependent cytokine and chemokine expression in T cells (Lin, Q., Liu, Y., Moore, D. J., Elizer, S. K., Veach, R. A., Hawiger, J., and Ruley, H. E. (2012) J. Immunol. 188, 2493-2497). This novel anti-inflammatory CRADD-BCL10 axis prompted us to analyze CRADD expression and its potential anti-inflammatory action in non-immune cells. We focused our study on microvascular endothelial cells because they play a key role in inflammation. We found that CRADD-deficient murine endothelial cells display heightened BCL10-mediated expression of the pleotropic proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in response to LPS and thrombin. Moreover, these agonists also induce significantly increased permeability in cradd(-/-), as compared with cradd(+/+), primary murine endothelial cells. CRADD-deficient cells displayed more F-actin polymerization with concomitant disruption of adherens junctions. In turn, increasing intracellular CRADD by delivery of a novel recombinant cell-penetrating CRADD protein (CP-CRADD) restored endothelial barrier function and suppressed the induction of IL-6 and MCP-1 evoked by LPS and thrombin. Likewise, CP-CRADD enhanced barrier function in CRADD-sufficient endothelial cells. These results indicate that depletion of endogenous CRADD compromises endothelial barrier function in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, we define a novel function for CRADD in endothelial cells as an inducible suppressor of BCL10, a key mediator of responses to proinflammatory agonists. 	2015	02	19	J Biol Chem	Qiao	Huan
25011391	10.1007/s00418-014-1244-8	Combining immunofluorescence with in situ proximity ligation assay: a novel imaging approach to monitor protein-protein interactions in relation to subcellular localization.	The in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is suited for visualizing protein-protein interactions and post-translational protein modifications in both tissue sections and in vitro cell cultures. Accurate identification and quantification of protein-protein interactions are critical for in vitro cell analysis, especially when studying the dynamic involvement of proteins in various processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here, we monitored the interactions between protein kinase-Cζ (PKCζ) and Bcl10 protein in untreated and etoposide (VP-16)-treated C4-I cells by means of a new combined morphological approach and validated it by taking stock of our previous proteomic and biochemical work (Chiarini et al. in J Proteome Res 11:3996-4012, 2012). We first analyzed the colocalization of PKCζ and Bcl10 proteins through classical immunofluorescent colocalization analysis. On the basis of these results, we developed a novel imaging approach combining immunofluorescence (IF) techniques with in situ PLA to identify the PKCζ·Bcl10 complexes at the level of a specific subcellular compartment, i.e., the nuclear envelope (NE). By this means, we could show that the amount of PKCζ·Bcl10 complexes localized at the NE of C4-I cells during proliferation or after treatment with VP-16 closely corresponded to our previous purely biochemical results. Hence, the present findings demonstrate that the combination of in situ PLA with classical IF detection is a novel powerful analytical tool allowing to morphologically demonstrate new specific protein-protein interactions at level of subcellular organelles, the complexes functions of which can next be clarified through proteomic/biochemical approaches. 	2015	10	13	Histochem Cell Biol	Pacchiana	Raffaella
25087226	10.1016/j.jaci.2014.06.015	The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex: Stepping into the limelight of human primary immunodeficiency.	Next-generation DNA sequencing has accelerated the genetic characterization of many human primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These discoveries can be lifesaving for the affected patients and also provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of specific genes on human immune function. In the past 18 months, a number of independent groups have begun to define novel PIDs caused by defects in the caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11)-B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1 [CBM]) signalosome complex. The CBM complex forms an essential molecular link between the triggering of cell-surface antigen receptors and nuclear factor κB activation. Germline mutations affecting the CBM complex are now recognized as the cause of novel combined immunodeficiency phenotypes, which all share abnormal nuclear factor κB activation and dysregulated B-cell development as defining features. For this ""Current perspectives"" article, we have engaged experts in both basic biology and clinical immunology to capture the worldwide experience in recognizing and managing patients with PIDs caused by CBM complex mutations. 	2014	12	05	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Turvey	Stuart E
25105596	10.1371/journal.pone.0103774	MALT1 auto-proteolysis is essential for NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in activated lymphocytes.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) controls antigen receptor-mediated signalling to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through both its adaptor and protease function. Upon antigen stimulation, MALT1 forms a complex with BCL10 and CARMA1, which is essential for initial IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Parallel induction of MALT1 protease activity serves to inactivate negative regulators of NF-κB signalling, such as A20 and RELB. Here we demonstrate a key role for auto-proteolytic MALT1 cleavage in B- and T-cell receptor signalling. MALT1 cleavage occurred after Arginine 149, between the N-terminal death domain and the first immunoglobulin-like region, and did not affect its proteolytic activity. Jurkat T cells expressing an un-cleavable MALT1-R149A mutant showed unaltered initial IκBα phosphorylation and normal nuclear accumulation of NF-κB subunits. Nevertheless, MALT1 cleavage was required for optimal activation of NF-κB reporter genes and expression of the NF-κB targets IL-2 and CSF2. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that MALT1 cleavage after R149 was required to induce NF-κB transcriptional activity in Jurkat T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that auto-proteolytic MALT1 cleavage controls antigen receptor-induced expression of NF-κB target genes downstream of nuclear NF-κB accumulation. 	2015	04	13	PLoS One	Baens	Mathijs
25150998	10.1007/978-1-4939-1212-4_8	Detection of NF-κB pathway activation in T helper cells.	Upon activation of CD4+ T helper cells the transcription factor complex NF-κB becomes activated and its subunits are able to translocate to the nucleus. There, the dimerized proteins regulate the transcription of for example cytokine and pro-survival genes. This process is of central importance for a proper function of T helper cells as its loss causes severe immunodeficiency, whereas its deregulation can contribute to lymphomagenesis or autoimmunity. In this protocol we describe four methods to investigate NF-κB activation in T helper cells by testing (1) the assembly of the Carma1-Malt1-Bcl10 complex by co-immunoprecipitation, (2) the activation of the IKK complex and the degradation of IκBα by western blot analysis, (3) the degradation of IκBα by intracellular flow cytometry, and (4) the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB by nonradioactive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).	2015	04	16	Methods Mol Biol	Gorka	Oliver
25185127	10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03900	Bcl10 mediates angiotensin II-induced cardiac damage and electrical remodeling.	Angiotensin (Ang) II is a potent mediator of both hypertension and cardiac damage; however, the mechanisms by which this occur remain unclear. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) is a member of the CBM signalosome, which links Ang II and nuclear factor-κB signaling. We hypothesized that Bcl10 is pivotal in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced cardiac damage. Ang II infusion in mice lacking Bcl10 resulted in reduced cardiac fibrosis, less cellular infiltration, and improved arrhythmogenic electric remodeling, despite a similar degree of hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow (BM), whereby Bcl10 knockout or wildtype BM was transferred to their opposite genotype recipients, revealed the dual importance of Bcl10 within both cardiac and immune cells. Loss of Bcl10 in cardiac cells resulted in reduced expression of genes important for the adhesion and recruitment of immune cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that adhesion of monocytes to Ang II-treated endothelial cells also required Bcl10. Additionally, Bcl10 deficiency in macrophages reduced their intrinsic migratory ability. To address the role of BM-derived fibroblasts in the formation of cardiac fibrosis, we explored whether Bcl10 is also important for the infiltration of BM-derived (myo)fibroblasts into the heart. The transfer of green fluorescent protein positive wildtype BM into Bcl10 knockout recipient mice revealed a reduced number of noncardiac (myo)fibroblasts compared with those wildtype recipients. Our results demonstrate the significant role of Bcl10 in multiple cell types important for the generation of Ang II-induced cardiac damage and electric remodeling and may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention. 	2015	01	16	Hypertension	Markó	Lajos

25190756	10.1182/blood-2014-03-564609	Inability to resolve specific infection generates innate immunodeficiency syndrome in Xiap-/- mice.	Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunodeficiency syndromes are linked to mutations in innate receptors and to specific infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type-2 (XLP-2) is associated with deficiency in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), with poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Here we showed that XIAP deficiency selectively impaired B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mediated innate responses to dectin-1 ligands but did not affect responses to various Toll-like receptor agonists. Consequently, Xiap(-/-) mice became highly vulnerable on Candida albicans infection. The compromised early innate responses led to the persistent presence of C albicans and inflammatory cytokines in Xiap(-/-) mice. Furthermore, priming of Xiap(-/-) mice with the dectin-1 ligand curdlan alone resulted in XLP-2-like syndromes. Restoration of dectin-1-induced Rac1 activation and phagocytosis by resolvin D1, but not up-regulation of nuclear factor-κB, rescued Xiap(-/-) mice from C albicans lethal infection. Therefore, development of XLP-2 in XIAP-deficient patients could be partly due to sustained inflammation as a consequence of defective BCL10-dependent innate immunity toward specific pathogens. Importantly, our results suggest the potential therapeutic value of resolvin D1 in the treatment of XLP-2 and innate immunodeficiency syndromes. 	2015	02	27	Blood	Hsieh	Wan-Chen
25202022	10.1074/jbc.M114.588574	C-type lectin receptor dectin-3 mediates trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM)-induced Mincle expression through CARD9/Bcl10/MALT1-dependent nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation.	Previous studies indicate that both Dectin-3 (also called MCL or Clec4d) and Mincle (also called Clec4e), two C-type lectin receptors, can recognize trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM), a cell wall component from mycobacteria, and induce potent innate immune responses. Interestingly, stimulation of Dectin-3 by TDM can also induce Mincle expression, which may enhance the host innate immune system to sense Mycobacterium infection. However, the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression is not fully defined. Here, we show that TDM-induced Mincle expression is dependent on Dectin-3-mediated NF-κB, but not nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), activation, and Dectin-3 induces NF-κB activation through the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex. We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages from Dectin-3-deficient mice were severely defective in the induction of Mincle expression in response to TDM stimulation. This defect is correlated with the failure of TDM-induced NF-κB activation in Dectin-3-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistently, inhibition of NF-κB, but not NFAT, impaired TDM-induced Mincle expression, whereas NF-κB, but not NFAT, binds to the Mincle promoter. Dectin-3-mediated NF-κB activation is dependent on the CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1 complex. Finally, mice deficient for Dectin-3 or CARD9 produced much less proinflammatory cytokines and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific antibodies after immunization with an adjuvant containing TDM. Overall, this study provides the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression in response to Mycobacterium infection, which will have significant impact to improve adjuvant and design vaccine for antimicrobial infection. 	2015	02	12	J Biol Chem	Zhao	Xue-Qiang

The CBM complex constitutes a signaling cluster of more than 1 Mio Dalton. Little is known about factors that facilitate the rapid assembly and maintenance of this dynamic higher order complex. Here, we report the novel interaction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) interacting protein (AIP) and the molecular scaffold protein CARMA1. In T cells, transient binding of CARMA1 and AIP enhanced formation of the CBM complex. Thereby, AIP promoted optimal IKK/NF-κB signaling and IL-2 production in response to TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. Our data demonstrate that AIP acts as a positive regulator of NF-κB signaling upon T cell activation.	2015	04	07	Cell Commun Signal	Schimmack	Gisela
25320244	10.1182/blood-2014-07-589689	Inhibiting CARD11 translation during BCR activation by targeting the eIF4A RNA helicase.	Human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) often aberrantly express oncogenes that generally contain complex secondary structures in their 5' untranslated region (UTR). Oncogenes with complex 5'UTRs require enhanced eIF4A RNA helicase activity for translation. PDCD4 inhibits eIF4A, and PDCD4 knockout mice have a high penetrance for B-cell lymphomas. Here, we show that on B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated p70s6K activation, PDCD4 is degraded, and eIF4A activity is greatly enhanced. We identified a subset of genes involved in BCR signaling, including CARD11, BCL10, and MALT1, that have complex 5'UTRs and encode proteins with short half-lives. Expression of these known oncogenic proteins is enhanced on BCR activation and is attenuated by the eIF4A inhibitor Silvestrol. Antigen-experienced immunoglobulin (Ig)G(+) splenic B cells, from which most DLBCLs are derived, have higher levels of eIF4A cap-binding activity and protein translation than IgM(+) B cells. Our results suggest that eIF4A-mediated enhancement of oncogene translation may be a critical component for lymphoma progression, and specific targeting of eIF4A may be an attractive therapeutic approach in the management of human B-cell lymphomas. 	2015	02	20	Blood	Steinhardt	James J
25365219	10.1172/JCI77493	Inherited BCL10 deficiency impairs hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity.	Heterotrimers composed of B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1), and caspase recruitment domain-containing (CARD) family adaptors play a role in NF-κB activation and have been shown to be involved in both the innate and the adaptive arms of immunity in murine models. Moreover, individuals with inherited defects of MALT1, CARD9, and CARD11 present with immunological and clinical phenotypes. Here, we characterized a case of autosomal-recessive, complete BCL10 deficiency in a child with a broad immunodeficiency, including defects of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. The patient died at 3 years of age and was homozygous for a loss-of-expression, loss-of-function BCL10 mutation. The effect of BCL10 deficiency was dependent on the signaling pathway, and, for some pathways, the cell type affected. Despite the noted similarities to BCL10 deficiency in mice, including a deficient adaptive immune response, human BCL10 deficiency in this patient resulted in a number of specific features within cell populations. Treatment of the patient's myeloid cells with a variety of pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) elicited a normal response; however, NF-κB-mediated fibroblast functions were dramatically impaired. The results of this study indicate that inherited BCL10 deficiency should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency with B cell, T cell, and fibroblast defects. 	2015	07	08	J Clin Invest	Torres	Juan Manuel
25384343	10.1186/s40001-014-0062-8	Characteristics of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-A20-NF-κB expression in T cell-acute lymphocytic leukemia.	Knowledge of the oncogenic signaling pathways of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains limited. Constitutive aberrant activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway has been detected in various lymphoid malignancies and plays a key role in the development of these carcinomas. The zinc finger-containing protein, A20, is a central regulator of multiple NF-κB-activating signaling cascades. A20 is frequently inactivated by deletions and/or mutations in several B-and T-cell lymphoma subtypes. However, few A20 mutations and polymorphisms have been reported in T-ALL. Thus, it is of interest to analyze the expression characteristics of A20 and its regulating factors, including upstream regulators and the CBM complex, which includes CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1. The expression levels of CARMA1, BCL10, MALT1, A20, and NF-κB were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 21 patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL using real-time PCR, and correlations between the aberrant expression of these genes in T-ALL was analyzed. Sixteen healthy individuals, including 10 males and 6 females, served as controls. Significantly lower A20 expression was found in T-ALL patients (median: 4.853) compared with healthy individuals (median: 8.748; P = 0.017), and significantly increased expression levels of CARMA1 (median: 2.916; P = 0.034), BCL10 (median: 0.285; P = 0.033), and MALT1 (median: 1.201; P = 0.010) were found in T-ALL compared with the healthy individuals (median: 1.379, 0.169, and 0.677, respectively). In contrast, overexpression of NF-κB (median: 0.714) was found in T-ALL compared with healthy individuals (median: 0.335; P = 0.001). A negative correlation between the MALT1 and A20 expression levels and a positive correlation between CARMA1 and BCL10 were found in T-ALL and healthy individuals. However, no negative correlation was found between A20 and NF-κB and the MALT1 and NF-κB expression level in the T-ALL group. We characterized the expression of the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1-A20-NF-κB pathway genes in T-ALL. Overexpression of CARMA-BCL10-MALT in T-ALL may contribute to the constitutive cleavage and inactivation of A20, which enhances NF-κB signaling and may be related to T-ALL pathogenesis.	2015	03	13	Eur J Med Res	Ma	Yu
25536807	10.2298/vsp130813035h	BCL10 aberations and NF-kappa B activation involving p65 are absent or rare in primary gastric MALT lymphoma.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma accounts for 5-17% non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The molecular pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas is not well-established. The aim of this study was to evaluate immunohistochemically determined nuclear coexpression of BCL10 and NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in tumor cells of gastric MALT lymphoma and its impact on the patogenesis and outcome of the disease. Medical records of 35 patients with newly diagnosed gastric MALT lymphoma were analyzed and biopsy specimens were immunostained for BCL10 and NF-kappaB expression (p65 subunit). The median age of 35 patients diagnosed with gastric MALT lymphoma was 63.5 years (male/female = 21/14). Symptoms were present in 23/35 (65.7%) patients with the weight loss as the most common symptom. Gastric MALT lymphomas were usually localized in the stomach corpus and corpus and antrum (45.7% and 31.2%, respectively). H. pylon infection was confirmed in 20 out of 30 (66.7%) patients. Treatment options were as follows: immunochemotherapy in 10 (28.5%) patients, surgery in 9 (25.8%) patients, combined surgery and chemotherapy in 14 (40%) patients and supportive measures in 2 (5.7%) patients. Complete remission was achieved in 13 (37.10/) patients and partial remission in two (5.7%/) patients. Sixteen (45.7%/) patients had disease progression (p &lt; 0.001). Cytoplasmatic expression of BCL10 in tumor cells was detected in 19 (54.3%) specimens. Nuclear expression was detected in no specimen. Cytoplasmic expression of NF-kappaB was present in 22 (65.7%) specimens, but nuclear expression was not detected in any specimens. Nuclear expressions (activation)of NF-kappaB p65 subunit and BCL10 were not detected in specimens of gastric MALT lymphoma. The correlation of nuclear coexpression of BCL10 and NF-kappaB in gastric MALT lymphoma was not established. These results indicate that other mechanisms and signal pathways are active in lymphogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma, as that apoptotic inhibition is not the main, nor the only mechanism in tumorogenesis.	2015	07	16	Vojnosanit Pregl	Hajder	Jelena
23149938	10.1128/MCB.00850-12	A quantitative signaling screen identifies CARD11 mutations in the CARD and LATCH domains that induce Bcl10 ubiquitination and human lymphoma cell survival.	Antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, essential for normal lymphocyte activation, is dysregulated in several types of lymphoma. During normal signaling, the multidomain adapter CARD11 transitions from a closed, inactive state to an open, active scaffold that assembles a multiprotein complex, leading to NF-κB activation. The regulation of CARD11 scaffold function is bypassed by lymphoma-associated oncogenic CARD11 mutations that induce spontaneous signaling. We report an unbiased high-throughput quantitative signaling screen that identifies new CARD11 hyperactive variants and defines a LATCH domain that functions with the CARD to promote CARD11 autoinhibition. Gain-of-function mutations in the LATCH or CARD disrupt inhibitory domain binding, promote Bcl10 association, and induce Bcl10 ubiquitination, NF-κB activation, and human lymphoma cell survival. Our results identify CARD11 mutations with oncogenic potential, provide a mechanistic explanation for their signaling potency, and offer a straightforward method for the discovery of variants that promote the tumorigenesis of NF-κB-dependent lymphomas.	2013	02	21	Mol Cell Biol	Chan	Waipan
23252516	10.1111/bjh.12172	Lenalidomide efficacy in activated B-cell-like subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is dependent upon IRF4 and cereblon expression.	Durable responses with lenalidomide monotherapy have been reported in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), higher responses were observed in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype than in the germinal centre B-cell-like subtype. Herein, the molecular mechanisms involved in the differential efficacy of lenalidomide in DLBCL subtypes were investigated. Using DLBCL cell lines, lenalidomide treatment was found to preferentially suppress proliferation of ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro and delay tumour growth in a human tumour xenograft model, with minimal effect on non-ABC-DLBCL cells. This tumouricidal effect was associated with downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a hallmark of ABC-DLBCL cells. IRF4 inhibition by lenalidomide induced downregulation of B-cell receptor (BCR)-dependent NF-κB. Whereas IRF4-specific small, interfering RNA mimicked the effects of lenalidomide reducing NF-κB activation, IRF4 overexpression enhanced NF-κB activation and conferred resistance to lenalidomide. These findings indicate the crucial role of IRF4 inhibition in lenalidomide efficacy in ABC cells. Furthermore, lenalidomide-induced IRF4 downregulation required the expression of cereblon, a molecular target of lenalidomide. Taken together, these findings suggest that lenalidomide has direct antitumour activity against DLBCL cells, preferentially ABC-DLBCL cells, by blocking IRF4 expression and the BCR-NF-κB signalling pathway in a cereblon-dependent manner.	2013	06	17	Br J Haematol	Zhang	Ling-Hua
23297344	10.1128/MCB.06407-11	Kinase-independent feedback of the TAK1/TAB1 complex on BCL10 turnover and NF-κB activation.	Antigen receptors activate pathways that control cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Two important targets of antigen receptors, NF-κB and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), are activated downstream of CARMA1, a scaffolding protein that nucleates a complex including BCL10, MALT1, and other IκB kinase (IKK)-signalosome components. Somatic mutations that constitutively activate CARMA1 occur frequently in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mediate essential survival signals. Mechanisms that downregulate this pathway might thus yield important therapeutic targets. Stimulation of antigen receptors induces not only BCL10 activation but also its degradation downstream of CARMA1, thereby ultimately limiting signals to its downstream targets. Here, using lymphocyte cell models, we identify a kinase-independent requirement for TAK1 and its adaptor, TAB1, in antigen receptor-induced BCL10 degradation. We show that TAK1 acts as an adaptor for E3 ubiquitin ligases that target BCL10 for degradation. Functionally, TAK1 overexpression restrains CARMA1-dependent activation of NF-κB by reducing BCL10 levels. TAK1 also promotes counterselection of NF-κB-addicted DLBCL lines by a dual mechanism involving kinase-independent degradation of BCL10 and kinase-dependent activation of JNK. Thus, by directly promoting BCL10 degradation, TAK1 counterbalances NF-κB and JNK signals essential for the activation and survival of lymphocytes and CARMA1-addicted lymphoma types.	2013	07	05	Mol Cell Biol	Moreno-García	Miguel E
23393199	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2362	Hyperactivated JNK is a therapeutic target in pVHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma.	Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), the major histologic subtype of RCC accounting for more than 80% of cases, are typified by biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Although accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-α) is the most well-studied effect of VHL inactivation, direct inhibition of HIFα or restoration of wild-type pVHL protein expression has not proved readily feasible, given the limitations associated with pharmacologic targeting of transcription factors (i.e., HIF-α) and gene replacement therapy of tumor suppressor genes (i.e., VHL). Here, we have established that phosphorylated c-Jun, a substrate of the c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase (JNK), is selectively activated in clear cell RCC patient specimens. Using multiple isogenic cell lines, we show that HIF-α-independent JNK hyperactivation is unique to the pVHL-deficient state. Importantly, pVHL-deficient RCCs are dependent upon JNK activity for in vitro and in vivo growth. A multistep signaling pathway that links pVHL loss to JNK activation involves the formation of a CARD9/BCL10/TRAF6 complex as a proximal signal to sequentially stimulate TAK1 (MAPKKK), MKK4 (MAPKK), and JNK (MAPK). JNK stimulates c-Jun phosphorylation, activation, and dimerization with c-Fos to form a transcriptionally competent AP1 complex that drives transcription of the Twist gene and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, JNK represents a novel molecular target that is selectively activated in and drives the growth of pVHL-deficient clear cell RCCs. These findings can serve as the preclinical foundation for directed efforts to characterize potent pharmacologic inhibitors of the JNK pathway for clinical translation.	2013	04	15	Cancer Res	An	Jiabin
23463379	10.1002/ijc.28148	Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II contributes to inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B kinase complex activation in Helicobacter pylori infection.	Helicobacter pylori, a class I carcinogen, induces a proinflammatory response by activating the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in gastric epithelial cells. This inflammatory condition could lead to chronic gastritis, which is epidemiologically and biologically linked to the development of gastric cancer. So far, there exists no clear knowledge on how H. pylori induces the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. In our study, we investigated the role of Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII), calmodulin, protein kinases C (PKCs) and the CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex in conjunction with H. pylori-induced activation of NF-κB via the inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B kinase (IKK) complex. We use specific inhibitors and/or RNA interference to assess the contribution of these components. Our results show that CAMKII and calmodulin contribute to IKK complex activation and thus to the induction of NF-κB in response to H. pylori infection, but not in response to TNF-α. Thus, our findings are specific for H. pylori infected cells. Neither the PKCs α, δ, θ, nor the CBM complex itself is involved in the activation of NF-κB by H. pylori. The contribution of CAMKII and calmodulin, but not PKCs/CBM to the induction of an inflammatory response by H. pylori infection augment the understanding of the molecular mechanism involved and provide potential new disease markers for the diagnosis of gastric inflammatory diseases including gastric cancer.	2013	09	12	Int J Cancer	Maubach	Gunter
23525237	10.3892/ijmm.2013.1307	Self-oligomerization of the CARD domain prevents complex formation in the CARMA1 signalosome.	The CARMA1 signalosome composed of CARMA1, BCL10 and MALT1 plays a pivotal role in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation via the NF-κB pathway. For assembly of the CARMA1 signalosome, BCL10 functions as an adaptor protein that interacts with CARMA1 via the CARD-CARD interaction and with MALT1 via interaction between the C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich region of BCL10 and the first Ig domain of MALT1. Despite the biological importance of the CARMA1 signalosome, structural and biochemical studies have been limited as CARD-containing proteins are prone to aggregation under physiological conditions. In the present study, we successfully purified and characterized CARMA1 CARD and BCL10 CARD and showed that both CARMA1 CARD and BCL10 CARD easily self-oligomerized under physiological conditions. This self-oligomerization of the CARD domain prevents complex formation in the CARMA1 signalosome in vitro. Finally, we propose an interaction mode between CARMA1 CARD and BCL10 CARD based on a structure-based modeling study.	2013	10	29	Int J Mol Med	Park	Jin Hee
23530562	10.1111/pin.12045	BCL10 as a useful marker for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, especially using endoscopic ultrasound cytology specimens.	Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) of the pancreas are characterized by the histological and immunohistochemical features of acinar cell differentiation. Recently, BCL10, originally identified as a recurrent t(1;14)(p22;q32) translocation in MALT B-cell lymphoma, was found to be immunohistochemically positive in some solid tumors, including ACC. To evaluate its diagnostic efficacy, we performed BCL10 immunohistochemistry and evaluated molecular markers correlated to pancreatic tumor lineages (neuroendocrine markers and a mutation analysis of KRAS and GNAS) using samples from 126 pancreatic tumors (17 ACCs, 24 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, 4 adenosquamous carcinomas, 9 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 10 mucinous cystic neoplasms, 44 neuroendocrine tumors, 9 serous cystic tumors and 10 solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms). BCL10 was exclusively expressed in normal acini. In pancreatic tumors, 14 of 17 (82%) ACCs and 2 of 4 (50%) adenosquamous carcinomas were positive, while the other subtypes were almost negative. We subsequently examined the diagnostic utility of BCL10 in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) specimens using 57 pancreatic tumors. BLC10 correctly identified ACCs (9/13) and adenosquamous carcinomas (2/4) but none of the other subtypes (n = 41). Therefore, we suggested that BCL10 expression is a useful marker for acinar cell differentiation, particularly in the diagnosis of EUS-FNA specimens.	2013	09	24	Pathol Int	Hosoda	Waki
23545653	10.1107/S1744309113005642	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of the CARD domain of human CARMA1.	The CARMA1 signalosome, which is composed of CARMA1 [caspase recruitment domain (CARD) containing MAGUK protein 1], BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma 10) and MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), is a molecular-signalling complex that performs pivotal functions in T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated NF-κB activation. In this study, the CARD domain of human CARMA1 (CARMA1 CARD), corresponding to amino acids 14-109, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using an engineered C-terminal His tag. CARMA1 CARD was then purified to homogeneity and crystallized at 293 K. Finally, X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 3.2 Å from a crystal belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit-cell parameters a = 45.73, b = 53.37, c = 91.89 Å.	2013	12	18	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Park	Jin Hee
23616440	10.1002/glia.22502	Amyloid beta deregulates astroglial mGluR5-mediated calcium signaling via calcineurin and Nf-kB.	The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that soluble amyloid β (Aβ) is an initiator of a cascade of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Recently, we reported that Aβ deranged Ca(2+) homeostasis specifically in hippocampal astrocytes by targeting key elements of Ca(2+) signaling, such as mGluR5 and IP3 R1. In the present study, we dissect a cascade of signaling events by which Aβ deregulates glial Ca(2+) : (i) 100 nM Aβ leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium after 4-6 h of treatment; (ii) mGluR5 is increased after 24 h of treatment; (iii) this increase is blocked by inhibitors of calcineurin (CaN) and NF-kB. Furthermore, we show that Aβ treatment of glial cells leads to de-phosphorylation of Bcl10 and an increased CaN-Bcl10 interaction. Last, mGluR5 staining is augmented in hippocampal astrocytes of AD patients in proximity of Aβ plaques and co-localizes with nuclear accumulation of the p65 NF-kB subunit and increased staining of CaNAα. Taken together our data suggest that nanomolar [Aβ] deregulates Ca(2+) homeostasis via CaN and its downstream target NF-kB, possibly via the cross-talk of Bcl10 in hippocampal astrocytes.	2014	02	10	Glia	Lim	Dmitry
23632891	10.1182/blood-2012-12-470153	Trimeric G protein-CARMA1 axis links smoothened, the hedgehog receptor transducer, to NF-κB activation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways is ubiquitously observed and known to mediate tumor growth, survival, and chemoresistance in DLBCL. Here, we find that activation of Hh signaling is positively correlated with NF-κB pathway in DLBCL tumors, and that smoothened (SMO), the signal transducer subunit of Hh pathway, contributes to NF-κB activation through recruiting G protein subunits Gαi and Gα12 to activate PKCβ/CARMA1/TRAF6/NEMO signaling axis followed by assembling of the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1/TRAF6 complex to SMO. Moreover, functional inhibition of SMO enhances the cytotoxic effects of NF-κB inhibitor. Altogether, our study reveals a noncanonical Hh signaling pathway in which SMO activates trimeric G proteins and CARMA1-associated signaling complex, leading to NF-κB activation. This signaling cascade contributes to the survival of DLBCL and may serve as a potential target for combination therapies in DLBCL.	2013	08	06	Blood	Qu	Changju
23661444	10.4238/2013.April.12.6	Significance of Bcl10 gene mutations in the clinical diagnosis of MALT-type ocular adnexal lymphoma in the Chinese population.	We investigated the expression of Bcl10 gene mutations in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL), atypical lymphoid hyperplasia (ALH), and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) in the Chinese population and its role in clinical diagnosis and pathogenesis. Forty-three samples were collected during patient surgeries. Pathological diagnosis confirmed OAL in 23 cases, ALH in 10 cases, and RLH in 10 cases. Normal peripheral lymph tissues from 12 cases were used as negative controls. Bcl10 gene expression was examined using molecular biological methods, and DNA sequences and mutations were compared with published data. The protein expression of Bcl10 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) were detected with immunohistological and immunofluorescence colocalization. Bcl10 gene expression was detected in 15 OAL cases. Novel mutations were found in 11 cases. Notably, 1 mutation, which matched a published mutation, was detected in 1 ALH case; 1 novel mutation was found in 1 RLH case; and no Bcl10 gene mutation was found in controls. Most novel mutations were truncation mutations, resulting in a truncated protein product of 99 amino acids (compared to the full-length 233 amino acids; GenBank accession No. EF189176). Results of tests for abnormal Bcl10 gene expression in nuclei or cytoplasm were consistent with changes in NF-κB translocation. This report is the first of newly discovered mutations in the Bcl10 gene in the Chinese population. The distribution of the mutations is consistent with and more sensitive than that of the pathological diagnosis. These mutations can be used to identify the stage and clinical characteristics even when morphological changes are absent.	2013	10	22	Genet Mol Res	Zhu	J
23677497	10.1007/s13105-013-0259-2	Bcl10 is an essential regulator for A20 gene expression.	A20, a tumor suppressor in several types of lymphomas, has been suggested to be an nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) target gene; conversely, the deubiquitylation activity of A20 is required for inhibition of Bcl10-mediated activation of NF-κB. BCL10, which is activated in a recurrent chromosomal translocation that causes human mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, is known to be essential for NF-κB activation in B cells. We report here that Bcl10 upregulates endogenous A20 gene expression in B lymphocytes upon B-cell receptor engagement of anti-IgM. Transient transfection assays in HEK 293 cells indicate that Bcl10 can activate the A20 promoter, which contains NF-κB-binding sites. We also construct a theoretical structure of mouse Bcl10 and analyze the structure by molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. Lastly, we found that marginal zone B cells from BCL10-transgenic mice proliferate more readily than wild-type B cells, whereas, surprisingly, the transgenic follicular B cells from these mice proliferate comparably to wild-type cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Bcl10 is an essential regulator of A20 gene expression and B-cell proliferation mediated by B-cell receptor signaling. 	2014	07	17	J Physiol Biochem	Xu	Wu
23690623	10.1073/pnas.1221925110	Regulation of T cell function by the ubiquitin-specific protease USP9X via modulating the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex.	The ubiquitin conjugation system plays an important role in immune regulation; however, the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) that carry out deubiquitination of cellular substrates are poorly understood. Here we show that in vivo knockdown of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X attenuates T-cell proliferation. In addition, naïve CD4(+) T cells from USP9X knockdown chimeric mice display decreased cytokine production and T helper cell differentiation in vitro, which we confirmed in vivo by performing adoptive transfer of transgenic T cells and subsequent immunization. USP9X silencing in both a human T-cell line and mouse primary T cells reduced T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling-induced NF-κB activation. Mechanistically, USP9X interacts with Bcl10 of the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex and removes the TCR-induced ubiquitin chain from Bcl10, which facilitates the association of Carma1 with Bcl0-Malt1. These results demonstrate that USP9X is a crucial positive regulator of the TCR signaling pathway and is required for T-cell function through the modulation of CBM complex formation.	2013	08	06	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Park	Yoon
23766559	10.1155/2013/397642	Carrageenan-induced colonic inflammation is reduced in Bcl10 null mice and increased in IL-10-deficient mice.	The common food additive carrageenan is a known activator of inflammation in mammalian tissues and stimulates both the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation. Exposure to low concentrations of carrageenan (10 μ g/mL in the water supply) has produced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin signaling in C57BL/6 mice. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) is a mediator of inflammatory signals from Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in myeloid and epithelial cells. Since the TLR4 signaling pathway is activated in diabetes and by carrageenan, we addressed systemic and intestinal inflammatory responses following carrageenan exposure in Bcl10 wild type, heterozygous, and null mice. Fecal calprotectin and circulating keratinocyte chemokine (KC), nuclear RelA and RelB, phospho(Thr559)-NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), and phospho(Ser36)-IκBα in the colonic epithelial cells were significantly less (P &lt; 0.001) in the carrageenan-treated Bcl10 null mice than in controls. IL-10-deficient mice exposed to carrageenan in a germ-free environment showed an increase in activation of the canonical pathway of NF-κB (RelA) activation, but without increase in RelB or phospho-Bcl10, and exogenous IL-10 inhibited only the canonical pathway of NF- κ B activation in cultured colonic cells. These findings demonstrate a Bcl10 requirement for maximum development of carrageenan-induced inflammation and lack of complete suppression by IL-10 of carrageenan-induced inflammation.	2013	12	03	Mediators Inflamm	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
23770291	10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.06.007	Antagonistic crosstalk between NF-κB and SIRT1 in the regulation of inflammation and metabolic disorders.	Recent studies have indicated that the regulation of innate immunity and energy metabolism are connected together through an antagonistic crosstalk between NF-κB and SIRT1 signaling pathways. NF-κB signaling has a major role in innate immunity defense while SIRT1 regulates the oxidative respiration and cellular survival. However, NF-κB signaling can stimulate glycolytic energy flux during acute inflammation, whereas SIRT1 activation inhibits NF-κB signaling and enhances oxidative metabolism and the resolution of inflammation. SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB signaling directly by deacetylating the p65 subunit of NF-κB complex. SIRT1 stimulates oxidative energy production via the activation of AMPK, PPARα and PGC-1α and simultaneously, these factors inhibit NF-κB signaling and suppress inflammation. On the other hand, NF-κB signaling down-regulates SIRT1 activity through the expression of miR-34a, IFNγ, and reactive oxygen species. The inhibition of SIRT1 disrupts oxidative energy metabolism and stimulates the NF-κB-induced inflammatory responses present in many chronic metabolic and age-related diseases. We will examine the molecular mechanisms of the antagonistic signaling between NF-κB and SIRT1 and describe how this crosstalk controls inflammatory process and energy metabolism. In addition, we will discuss how disturbances in this signaling crosstalk induce the appearance of chronic inflammation in metabolic diseases. 	2014	03	03	Cell Signal	Kauppinen	Anu
23784377	10.1093/hmg/ddt286	An association study of TOLL and CARD with leprosy susceptibility in Chinese population.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified multiple susceptibility loci that have highlighted the important role of TLR (Toll-like receptor) and CARD (caspase recruitment domain) genes in leprosy. A large three-stage candidate gene-based association study of 30 TLR and 47 CARD genes was performed in the leprosy samples of Chinese Han. Of 4363 SNPs investigated, eight SNPs showed suggestive association (P &lt; 0.01) in our previously published GWAS datasets (Stage 1). Of the eight SNPs, rs2735591 and rs4889841 showed significant association (P &lt; 0.001) in an independent series of 1504 cases and 1502 controls (Stage 2), but only rs2735591 (next to BCL10) showed significant association in the second independent series of 938 cases and 5827 controls (Stage 3). Rs2735591 showed consistent association across the three stages (P &gt; 0.05 for heterogeneity test), significant association in the combined validation samples (Pcorrected = 5.54 × 10(-4) after correction for 4363 SNPs tested) and genome-wide significance in the whole GWAS and validation samples (P = 1.03 × 10(-9), OR = 1.24). In addition, we demonstrated the lower expression of BCL10 in leprosy lesions than normal skins and a significant gene connection between BCL10 and the eight previously identified leprosy loci that are associated with NFκB, a major regulator of downstream inflammatory responses, which provides further biological evidence for the association. We have discovered a novel susceptibility locus on 1p22, which implicates BCL10 as a new susceptibility gene for leprosy. Our finding highlights the important role of both innate and adaptive immune responses in leprosy. 	2014	04	30	Hum Mol Genet	Liu	Hong
23827971	10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.06.002	Impaired autophagy and APP processing in Alzheimer's disease: The potential role of Beclin 1 interactome.	The accumulation of amyloid-β-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-β peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-β. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. 	2014	03	27	Prog Neurobiol	Salminen	Antero
23918355	10.1073/pnas.1303669110	Inhibition of pluripotent stem cell-derived teratoma formation by small molecules.	The future of safe cell-based therapy rests on overcoming teratoma/tumor formation, in particular when using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Because the presence of a few remaining undifferentiated hPSCs can cause undesirable teratomas after transplantation, complete removal of these cells with no/minimal damage to differentiated cells is a prerequisite for clinical application of hPSC-based therapy. Having identified a unique hESC signature of pro- and antiapoptotic gene expression profile, we hypothesized that targeting hPSC-specific antiapoptotic factor(s) (i.e., survivin or Bcl10) represents an efficient strategy to selectively eliminate pluripotent cells with teratoma potential. Here we report the successful identification of small molecules that can effectively inhibit these antiapoptotic factors, leading to selective and efficient removal of pluripotent stem cells through apoptotic cell death. In particular, a single treatment of hESC-derived mixed population with chemical inhibitors of survivin (e.g., quercetin or YM155) induced selective and complete cell death of undifferentiated hPSCs. In contrast, differentiated cell types (e.g., dopamine neurons and smooth-muscle cells) derived from hPSCs survived well and maintained their functionality. We found that quercetin-induced selective cell death is caused by mitochondrial accumulation of p53 and is sufficient to prevent teratoma formation after transplantation of hESC- or hiPSC-derived cells. Taken together, these results provide the ""proof of concept"" that small-molecule targeting of hPSC-specific antiapoptotic pathway(s) is a viable strategy to prevent tumor formation by selectively eliminating remaining undifferentiated pluripotent cells for safe hPSC-based therapy. 	2013	11	22	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Lee	Mi-Ok
24004675	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3869	Molecular pathways: targeting MALT1 paracaspase activity in lymphoma.	MALT1 mediates the activation of NF-κB in response to antigen receptor signaling. MALT1, in association with BCL10 and CARD11, functions as a scaffolding protein to activate the inhibitor of IκB kinase (IKK) complex. In addition, MALT1 is a paracaspase that targets key proteins in a feedback loop mediating termination of the NF-κB response, thus promoting activation of NF-κB signaling. Activated B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCL), which tend to be more resistant to chemotherapy, are often biologically dependent on MALT1 activity. Newly developed MALT1 small-molecule inhibitors suppress the growth of ABC-DLBCLs in vitro and in vivo. This review highlights the recent advances in the normal and disease-related functions of MALT1. Furthermore, recent progress targeting MALT1 proteolytic activity raises the possibility of deploying MALT1 inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and perhaps autoimmune diseases that involve increased B- or T-cell receptor signaling.	2014	08	26	Clin Cancer Res	Fontán	Lorena
24036998	10.1038/ni.2708	Signaling by Fyn-ADAP via the Carma1-Bcl-10-MAP3K7 signalosome exclusively regulates inflammatory cytokine production in NK cells.	Inflammation is a critical component of the immune response. However, acute or chronic inflammation can be highly destructive. Uncontrolled inflammation forms the basis for allergy, asthma and various autoimmune disorders. Here we identified a signaling pathway that was exclusively responsible for the production of inflammatory cytokines but not for cytotoxicity. Recognition of tumor cells expressing the NK cell-activatory ligands H60 or CD137L by mouse natural killer (NK) cells led to efficient cytotoxicity and the production of inflammatory cytokines. Both of those effector functions required the kinases Lck, Fyn and PI(3)K (subunits p85α and p110δ) and the signaling protein PLC-γ2. However, a complex of Fyn and the adaptor ADAP exclusively regulated the production of inflammatory cytokines but not cytotoxicity in NK cells. That unique function of ADAP required a Carma1-Bcl-10-MAP3K7 signaling axis. Our results have identified molecules that can be targeted to regulate inflammation without compromising NK cell cytotoxicity. 	2013	12	13	Nat Immunol	Rajasekaran	Kamalakannan
24074955	10.1016/j.molcel.2013.08.032	Structural architecture of the CARMA1/Bcl10/MALT1 signalosome: nucleation-induced filamentous assembly.	The CARMA1/Bcl10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome mediates antigen receptor-induced NF-κB signaling to regulate multiple lymphocyte functions. While CARMA1 and Bcl10 contain caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), MALT1 is a paracaspase with structural similarity to caspases. Here we show that the reconstituted CBM signalosome is a helical filamentous assembly in which substoichiometric CARMA1 nucleates Bcl10 filaments. Bcl10 filament formation is a highly cooperative process whose threshold is sensitized by oligomerized CARMA1 upon receptor activation. In cells, both cotransfected CARMA1/Bcl10 complex and the endogenous CBM signalosome are filamentous morphologically. Combining crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy, we reveal the structure of the Bcl10 CARD filament and the mode of interaction between CARMA1 and Bcl10. Structure-guided mutagenesis confirmed the observed interfaces in Bcl10 filament assembly and MALT1 activation in vitro and NF-κB activation in cells. These data support a paradigm of nucleation-induced signal transduction with threshold response due to cooperativity and signal amplification by polymerization.	2013	12	09	Mol Cell	Qiao	Qi

21954216	10.1002/pbc.23331	Inhibition of caspase-8 activity caused by overexpression of BCL10 contributes to the pathogenesis of high-grade MALT lymphoma.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma comprises approximately 8% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is the most common lymphoma in the gastro-intestinal tract. It is caused by genetic abnormalities or bacterial infections/chronic inflammation. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) overexpression and nuclear expression have been associated with high-grade MALT lymphomas with genetic abnormalities that are unresponsive to Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. To explore the molecular mechanism of BCL10 overexpression on the pathogenesis and malignant phenotype of MALT lymphoma, we generated EµSR-BCL10 transgenic mice. By generation of heterozygous and homozygous EuSR-BCL10 mice and showing BCL10 expression levels in these mice, we quantitatively examined relation of MZ B cell expansion and inhibition of caspase-8 activity with BCL10 protein level. We also investigated API2 and caspase-8 expression by Western blot and their interaction with BCL10 by co-immunoprecipitation. MZ B-cell expansion is directly related to BCL10 protein level in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of caspases-8 and -3, but not caspase-9, was inhibited with increasing of BCL10 protein level. Expanded MZ B cells showed selective survival under stimulation of anti-immunoglobulin M, but not dexamethasone, γ-irradiation, or anti-CD95, implying that overexpressed BCL10 exerts anti-apoptotic effects through B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) pathway. Overexpressed BCL10 protein co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-8 and API2 protein, suggesting an in vivo interaction of them. Our data demonstrate a novel effect of overexpressed BCL10 in the pathogenesis of high-grade MALT lymphoma by increasing expression of API2 and it then forming a protein complex with BCL10/caspase-8 leading to caspase-8 activity suppression.	2012	05	16	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Chen	Yan
21988643	10.3109/10428194.2011.631157	Molecular pathogenesis and histologic and clinical features of extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type (EMZL) is considered an antigen driven lymphoid malignancy associated with protracted antigenic stimulation by microbial pathogens, auto-antigens or other unknown stimuli, which trigger a sustained lymphoid proliferation at sites normally devoid of lymphoid tissue. With the progression of disease, chromosomal aberrations may occur. They result in aberrant activation of signaling pathways which lead to the lymphoproliferation becoming independent of antigenic stimulation. The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway plays a central role in the lymphomagenesis of EMZL. Four mutually exclusive chromosomal translocations have been identified that lead to the up-regulation of either BCL10 or MALT1 or the generation of a fusion protein, cIAP2-MALT1, and induce aberrant activation of the NF-κB pathway. In translocation-negative EMZL, inactivation of the global NF-κB inhibitor A20 might play an important role. These genetic abnormalities alone are insufficient for malignant transformation. Other factors, such as cell surface and chemokine receptors and factors involved with immune and inflammatory response, play their own unique role in the development of a malignant EMZL and may determine its unique clinico-pathological presentation. This review provides an overview of the histologic and clinical features of EMZL and discusses the current insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of EMZL.	2012	10	09	Leuk Lymphoma	Kuper-Hommel	Marion J J
22079206	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.05.012	Molecular signature of kappa-carrageenan mimics chondroitin-4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate and enables interaction with arylsulfatase B.	The common food additive kappa-carrageenan (κ-CGN) is a sulfated polysaccharide that resembles chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate (DS). All have a sulfate group on C4 of a glycoside (galactose for CGN and N-acetylgalactosamine for C4S), and the sulfate-bearing glycoside is linked in a β-1,4-configuration to an unsulfated, six-carbon sugar (galactose for CGN, glucuronate for C4S and iduronate for DS). The enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate) is the highly selective enzyme that removes the four-sulfate group from the nonreducing terminus of C4S and DS, thereby regulating subsequent degradation. In this report, κ-CGN is shown to be a substrate for recombinant human ARSB (rhARSB). Sulfate was generated from both C4S and κ-CGN following incubation with rhARSB. Exposure of human colonic epithelial cells to κ-CGN, but not to C4S, produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. The ROS production from κ-CGN was reduced by exposure to rhARSB, but increased by competition from C4S or DS, but not from chondroitin-6-sulfate. Prior treatment of either lambda- or iota-CGN with rhARSB had no impact on ROS, IL-8 or inorganic sulfate production, demonstrating a specific effect of the molecular configuration of κ-CGN. By mimicry of C4S and DS and by interaction with ARSB, κ-CGN can directly interfere with the normal cellular functions of C4S, DS and ARSB. Since C4S and DS are present in high concentration in tissues, the impact of κ-CGN exposure may be due to some extent to interference with the normal biological functions of ARSB, C4S and DS.	2013	01	24	J Nutr Biochem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
22323537	10.4049/jimmunol.1101502	Cutting edge: the ""death"" adaptor CRADD/RAIDD targets BCL10 and suppresses agonist-induced cytokine expression in T lymphocytes.	The expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to TCR agonists is regulated by the caspase-recruitment domain membrane-associated guanylate kinase 1 (CARMA1) signalosome through the coordinated assembly of complexes containing the BCL10 adaptor protein. We describe a novel mechanism to negatively regulate the CARMA1 signalosome by the ""death"" adaptor protein caspase and receptor interacting protein adaptor with death domain (CRADD)/receptor interacting protein-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain. We show that CRADD interacts with BCL10 through its caspase recruitment domain and suppresses interactions between BCL10 and CARMA1. TCR agonist-induced interaction between CRADD and BCL10 coincides with reduction of its complex formation with CARMA1 in wild-type, as compared with Cradd-deficient, primary cells. Finally, Cradd-deficient spleen cells, CD4(+) T cells, and mice respond to T cell agonists with strikingly higher production of proinflammatory mediators, including IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-17. These results define a novel role for CRADD as a negative regulator of the CARMA1 signalosome and suppressor of Th1- and Th17-mediated inflammatory responses.	2012	04	19	J Immunol	Lin	Qing
22363141	10.3748/wjg.v18.i7.685	Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and Helicobacter pylori infection: a Colombian perspective.	To assess the significance of chromosome translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21), B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL-10) protein and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in Colombia. Fifty cases of gastric MALT lymphoma and their respective post-treatment follow-up biopsies were examined to assess the presence of the translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) as identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization; to detect protein expression patterns of BCL10 using immunohistochemistry; and for evaluation of tumor histology to determine the correlation of these factors and resistance to H. pylori eradication. Infection with H. pylori was confirmed in all cases of gastric MALT lymphoma in association with chronic gastritis. Bacterial eradication led to tumor regression in 66% of cases. The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) was not present in any of these cases, nor was there evidence of tumor transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thirty-four percent of the patients showed resistance to tumor regression, and within this group, 7 cases, representing 14% of all those analyzed, were considered to be t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive gastric MALT lymphomas. Protein expression of BCL10 in the nucleus was associated with the presence of translocation and treatment resistance. Cases that were considered unresponsive to therapy were histologically characterized by the presence of homogeneous tumor cells and a lack of plasmacytic differentiation. Responder cases exhibited higher cellular heterogeneity and a greater frequency of plasma cells. Both t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphoma cases and those with nuclear BCL10 expression are considered resistant to H. pylori eradication. It is suggested that chronic antigenic stimulation is not a dominant event in resistant cases.	2012	04	11	World J Gastroenterol	Yepes	Sally
22366302	10.1016/j.jmb.2012.02.018	Structural determinants of MALT1 protease activity.	The formation of the CBM (CARD11-BCL10-MALT1) complex is pivotal for antigen-receptor-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Signaling is dependent on MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), which not only acts as a scaffolding protein but also possesses proteolytic activity mediated by its caspase-like domain. It remained unclear how the CBM activates MALT1. Here, we provide biochemical and structural evidence that MALT1 activation is dependent on its dimerization and show that mutations at the dimer interface abrogate activity in cells. The unliganded protease presents itself in a dimeric yet inactive state and undergoes substantial conformational changes upon substrate binding. These structural changes also affect the conformation of the C-terminal Ig-like domain, a domain that is required for MALT1 activity. Binding to the active site is coupled to a relative movement of caspase and Ig-like domains. MALT1 binding partners thus may have the potential of tuning MALT1 protease activity without binding directly to the caspase domain.	2012	07	10	J Mol Biol	Wiesmann	Christian
22382892	10.1038/leu.2012.28	Chlamydia psittaci-negative ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas have biased VH4-34 immunoglobulin gene expression and proliferate in a distinct inflammatory environment.	Ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (OAMZLs) arise in the connective tissues of the orbit or in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the conjunctiva. Here, we present the immunological and genetic analyses of 20 primary Chlamydia psittaci (Cp)-negative OAMZLs. Analysis of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene usage demonstrated a significant preference for V(H)4-34. A combined analysis across all previously published OAMZLs confirmed that this is a general feature of OAMZL, in particular of the Cp-negative group. Our series of OAMZLs did not express the characteristic rheumatoid factor V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements that were previously found in salivary gland- and gastric-marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCLs). We did not detect the MZBCL-specific chromosomal translocations, t(11;18) API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue1) and t(14;18) IgH/MALT1. Two cases contained a premature stop codon in the A20 gene (TNFAIP3) and one case harbored the activating MYD88 hotspot mutation L265P. Variable nuclear expression of BCL10, NFκB1 (p50) and NFκB2 (p52) suggests that other additional genetic abnormalities affecting the NFκB pathway exist within this group of lymphomas. OAMZL showed variable expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and integrin α4β7 by the tumor B cells, and low interferon-γ and interlukin-4 mRNA levels in the tissue, indicative of an inflammatory environment with features in between those previously found in cutaneous and other extranodal MZBCL. The strongly biased usage of V(H)4-34 in Cp-negative OAMZLs suggests involvement of a particular stimulatory (auto-) antigen in their development.	2012	10	09	Leukemia	van Maldegem	F
22407319	10.1038/nature10894	The Shigella flexneri effector OspI deamidates UBC13 to dampen the inflammatory response.	Many bacterial pathogens can enter various host cells and then survive intracellularly, transiently evade humoral immunity, and further disseminate to other cells and tissues. When bacteria enter host cells and replicate intracellularly, the host cells sense the invading bacteria as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by way of various pattern recognition receptors. As a result, the host cells induce alarm signals that activate the innate immune system. Therefore, bacteria must modulate host inflammatory signalling and dampen these alarm signals. How pathogens do this after invading epithelial cells remains unclear, however. Here we show that OspI, a Shigella flexneri effector encoded by ORF169b on the large plasmid and delivered by the type ΙΙΙ secretion system, dampens acute inflammatory responses during bacterial invasion by suppressing the tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated signalling pathway. OspI is a glutamine deamidase that selectively deamidates the glutamine residue at position 100 in UBC13 to a glutamic acid residue. Consequently, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity required for TRAF6 activation is inhibited, allowing S. flexneri OspI to modulate the diacylglycerol-CBM (CARD-BCL10-MALT1) complex-TRAF6-nuclear-factor-κB signalling pathway. We determined the 2.0 Å crystal structure of OspI, which contains a putative cysteine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad. A mutational analysis showed this catalytic triad to be essential for the deamidation of UBC13. Our results suggest that S. flexneri inhibits acute inflammatory responses in the initial stage of infection by targeting the UBC13-TRAF6 complex.	2012	05	08	Nature	Sanada	Takahito
22423967	10.1016/j.chom.2012.01.019	The autophagy regulator Rubicon is a feedback inhibitor of CARD9-mediated host innate immunity.	Assembly of a scaffold consisting of CARD9, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex) is critical for effective signaling by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Dectin and RIG-I. The RUN domain Beclin-1-interacting cysteine-rich-containing Rubicon protein associates constitutively with the Beclin-UVRAG-Vps34 complex under normal conditions to regulate autophagy. Rubicon also interacts with the phagocytic NADPH-oxidase complex upon TLR stimulation to induce potent antimicrobial responses. Here, we show Rubicon is a physiological feedback inhibitor of CBM-mediated PRR signaling, preventing unbalanced proinflammatory responses. Upon Dectin-1- or RIG-I-mediated activation, Rubicon dynamically exchanges binding partners from 14-3-3β to CARD9 in a stimulation-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner, disassembling the CBM signaling complex and ultimately terminating PRR-induced cytokine production. Remarkably, Rubicon's actions in the autophagy complex, phagocytosis complex, and CBM complex are functionally and genetically separable. Rubicon thus differentially targets signaling complexes, depending on environmental stimuli, and may function to coordinate various immune responses against microbial infection.	2012	07	09	Cell Host Microbe	Yang	Chul-Su
22474286	10.1074/jbc.M111.291708	Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a protein activates nuclear factor κB through B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) protein and promotes tumor cell survival in serum deprivation.	FOXO3a, a member of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor family, is believed to be a tumor suppressor because it was found that FOXO3a inactivation promoted cell transformation and tumor progression. There are also a few studies showing that FOXO3a protected cells under stress conditions, including oxidative stress, serum deprivation, and hypoxia. It was reported that FOXO3a promoted invasion of cancer cells. Thus, the role of FOXO3a in cancer is complicated. Here, we report that FOXO3a is a positive regulator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. We found that overexpression of FOXO3a increased and knockdown of FOXO3a repressed NF-κB activities. Mechanistic studies indicate that FOXO3a activated NF-κB via inducing expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10), an upstream regulator of IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB signaling. We found that the serum deprivation activated NF-κB, which was blocked by inhibition of FOXO3a. Knockdown of FOXO3a enhanced cell apoptosis under serum-free conditions, which was inhibited by overexpression of BCL10. These results suggest that FOXO3a promotes cell survival via BCL10/NF-κB in serum starvation. Our findings may add another layer to the complexity of the role of FOXO3a in cancer. Therefore, caution should be taken when FOXO3a is employed as a target for cancer therapy.	2012	07	23	J Biol Chem	Li	Zhaodong
22528498	10.1074/jbc.M111.335463	Protein kinase C-δ negatively regulates T cell receptor-induced NF-κB activation by inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.	T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced T-cell activation is a critical event in adaptive immune responses. The engagement of TCR complex by antigen along with the activation of the costimulatory receptors trigger a cascade of intracellular signaling, in which caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase 1 (CARMA1) is a crucial scaffold protein. Upon stimulation, CARMA1 recruits downstream molecules including B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1), and TRAF6 to assemble a specific TCR-induced signalosome that triggers NF-κB and JNK activation. In this report, we identified protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as a CARMA1-associated protein by a biochemical affinity purification approach. PKCδ interacted with CARMA1 in TCR stimulation-dependent manner in Jurkat T cells. Overexpression of PKCδ inhibited CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas knockdown of PKCδ potentiated TCR-triggered NF-κB activation and IL-2 secretion in Jurkat T cells. Reconstitution experiments with PKCδ kinase-dead mutant indicated that the kinase activity of PKCδ was dispensable for its ability to inhibit TCR-triggered NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we found that PKCδ inhibited the interaction between MALT1 and TRAF6, but not the association of CARMA1 with PKCθ, Bcl10, or MALT1. These observations suggest that PKCδ is a negative regulator in T cell activation through inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.	2012	09	21	J Biol Chem	Liu	Yu
22564715	10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.04.047	Expression of BCL10 in cervical cancer has a role in the regulation of cell growth through the activation of NF-κB-dependent cyclin D1 signaling.	We recently characterized the molecular linkage that directs both BCL10 overexpression and nuclear translocation in response to inflammation-related NF-κB signaling pathway. Since NF-κB activation has been shown to occur in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, we sought to investigate whether BCL10 possesses clinical significance in relation to cervical cancer. Four cervical cancer cell lines (C33A, SiHa, HeLa, and CaSki) were used in this study. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was determined by the luciferase assay. The expression of BCL10, NF-κB, and cyclin D1 in tumor cells from an array of 182 tissue samples was examined using immunohistochemical staining. We transfected four cervical cancer cell lines with BCL10 small interfering RNA (siRNA), and discovered that the down-regulation of BCL10 inhibited the viability of these cervical cancer cells through G1 arrest. BCL10 siRNA treatment inhibited the expression of p-IKKβ and p-IκB, and also down-regulated both NF-κB activation cyclin D1, its downstream cell cycle protein. Our results reveal that cervical cancer had a higher rate of positive cytoplasmic staining (74.1%, 123/166) than either carcinoma in situ (50.0%, 3/6) or normal cervix (0.0%, 0/10); and that poorly differentiated cancer had a higher rate of cytoplasm staining (80.7%, 71/88) than moderately differentiated (75.4%, 43/57) and well differentiated (40%, 4/10) carcinoma. Furthermore, nuclear expression of BCL10 was closely associated with NF-κB activation (p&lt;0.001) and cyclin D1 expression (p&lt;0.001). Our findings indicate that BCL10 plays an important role in controlling the growth of cervical cancer cells through NF-κB dependent cyclin D1 regulation.	2012	11	09	Gynecol Oncol	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
22574776	10.1042/BJ20120414	Protease activity of MALT1: a mystery unravelled.	Constitutive NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) activation in B-cell lymphomas relies greatly on the CARMA1 [CARD (caspase recruitment domain)-containing MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) 1]-Bcl10-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue translocation gene 1) signalling complex. Within this protein complex, MALT1 possesses a rather unique enzymatic activity, which allows it to cleave Bcl10, RelB and CYLD, among other substrates. The catalytic activity of MALT1 promotes activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB as well as other signalling pathways. However, even after a decade of intense research on MALT1, many mechanistic aspects of its enzymatic activity remain elusive.

J. 443, 287-295] provides novel insight into the activation mechanism and the substrate specificity of MALT1. These intriguing findings convincingly demonstrate the importance of MALT1 dimerization for its catalytic activity and pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches that target this crucial regulator of lymphoma survival and proliferation.	2012	07	13	Biochem J	Kirchhofer	Daniel
22579587	10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.05.001	Prolongation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in human colonic epithelial cells by activation of an NFκB-BCL10 loop.	Carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide that is widely used as a food additive, induces inflammatory responses in animal models and human cells. The carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascades involve toll-like receptor (TLR)4- and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)10-dependent activation of NF-κB, leading to increased IL-8 production. Translocations involving BCL10 in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are associated with constitutive activation of NF-κB. This report presents a mechanism by which carrageenan exposure leads to prolonged activation of both BCL10 and NF-κB in human colonic epithelial cells. Study findings demonstrate that nuclear RelA and RelB bind to an NF-κB binding motif in the BCL10 promoter in human colonic epithelial NCM460 and HT-29 cells. In vitro oligonucleotide binding assay, non-radioactive gel shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) indicate binding of RelA and RelB to the BCL10 promoter. Prolonged inflammation follows activation of the BCL10-NFκB inflammatory loop in response to carrageenan, shown by increased BCL10, RelA, and IL-8 for 36 to 48h and increased RelB for 24h following withdrawal of carrageenan after 12h. In contrast, exposure to dextran sulfate sodium, which does not cause inflammation through TLR4 and BCL10 in the colonic epithelial cells, did not provoke prolonged activation of inflammation. The carrageenan-enhanced BCL10 promoter activity was blocked by caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and MB-132 which inhibit NF-κB activation. These results indicate that NF-κB binding to the BCL10 promoter can lead to prolonged activation of the carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascade by a transcriptional mechanism involving an NF-κB-BCL10 loop.	2013	01	18	Biochim Biophys Acta	Borthakur	Alip
22658522	10.1016/j.immuni.2012.04.008	Selective autophagy of the adaptor protein Bcl10 modulates T cell receptor activation of NF-κB.	The adaptor protein Bcl10 is a critically important mediator of T cell receptor (TCR)-to-NF-κB signaling. Bcl10 degradation is a poorly understood biological phenomenon suggested to reduce TCR activation of NF-κB. Here we have shown that TCR engagement triggers the degradation of Bcl10 in primary effector T cells but not in naive T cells. TCR engagement promoted K63 polyubiquitination of Bcl10, causing Bcl10 association with the autophagy adaptor p62. Paradoxically, p62 binding was required for both Bcl10 signaling to NF-κB and gradual degradation of Bcl10 by autophagy. Bcl10 autophagy was highly selective, as shown by the fact that it spared Malt1, a direct Bcl10 binding partner. Blockade of Bcl10 autophagy enhanced TCR activation of NF-κB. Together, these data demonstrate that selective autophagy of Bcl10 is a pathway-intrinsic homeostatic mechanism that modulates TCR signaling to NF-κB in effector T cells. This homeostatic process may protect T cells from adverse consequences of unrestrained NF-κB activation, such as cellular senescence.	2012	09	13	Immunity	Paul	Suman
22708078	10.1016/j.celrep.2012.04.006	Bcl10 links saturated fat overnutrition with hepatocellular NF-kB activation and insulin resistance.	Excess serum free fatty acids (FFAs) are fundamental to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. With high-fat feeding, FFAs activate NF-kB in target tissues, initiating negative crosstalk with insulin signaling. However, the mechanisms underlying FFA-dependent NF-kB activation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the saturated FA, palmitate, requires Bcl10 for NF-kB activation in hepatocytes. Uptake of palmitate, metabolism to diacylglycerol, and subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) appear to mechanistically link palmitate with Bcl10, known as a central component of a signaling complex that, along with CARMA3 and MALT1, activates NF-kB downstream of selected cell surface receptors. Consequently, Bcl10-deficient mice are protected from hepatic NF-kB activation and insulin resistance following brief high-fat diet, suggesting that Bcl10 plays a major role in the metabolic consequences of acute overnutrition. Surprisingly, while CARMA3 also participates in the palmitate response, MALT1 is completely dispensable, thereby revealing an apparent nonclassical role for Bcl10 in NF-kB signaling.	2013	04	17	Cell Rep	Van Beek	Matthew
22734454	10.3109/10520295.2012.695025	BCL10 expression is unrelated to clinico-pathological parameters or prognoses for oral squamous cell carcinomas.	BCL-10 (B-cell lymphoma 10) has been linked to a pro-apoptotic gene in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. We describe the expression of BCL10 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its relation to clinical, pathological and prognostic parameters. We carried out a retrospective study of 50 patients in Spain who were diagnosed with OSCC. We constructed a tissue microarray of the samples to study the expression of BCL10 using immunohistochemistry. Diffuse and homogeneous staining was observed in the nuclei and cytoplasms of most neoplastic cells of the vast majority of tumors and no significant differences were seen in different areas of the tumors. The expression was unrelated to any clinical or pathological parameters including tumor stage. The intra-class coefficient was 0.97, which indicates the minimal variability among the determinations.	2012	11	23	Biotech Histochem	Moar-Antelo	A R
22812606	10.1021/pr3000464	Role-shifting PKCζ fosters its own proapoptotic destruction by complexing with Bcl10 at the nuclear envelope of human cervical carcinoma cells: a proteomic and biochemical study.	Many features of deadly human cervical cancers (HCCs) still require elucidation. Among HCC-derived cell lines, here we used the C4-I one since its quantitative gene expression pattern most closely mimics invasive HCCs, including protein kinase-Cζ (PKCζ) overexpression. Via proteomic, bioinformatic, and biochemical approaches we identified 31 and 33 proteins co-immunoprecipitating with PKCζ from nuclear membranes (NMs) of, respectively, untreated or VP-16-exposed C4-I cells. Such proteins belonged to eight functional groups, whose compositions and relative sizes changed with either context. Of the 56 proteins identified, only eight were shared between the two subproteomes, including Bcl10. Surprisingly, proteins known to associate with Bcl10, like Carma1/3 and Malt1, in so-called CBM signalosomes were absent. Notably, in VP-16-treated C4-I cells, PKCζ•Bcl10 complexes increasingly accrued at NMs, where PKCζ phosphorylated Bcl10, as PKCζ also did in vitro and in cell-free systems, both processes being thwarted by interfering RNA (iRNA) PKCζ depletion. Caspase-3 was associated with PKCζ•Bcl10 complexes and proteolyzed PKCζ leading to its inactivation/destruction; both events were prevented by Bcl10 iRNA suppression. Thus, PKCζ's molecular interactions and functional roles changed strikingly according to the untreated or apoptogen-treated cells context, and by complexing with Bcl10, PKCζ surprisingly favored its own demise, which suggests both proteins as HCCs therapeutic targets.	2012	12	05	J Proteome Res	Chiarini	Anna
22818167	10.1016/j.humpath.2012.03.024	BCL10 down-regulation in peripheral T-cell lymphomas.	The BCL10 gene encodes for a T-cell receptor signaling downstream protein involved in nuclear factor κB activation. It is expressed in normal lymphoid tissues and in several B-non Hodgkin lymphomas, its aberrant function being related to the pathogenesis of certain subtypes. Conversely, conflicting data are available concerning BCL10 expression in peripheral T cell lymphomas. We analyzed BCL10 expression in peripheral T cell lymphomas and correlated it with NFκB activation, proliferation, phenotypic aberration, and survival. First, gene expression analysis of 40 peripheral T cell lymphomas (28 peripheral T cell lymphomas/not otherwise specified, 6 anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and 6 angioimmunoblastic lymphomas), 4 reactive lymph nodes, and 20 samples of normal T-lymphocytes, showed significantly lower BCL10 gene expression in all tumors in comparison to normal samples, the lowest values being detected in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Secondly, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of BCL10 in 52 peripheral T cell lymphomas/not otherwise specified on tissue microarrays. BCL10 was expressed in 10/52 cases (19%), not showing any significant correlation with either expression of Ki-67 and the T-cell markers or NFκB activation. Furthermore, BCL10 expression was not associated with peculiar gene expression profiles. Finally, we did not find significant correlations with progression free survival and overall survival, although a favorable trend was recorded in BCL10(+) cases. In conclusion, BCL10 was commonly down-regulated in peripheral T cell lymphomas, suggest the T-cell receptor signaling cascade for future characterization.	2013	02	05	Hum Pathol	Rossi	Maura
22842723	10.3892/or.2012.1942	Breast MALT lymphomas: a clinicopathological and cytogenetic study of 9 cases.	Primary breast mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are uncommon and restricted diagnostic criteria should be used to exclude breast involvement by systemic lymphomas. The molecular pathogenesis of primary breast MALT lymphomas is not clear because of the rarity of the disease. Generally the molecular studies of MALT lymphoma in extranodal sites have shown the presence of different chromosomal aberrations, mutually exclusive with substantial differences in their frequency relatively to topographic localization. Few cases of breast MALT lymphomas in the literature have been assessed for MALT lymphoma-associated translocations and BCL10 expression, underlying their rarity in primary breast MALT lymphomas. In our study, we analyzed a series of nine cases of primary breast MALT lymphomas. FISH results showed evidence of MALT1 gene rearrangements in four primary breast lymphomas, in particular three cases with t(11;18)(q21;q21) and one case with t(14;18)(q32;q21). In addition, BCL10 gene rearrangement was not observed. There was no evidence of BCL10 gene translocation in any of the neoplasms assessed. Our data indicate that MALT1 gene rearrangements are not rare in primary breast MALT lymphoma in contrast with results of previous series. Finally, t(11;18) has been observed to be significantly associated with high intensity cytoplasmic BCL10 expression underlying cross-talk between MALT1 and BCL10 pathways in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas.	2013	05	09	Oncol Rep	Liguori	Giuseppina
22880103	10.1371/journal.pone.0042775	Structural insights into the assembly of CARMA1 and BCL10.	The CBM complex (CARMA1, BCL10 and MALT1) plays a crucial role in B and T lymphocyte activation. CARMA1 serves as a scaffold for BCL10, MALT1 and other effector proteins and regulates various signaling pathways related to the immune response. The assembly of CARMA1 and BCL10 is mediated through a CARD-CARD interaction. Here, we report the crystal structure of the CARD domain of CARMA1 at a resolution of 1.75 Å. The structure consists of six helices, as previously determined for CARD domains. Structural and computational analysis identified the binding interface between CARMA1-CARD and BCL10-CARD, which consists of a basic patch in CARMA1 and an acidic patch in BCL10. Site-directed mutagenesis, co-immunoprecipitation and an NF-κB activation assay confirmed that the interface is necessary for association and downstream signaling. Our studies provide molecular insight into the assembly of CARMA1 and BCL10.	2013	01	10	PLoS One	Li	Siwei
23035874	10.1186/1423-0127-19-85	BCL10GFP fusion protein as a substrate for analysis of determinants required for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1)-mediated cleavage.	MALT1 belongs to a family of paracaspase and modulates NF-κB signaling pathways through its scaffolding function and proteolytic activity. MALT1 cleaves protein substrates after a positively charged Arginine residue. BCL10, a 233 amino acids polypeptide, is identified as one of the MALT1 proteolytic substrates. MALT1 cleaves BCL10 at the C-terminal end of Arg228. A mere 5 amino acids difference between the substrate and the proteolytic product made it difficult to tell whether the cleavage event took place by using a simple western blot analysis. Here, BCL10GFP was constructed and utilized to examine the specificity and domain determinants for MALT1 cleavage in cells. Various BCL10GFP constructs were transfected into HEK293T cell with MALT1 construct by using calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method. Lysates of transfectants were resolved by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by western blot analysis. BCL10GFP was proteolytically processed by MALT1 as BCL10. The integrity of caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and MALT1-interacting domain on BCL10 were required for MALT1 proteolytic activity. Besides the invariant P1 cleavage site Arg228, P4 Leu225 played a role in defining BCL10 as a good substrate for MALT1. We offered a way of monitoring the catalytic activity of MALT1 in HEK293T cells using BCL10GFP as a substrate. BCL10GFP can be utilized as a convenient tool for studying the determinants for efficient MALT1 cleavage in HEK293T cells.	2013	04	03	J Biomed Sci	Jou	Shin-Yi
23087406	10.4049/jimmunol.1102952	Critical role of B cell lymphoma 10 in BAFF-regulated NF-κB activation and survival of anergic B cells.	Anergy is a key physiological mechanism for restraining self-reactive B cells. A marked portion of peripheral B cells are anergic B cells that largely depend on BAFF for survival. BAFF activates the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, both of which are required for B cell survival. In this study we report that deficiency of the adaptor protein B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) impaired the ability of BAFF to support B cell survival in vitro, and it specifically increased apoptosis in anergic B cells in vivo, dramatically reducing anergic B cells in mice. Bcl10-dependent survival of self-reactive anergic B cells was confirmed in the Ig hen egg lysozyme/soluble hen egg lysozyme double-transgenic mouse model of B cell anergy. Furthermore, we found that BAFF stimulation induced Bcl10 association with IκB kinase β, a key component of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Consistently, Bcl10-deficient B cells were impaired in BAFF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and formation of nuclear p50/c-Rel complexes. Bcl10-deficient B cells also displayed reduced expression of NF-κB2/p100, severely reducing BAFF-induced nuclear accumulation of noncanonical p52/RelB complexes. Consequently, Bcl10-deficient B cells failed to express Bcl-x(L), a BAFF-induced NF-κB target gene. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bcl10 controls BAFF-induced canonical NF-κB activation directly and noncanonical NF-κB activation indirectly. The BAFF-R/Bcl10/NF-κB signaling axis plays a critical role in peripheral B cell tolerance by regulating the survival of self-reactive anergic B cells.	2013	01	18	J Immunol	Yu	Mei
23153494	10.1016/j.devcel.2012.09.021	The NF-κB signaling protein Bcl10 regulates actin dynamics by controlling AP1 and OCRL-bearing vesicles.	The protein Bcl10 contributes to adaptive and innate immunity through the assembly of a signaling complex that plays a key role in antigen receptor and FcR-induced NF-κB activation. Here we demonstrate that Bcl10 has an NF-κB-independent role in actin and membrane remodeling downstream of FcR in human macrophages. Depletion of Bcl10 impaired Rac1 and PI3K activation and led to an abortive phagocytic cup rich in PI(4,5)P(2), Cdc42, and F-actin, which could be rescued with low doses of F-actin depolymerizing drugs. Unexpectedly, we found Bcl10 in a complex with the clathrin adaptors AP1 and EpsinR. In particular, Bcl10 was required to locally deliver the vesicular OCRL phosphatase that regulates PI(4,5)P(2) and F-actin turnover, both crucial for the completion of phagosome closure. Thus, we identify Bcl10 as an early coordinator of NF-κB-mediated immune response with endosomal trafficking and signaling to F-actin remodeling.	2013	01	31	Dev Cell	Marion	Sabrina

20830719	10.1002/ijc.25663	BCL6 gene rearrangement and protein expression are associated with large cell presentation of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.	Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) is an indolent B-cell lymphoma, which is often localized in the stomach. It is characterized by typical morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and expression profile. The coexistence of a large B-cell lymphoma and a MALT lymphoma in the gastrointestinal tract is defined as a composite lymphoma (ComL) and, as we have previously shown, is almost always the consequence of secondary transformation of MALT lymphoma. Here, we have analyzed a panel of seven MALT lymphomas, seven ComL and thirteen large cell variants of marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBL) using FISH for the detection of rearrangements of IGH, MALT1, BCL6, BCL10 and FOXP1 and immunohistochemistry for Bcl6, Bcl10 and FoxP1. Translocations involving IGH were found in 10/27 lymphomas including two cases with IGH-BCL6 fusion and one with IGH-BCL10 fusion; in 7/10 cases, the translocation partner was not identified. Bcl10 and FoxP1 protein expression was heterogeneous throughout the series. Genetic rearrangements of BCL6 and Bcl6 protein expression were found almost exclusively in the large cell components of the ComL and the large cell extranodal MZBL (p = 0.2093 and p = 0.0261, respectively). These findings suggest Bcl6 as a marker for transformation of MALT lymphoma.	2011	07	04	Int J Cancer	Flossbach	Lucia
21187856	10.1038/cr.2010.182	NF-κB signaling pathways regulated by CARMA family of scaffold proteins.	The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in cell activation, survival and proliferation. Its aberrant activity results in cancer, immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorders. Over the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the signals that regulate NF-κB activation, especially how scaffold proteins link different receptors to the NF-κB-activating complex, the IκB kinase complex. The growing number of these scaffolds underscores the complexity of the signaling networks in different cell types. In this review, we discuss the role of scaffold molecules in signaling cascades induced by stimulation of antigen receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors and C-type Lectin receptors, resulting in NF-κB activation. Especially, we focus on the family of Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins known as CARMA and their function in activation of NF-κB, as well as the link of these scaffolds to the development of various neoplastic diseases through regulation of NF-κB.	2011	04	12	Cell Res	Blonska	Marzenna
21199863	10.1074/jbc.M110.155895	The Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin controls the formation of the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex during T cell receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation.	T cell receptor (TCR) ligation induces increased diacylglycerol and Ca(2+) levels in T cells, and both secondary messengers are crucial for TCR-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and NF-κB signaling pathways. One prominent calcium-dependent enzyme involved in the regulation of NF-AT and NF-κB signaling pathways is the protein phosphatase calcineurin. However, in contrast to NF-AT, which is directly dephosphorylated by calcineurin, the molecular basis of the calcium-calcineurin dependence of the TCR-induced NF-κB activity remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that calcineurin regulates TCR-induced NF-κB activity by controlling the formation of a protein complex composed of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1 (CBM complex). For instance, increased calcium levels induced by ionomycin or thapsigargin augmented the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced formation of the CBM complex and activation of NF-κB, whereas removal of calcium by the calcium chelator EGTA-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) attenuated both processes. Furthermore, inhibition of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CsA) or FK506 as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of calcineurin A strongly affected the PMA + ionomycin- or anti-CD3 + CD28-induced CBM complex assembly. Mechanistically, the positive effect of calcineurin on the CBM complex formation seems to be linked to a dephosphorylation of Bcl10. For instance, Bcl10 was found to be hyperphosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon treatment with CsA or EGTA-AM, and calcineurin dephosphorylated Bcl10 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we show here that calcineurin A interacts with the CBM complex. In summary, the evidence provided here argues for a previously unanticipated role of calcineurin in CBM complex formation as a molecular basis of the inhibitory function of CsA or FK506 on TCR-induced NF-κB activity.	2011	05	04	J Biol Chem	Palkowitsch	Lysann
21261681	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03699.x	MALT lymphoma: many roads lead to nuclear factor-κb activation.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is characterized genetically by several recurrent, but mutually exclusive, chromosome translocations. To date, it has been shown that at least the oncogenic products of t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, t(14;18)(q32;21)/IGH-MALT1 and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1 activate the nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation pathway. Recently, A20, an essential global NF-κB inhibitor, was found to be inactivated by somatic deletion and/or mutation in translocation-negative MALT lymphomas. However, these genetic abnormalities alone are not sufficient for malignant transformation and thus need to cooperate with other factors in MALT lymphomagenesis. Recent studies have shown steady, exciting progresses in our understanding of the biological functions of BCL10, MALT1 and A20 in the regulation of the NF-κB activation pathways and the biology of lymphocytes. This review discusses the implication of these recent advances in the molecular pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma, and explores how the above genetic abnormalities cooperate with immunological stimulation in the development of lymphoma.	2011	08	19	Histopathology	Du	Ming-Qing
21283787	10.1371/journal.ppat.1001259	Selective C-Rel activation via Malt1 controls anti-fungal T(H)-17 immunity by dectin-1 and dectin-2.	C-type lectins dectin-1 and dectin-2 on dendritic cells elicit protective immunity against fungal infections through induction of T(H)1 and T(H)-17 cellular responses. Fungal recognition by dectin-1 on human dendritic cells engages the CARD9-Bcl10-Malt1 module to activate NF-κB. Here we demonstrate that Malt1 recruitment is pivotal to T(H)-17 immunity by selective activation of NF-κB subunit c-Rel, which induces expression of T(H)-17-polarizing cytokines IL-1β and IL-23p19. Malt1 inhibition abrogates c-Rel activation and T(H)-17 immunity to Candida species. We found that Malt1-mediated activation of c-Rel is similarly essential to induction of T(H)-17-polarizing cytokines by dectin-2. Whereas dectin-1 activates all NF-κB subunits, dectin-2 selectively activates c-Rel, signifying a specialized T(H)-17-enhancing function for dectin-2 in anti-fungal immunity by human dendritic cells. Thus, dectin-1 and dectin-2 control adaptive T(H)-17 immunity to fungi via Malt1-dependent activation of c-Rel.	2011	05	05	PLoS Pathog	Gringhuis	Sonja I
21396111	10.1186/1478-811X-9-6	B cell antigen receptor-induced activation of an IRAK4-dependent signaling pathway revealed by a MALT1-IRAK4 double knockout mouse model.	The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and pathogen recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), act in concert to control adaptive B cell responses. However, little is known about the signaling pathways that integrate BCR activation with intrinsic TLR4 stimulation. Antigen receptors initialize activation of the inducible transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) via recruitment of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase caspase recruitment domain protein 11 (CARD11), the adapter molecule B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), and the ""paracaspase"" mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) into lipid rafts. Upon BCR triggering, this activation strictly depends on BCL10, but not on MALT1, leading to the hypothesis that a MALT1-independent NF-κB activation pathway contributes to BCR-induced NF-κB activation downstream of BCL10. The identity of this pathway has remained elusive. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that the IRAK4- and IRAK1-dependent TLR signaling branch is activated upon BCR triggering to induce partial NF-κB activation. BCR-induced MALT1-independent IκB degradation and B cell proliferation were inhibited in MALT1/IRAK4 double knockout B cells. Moreover, IRAK1 was recruited into lipid rafts upon BCR stimulation and activated following transient recruitment of IRAK4. We propose that the observed crosstalk between BCR and TLR signaling components may contribute to the discrimination of signals that emanate from single and dual receptor engagement to control adaptive B cell responses.	2011	07	14	Cell Commun Signal	Dufner	Almut
21406399	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3626	CARMA3 is crucial for EGFR-Induced activation of NF-κB and tumor progression.	EGF activates NF-κB, and constitutively activated NF-κB contributes to EGFR mutation-associated tumorigenesis, but it remains unclear precisely how EGFR signaling leads to NF-κB activation. Here we report that CARMA3, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing scaffold molecule, is required for EGF-induced NF-κB activation. CARMA3 deficiency impaired the activation of the IKK complex following EGF stimulation, resulting in a defect of EGF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. We found that CARMA3 and Bcl10 contributed to several characteristics of EGFR-associated malignancy, including proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. Most importantly, CARMA3 contributed to tumor growth in vivo. Our findings elucidate a crucial link between EGFR-proximal signaling components and the downstream IKK complex, and they suggest a new therapeutic target for treatment of EGFR-driven cancers.	2011	07	25	Cancer Res	Jiang	Tang
21489413	10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.03.025	CD4 ligation excludes the Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex from GM1-positive membrane rafts in CD3/CD28 activated T cells.	The antibody 13B8.2, which is directed against the CDR3-like loop on the D1 domain of CD4, induces CD4/ZAP-70 reorganization and ceramide release in membrane rafts. Here, we investigated whether CD4/ZAP-70 compartmentalization could be mediated by an effect of 13B8.2 on the Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex in membrane rafts. We report that treatment of CD3/CD28-activated Jurkat T cells with 13B8.2, but not rituximab, excluded Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 proteins from GM1(+) membrane rafts and concomitantly decreased NF-κB activation. Fluorescence confocal imaging confirmed that Carma1-Bcl10 and Carma1-MALT1 co-patching, observed in GM1(+) membrane rafts following CD3/CD28 activation, were abrogated after a 24h-treatment with 13B8.2. The CD4/ZAP-70 compartmentalization in membrane rafts induced by 13B8.2 is thus related to Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 raft exclusion.	2011	10	04	Cell Immunol	Rigo	Maxime
21513986	10.1016/j.molimm.2011.03.020	CaMKII targets Bcl10 in T-cell receptor induced activation of NF-κB.	Recognition of antigen by T- or B-cell receptors leads to formation of an immunological synapse and initiation of signalling events that collaborate to determine the nature of the adaptive immune response. Activation of NF-κB transcription factors has a key role in regulation of numerous genes with important functions in immune responses and inflammation and is of great importance for lymphocyte activation and differentiation. The activation of NF-κB depends on changes in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and both calmodulin (CaM) and a CaM-dependent kinase, CaMKII, help regulate NF-κB activation after T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, but the mechanisms are not well characterized. Here we have analyzed the functional role of CaMKII in the signalling pathway from the TCR to activation of IKK, the kinase that phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB. We show that CaMKII is recruited to the immunological synapse where it interacts with and phosphorylates the signalling adaptor protein Bcl10. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the CARD domain of Bcl10 by CaMKII regulates the interactions within the important Carma1, Bcl10, Malt1 signalling complex and the essential signal induced ubiquitinations of Bcl10 and IKKγ. We propose a novel mechanism whereby Ca(2+) signals can be integrated at the immunological synapse through CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl10.	2011	08	10	Mol Immunol	Oruganti	Sreenivasa Rao
21674474	10.1002/eji.201041052	Dephosphorylation of Bcl-10 by calcineurin is essential for canonical NF-κB activation in Th cells.	Antigen-specific stimulation of T helper (Th) cells initiates signaling cascades that ultimately result in the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1 which regulate, together with other factors, many T-cell functions such as cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation. Ordered assembly and different phosphorylation events, along with subcellular translocation of the CARMA1/Bcl-10/MALT1 complex, determine NF-κB activation after T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering. We now provide evidence that inhibition of the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) prevents dephosphorylation of Bcl-10. CaN, in constant interaction with the Bcl-10/MALT1 complex, is able to dephosphorylate Bcl-10. The CaN inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) converts a transient phosphorylation of Bcl-10 Ser138 during the immediate early phase of T-cell activation into a persistent state. Thus, subsequent processes such as IKKβ phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and DNA binding are diminished. Consistently, CsA treatment does not affect the phosphorylation pattern of the upstream kinase PKCθ. Together, our findings demonstrate that CaN functions as a critical signaling molecule during Th cell activation, regulating Bcl-10 phosphorylation and thereby NF-κB activation.	2011	10	03	Eur J Immunol	Frischbutter	Stefan
21700900	10.1152/ajpgi.00071.2011	Specific effects of BCL10 Serine mutations on phosphorylations in canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation following carrageenan.	To determine the impact of B cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL) 10 on the phosphorylation of crucial mediators in NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways, human colonic epithelial cells were exposed to carrageenan (CGN), a sulfated polysaccharide commonly used as a food additive and known to induce NF-κB nuclear translocation by both canonical and noncanonical pathways. Phosphorylations of intermediates in inflammatory cascades, including NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) at Thr(559), transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase (TAK) 1 at Thr(184), Thr(187), and Ser(192), and inhibitory factor κBα (IκBα) at Ser(32), were examined following mutation of BCL10 at Ser(138) and at Ser(218). Specific phosphoantibodies were used for detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy of differences in phosphorylation following transfection by mutated BCL10. Both mutations demonstrated dominant-negative effects, with inhibition of phospho(Ser(32))-IκBα to less than control levels. Both of the BCL10 mutations reduced the CGN-induced increases in nuclear RelA and p50, but only the Ser(138) mutation inhibited the CGN-induced increases in nuclear RelB and p52 and in NIK Thr(559) phosphorylation. Hence, the phosphorylation of BCL10 Ser(138), but not Ser(218), emerged as a critical event in activation of the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation. Either BCL10 Ser(138) or Ser(218) mutation inhibited the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr(184) and at Thr(187), but not at Ser(192). These findings indicate that BCL10 phosphorylations act upstream of phosphorylations of NIK, TAK1, and IκBα and differentially affect the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation.	2011	10	20	Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
21745165	10.3109/10428194.2011.596968	Thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue: a clinicopathological and genetic analysis of six cases.	We investigated six new cases of primary thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) to further characterize the clinicopathological and genetic features. The male to female ratio was 1:1. One female patient had suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus. Another female patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis after thymectomy. One patient had a concurrent tumor in the eyelid. Radiologically, all tumors were located in the prevascular space and presented as asymmetric heterogeneously enhanced cystic and solid masses. MALT1, BCL10 or IGH translocations and trisomy 18 were not observed in any cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Trisomy 3 was detected in one patient and another showed a TNFAIP3/A20 deletion. Meta-analysis (n = 51) including the present and previously reported cases revealed that the prevalence of autoimmunity was much lower in males with thymic MALT lymphoma compared to females (33% vs. 87%, p = 0.001). Additionally, the average age of females or patients with autoimmunity was about 10 years younger than that of males or patients without autoimmunity (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008, respectively). In summary, thymic MALT lymphoma arising without underlying autoimmunity frequently involves males or older patients. Trisomy 3 and an A20 deletion might play a role in the pathogenesis of thymic MALT lymphoma.	2012	07	13	Leuk Lymphoma	Go	Heounjeong
21750409	10.4161/cc.10.15.16923	From MALT lymphoma to the CBM signalosome: three decades of discovery.	The advent of molecular cytogenetics has led to the elucidation of genetic abnormalities that cause various congenital and oncological disorders. In B cell lymphoma, for example, a number of chromosomal translocations have been identified in and associated with the etiology of specific subtypes of lymphoma. Several recurrent chromosomal translocations have been identified in extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). Cloning and characterization of the products of three mutually exclusive translocation breakpoints found in MALT lymphoma led to the discovery of a novel NF-κB-activating complex comprising the CARMA, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins. This ""CBM signalosome"" acts downstream of the antigen receptors in lymphocytes as well as a number of non-lymphoid cell-surface receptors involved in a variety of biological processes. CBM signalosome activity is important for normal cellular functions and is perturbed in neoplastic and inflammatory disorders, making it a viable target for novel therapeutic design.	2011	12	13	Cell Cycle	Rosebeck	Shaun
21837708	10.1002/gcc.20910	Establishment of a novel MALT lymphoma cell line, ma-1, from a patient with t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive Helicobacter pylori-independent gastric MALT lymphoma.	Although t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and a few other genetic mutations are specific markers for the Helicobacter pylori (HP)-independent status of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the molecular mechanisms responsible for HP-independence of gastric MALT lymphoma without such translocations and mutations remain uncharacterized. In the present study, we describe the establishment and characterization of a novel MALT lymphoma cell line, MA-1, which was derived from a gastric MALT lymphoma which was negative for both t(11;18)(q21;q21) and t(1;14)(p22;q32); the patient had failed HP eradication therapy and chemotherapy. The cell morphology and the immunophenotype of this cell line were similar to that of the original gastric MALT lymphoma. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed no significant gene copy number changes. Spectral karyotyping displayed a near-diploid chromosome content (48 &lt; 2n&gt;XY), with at least 13 chromosome structural abnormalities. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses disclosed the existence of three sub-clones, characterized by t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2, t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, and the presence of both chromosomal translocations in the same cell, respectively; whereas amplification of the genes CRAD9, TRAF2, and BCL10 were not found. In conclusion, we have established the first human gastric MALT lymphoma cell line, which is characterized by unusual and complex chromosome translocations and will be useful to explore further the molecular mechanisms of HP-independence in gastric MALT lymphoma.	2012	03	15	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
21862580	10.1074/jbc.M111.259549	Akt fine-tunes NF-κB-dependent gene expression during T cell activation.	Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway is critical for leukocyte activation and development. Although previous studies suggested a role for the Akt kinase in coupling the T cell antigen receptor and CD28 to NF-κB activation in T cells, the nature of the role of Akt in this pathway is still unclear. Using a targeted gene profiling approach, we found that a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes required Akt for optimal up-regulation during T cell activation. The selective effects of Akt were manifest at the level of mRNA transcription and p65/RelA binding to upstream promoters and appear to be due to altered formation of the Carma1-Bcl10 complex. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α was found to be particularly sensitive to Akt inhibition or knockdown, including in primary human blood T cells and a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings are consistent with a hierarchy in the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, controlled by the strength and/or duration of NF-κB signaling. More broadly, our results suggest that defining the more graded effects of signaling, such as those demonstrated here for Akt and the NF-κB pathway, is important to understanding how cells can fine-tune signaling responses for optimal sensitivity and specificity.	2011	12	12	J Biol Chem	Cheng	Jing
21896478	10.1074/jbc.M111.263384	The E3 ubiquitin ligase mind bomb-2 (MIB2) protein controls B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-dependent NF-κB activation.	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) is crucial for the activation of NF-κB in numerous immune receptor signaling pathways, including the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to signal transduction from BCL10 to downstream NF-κB effector kinases, such as TAK1 and components of the IKK complex, are not entirely understood. Here we used a proteomic approach and identified the E3 ligase MIB2 as a novel component of the activated BCL10 complex. In vitro translation and pulldown assays suggest direct interaction between BCL10 and MIB2. Overexpression experiments show that MIB2 controls BCL10-mediated activation of NF-κB by promoting autoubiquitination and ubiquitination of IKKγ/NEMO, as well as recruitment and activation of TAK1. Knockdown of MIB2 inhibited BCL10-dependent NF-κB activation. Together, our results identify MIB2 as a novel component of the activated BCL10 signaling complex and a missing link in the BCL10-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway.	2011	12	15	J Biol Chem	Stempin	Cinthia C
22158899	10.1073/pnas.1111708108	Crystal structure of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) paracaspase region.	The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) paracaspase, a key component of the Carma1/Bcl10/MALT1 signalosome, is critical for NF-κB signaling in multiple contexts. MALT1 is thought to function as a scaffold and protease to promote signaling; however, the biochemical and structural basis of paracaspase action remains largely unknown. Here we report the 1.75-Å resolution crystal structure of the MALT1 paracaspase region, which contains the paracaspase domain and an ensuing Ig-like domain. The paracaspase and the Ig domains appear as a single folding unit and interact with each other through extensive van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. The paracaspase domain adopts a fold that is nearly identical to that of classic caspases and homodimerizes similarly to form an active protease. Unlike caspases, the active and mature form of the paracaspase domain remains a single uncleaved polypeptide and specifically recognizes the bound peptide inhibitor Val-Arg-Pro-Arg. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid Arg of the inhibitor is coordinated by three highly conserved acidic residues. This structure serves as an important framework for deciphering the function and mechanism of paracaspases exemplified by MALT1.	2012	02	21	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Yu	Jong W
19714753	10.1002/ibd.21092	Platelet-activating factor-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells are Bcl10-dependent.	Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory phospholipid mediator, has been implicated in inducing intestinal inflammation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, its mechanisms of inducing inflammatory responses are not fully understood. Therefore, studies were designed to explore the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammatory cascade in intestinal epithelial cells. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was measured by luciferase assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) production was determined by ELISA. B-cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 3 (CARMA3), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) mRNA and protein levels were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. siRNA silencing of Bcl10 was used to examine its role in PAF-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production. The promoter region of the Bcl10 gene was cloned with the PCR method and promoter activity measured by luciferase assay. The adaptor protein Bcl10 appeared to play an important role in the PAF-induced inflammatory pathway in human intestinal epithelial cells. Bcl10 was required for PAF-induced I kappaB alpha phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and IL-8 production in NCM460, a cell line derived from normal human colon, and Caco-2, a transformed human intestinal cell line. PAF also stimulated Bcl10 interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1, and upregulated Bcl10 expression in these cells via transcriptional regulation. These findings highlight a novel PAF-induced inflammatory pathway in intestinal epithelial cells, requiring Bcl10 as a critical mediator and involving CARMA3/Bcl10/MALT1 interactions. The proinflammatory effects of PAF play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of IBD and this pathway may present important targets for intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine.	2010	07	27	Inflamm Bowel Dis	Borthakur	Alip
19864123	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.07.002	Carrageenan-induced innate immune response is modified by enzymes that hydrolyze distinct galactosidic bonds.	The common food additive carrageenan (CGN) predictably induces intestinal inflammation in animal models. Mechanisms of CGN-induced nuclear factor κB and interleukin-8 (IL-8) stimulation include an immune-mediated pathway involving toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated pathway. To determine how the structure of CGN contributes to its initiation of inflammation through these two distinct mechanisms, we treated CGNs with galactosidases and carrageenases (CGNases) and determined the impact on IL-8 secretion and BCL10 production. Hydrolysis of CGN by the enzyme α-1→(3,6)-galactosidase significantly reduced increases in IL-8 and BCL10, but other galactosidases tested, including α-1→6-galactosidase, β-1→4-galactosidase and β-1→3,6-galactosidase, had no effect. In contrast, specific κ-CGNases or ι-CGNases, which hydrolyze β-1,4-galactosidic bonds, produced increases in IL-8 and BCL10 attributable to increased exposure of the immunogenic α-1→3-galactosidic epitope of CGN to TLR4. These results were consistent with induction of innate immune response by an interaction of TLR4 with the unusual α-d-Gal-(1→3)-d-Gal epitope present in CGN. Activation of the ROS-mediated pathway was unaffected by treatment of κ-CGN with either κ-CGNase (3 mg/L), α-1→(3,6)-galactosidase (20 mU/ml) or these enzymes in combination, indicating that changes in IL-8 production were attributable to the effects of induction of inflammation on the TLR4-BCL10-mediated innate immune pathway. These findings provide new information about the specificity of carbohydrate-protein interaction between CGN and TLR4 and may help to devise treatments that modify the immune reactivity induced by carbohydrate antigens.	2011	01	28	J Nutr Biochem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
19897484	10.1074/jbc.M109.050815	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) is required for NF-kappaB production by both canonical and noncanonical pathways and for NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) phosphorylation.	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein involved in the etiology of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, has been implicated in inflammatory processes in epithelial cells, as well as in immune cells. Experiments in this report indicate that BCL10 is required for activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB by both canonical and noncanonical pathways, following stimulation by the sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan (CGN). In wild type and IkappaB-kinase (IKK)alpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, increases in phospho-IkappaBalpha, nuclear NF-kappaB p65 (RelA) and p50, and KC, the mouse analog of human interleukin-8, were markedly reduced by silencing BCL10 or by exposure to the free radical scavenger Tempol. In IKKbeta(-/-) cells, BCL10 silencing, but not Tempol, reduced the CGN-induced increases in KC, phospho-NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytoplasmic NF-kappaB p100, and nuclear NF-kappaB p52 and RelB, suggesting a BCL10 requirement for activation of the noncanonical pathway. In NCM460 cells, derived from normal, human colonic epithelium, the CGN-induced increases in NF-kappaB family members, p65, p50, p52, and RelB, were inhibited by BCL10 silencing. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confocal images demonstrated no change in total NIK following CGN, increases in phospho-NIK in the wild type, IKKbeta(-/-) and IKKalpha(-/-) cells were inhibited by silencing BCL10. These findings indicate an upstream signaling role for BCL10, in addition to its effects on IKKgamma, the regulatory component of the IKK signalosome, and a requirement for BCL10 in both canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-kappaB activation. Also, the commonly used food additive carrageenan can be added to the short list of known activators of both pathways.	2010	01	26	J Biol Chem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
19950170	10.1002/eji.200939445	c-Rel phenocopies PKCtheta but not Bcl-10 in regulating CD8+ T-cell activation versus tolerance.	Elucidating the signaling events that promote T-cell tolerance versus activation provides important insights for manipulating immunity in vivo. Previous studies have suggested that the absence of PKCtheta results in the induction of anergy and that the balance between the induction of the transcription factors NFAT, AP1 and NF-kappaB plays a key role in determining whether T-cell anergy or activation is induced. Here, we examine whether Bcl-10 and specific family members of NF-kappaB act downstream of PKCtheta to alter CD8(+) T-cell activation and/or anergy. We showed that T cells from mice deficient in c-Rel but not NF-kappaB1 (p50) have increased susceptibility to the induction of anergy, similar to T cells from PKCtheta-deficient mice. Surprisingly T cells from Bcl-10-deficient mice showed a strikingly different phenotype to the PKCtheta-deficient T cells, with a severe block in TCR-mediated activation. Furthermore, we have also shown that survival signals downstream of NF-kappaB, are uncoupled from signals that mediate T-cell anergy. These results suggest that c-Rel plays a critical role downstream of PKCtheta in controlling CD8(+) T-cell anergy induction.	2010	04	16	Eur J Immunol	Deenick	Elissa K
20193035	10.1111/j.1744-313X.2010.00898.x	BCL10 as a new candidate gene for immune response in pigs: cloning, expression and association analysis.	BCL10 is an apoptotic regulatory molecule identified through its direct involvement in t(1; 14)(p22; q32) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and was implicated in the pathogenesis of this and several other tumour types. BCL10 was recognized as an antigen receptor-specific regulator of NF-kappaB, which showed close association with immune responses. In this study, we cloned and characterized BCL10 from the porcine spleen and analysed its genomic structure. BCL10 was mapped to SSC4q21-q23 by the IMpRH panels, it is closely linked to the marker S0161 and SW1461. This gene has three exons and two introns. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that BCL10 was widely expressed in all the examined tissues. Transient transfection indicated that porcine BCL10 was located in cytoplasm in Pig Kidney Epithelial cells. BCL10 gene displays the opposite expression trend between the two treatments mimic virus and bacteria of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The level of the BCL10 mRNA was up-regulated during 12-24 h and peaking at 48 h when treated with LPS, whereas it was down-regulated during 0-48 h and highest at 0 h (cells without treating with Poly I:C) when treated with Poly I:C. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site was identified in the 3'-untranslated region of porcine BCL10. Association analysis revealed that this SNP was significantly associated with intermediate cell mass (eosinophile granulocyte, basophile granulocyte and histoleucocyte) percentage, absolute intermediate cell mass count and mean red blood cell volume of 0-day-old pigs, and red blood cell count of 17-day-old pigs (P &lt; 0.05), and also had significant associations with red blood cell count and haemoglobin concentration of 32-day-old pigs (P &lt; 0.01).	2010	08	30	Int J Immunogenet	Huang	J
20235165	10.1002/path.2699	Interleukin-2 induces NF-kappaB activation through BCL10 and affects its subcellular localization in natural killer lymphoma cells.	Deregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signalling is common in cancers and is essential for tumourigenesis. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation in extranodal natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL) is known to be associated with aberrant nuclear translocation of BCL10. Here we investigated the mechanisms leading to NF-kappaB activation and BCL10 nuclear localization in ENKLs. Given that ENKLs are dependent on T-cell-derived interleukin-2 (IL2) for cytotoxicity and proliferation, we investigated whether IL2 modulates NF-kappaB activation and BCL10 subcellular localization in ENKLs. In the present study, IL2-activated NK lymphoma cells were found to induce NF-kappaB activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to an increase in the entry of G(2)/M phase and concomitant transcription of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. We also found that BCL10, a key mediator of NF-kappaB signalling, participates in the cytokine receptor-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Knockdown of BCL10 expression resulted in deficient NF-kappaB signalling, whereas Akt activation was unaffected. Our results suggest that BCL10 plays a role downstream of Akt in the IL2-triggered NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Moreover, the addition of IL2 to NK cells led to aberrant nuclear translocation of BCL10, which is a pathological feature of ENKLs. We further show that BCL10 can bind to BCL3, a transcriptional co-activator and nuclear protein. Up-regulation of BCL3 expression was observed in response to IL2. Similar to BCL10, the expression and nuclear translocation of BCL3 were induced by IL2 in an Akt-dependent manner. The nuclear translocation of BCL10 was also dependent on BCL3 because silencing BCL3 by RNA interference abrogated this translocation. We identified a critical role for BCL10 in the cytokine receptor-induced NF-kappaB signalling pathway, which is essential for NK cell activation. We also revealed the underlying mechanism that controls BCL10 nuclear translocation in NK cells. Our findings provide insight into a molecular network within the NF-kappaB signalling pathway that promotes the pathogenesis of NK cell lymphomas.	2010	07	28	J Pathol	Chan	Ka-Kui
20439115	10.1016/j.molimm.2010.04.005	Interaction of calmodulin with Bcl10 modulates NF-kappaB activation.	Calcium signals resulting from antigen receptor activation are important in determining the responses of a T or B lymphocyte to an antigen. Calmodulin (CaM), a multi-functional sensor of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) signals in cells, is required in the pathway from the T cell receptor (TCR) to activation of the key transcription factor NF-kappaB. Here we searched for a partner in direct interaction with CaM in the pathway, and found that CaM interacts specifically with the signaling adaptor Bcl10. The binding is Ca(2+) dependent and of high affinity, with a K(d) of approximately 160 nM. Proximity of CaM and Bcl10 in vivo is induced by increases in the intracellular Ca(2+) level. The interaction is localized to the CARD domain of Bcl10, which interacts with the CARD domain of the upstream signaling partner Carma1. Binding of CaM to Bcl10 is shown to inhibit the ability of Bcl10 to interact with Carma1, an interaction that is required for signaling from the TCR to NF-kappaB. Furthermore, a mutant of Bcl10 with reduced binding to CaM shows increased activation of an NF-kappaB reporter, which is further enhanced by activating stimuli. We propose a novel mechanism whereby the Ca(2+) sensor CaM regulates T cell responses to antigens by binding to Bcl10, thereby modulating its interaction with Carma1 and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB.	2010	07	12	Mol Immunol	Edin	Sofia
20466000	10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.05.004	Lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB non-canonical pathway requires BCL10 serine 138 and NIK phosphorylations.	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL)-10 and reactive oxygen species mediate two pathways of NF-κB (RelA) activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human colonic epithelial cells. The pathway for LPS activation of RelB by the non-canonical pathway (RelB) in non-myeloid cells was not yet reported, but important for understanding the range of potential microbial LPS-induced effects in inflammatory bowel disease. Experiments were performed in human colonic epithelial cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in components of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalosome, in order to detect mediators of the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, including nuclear RelB and p52 and phospho- and total NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). BCL10 was silenced by siRNA and effects of mutations of specific phosphorylation sites of BCL10 (Ser138Gly and Ser218Gly) were determined. By the non-canonical pathway, LPS exposure increased nuclear RelB and p52, and phospho-NIK, with no change in total NIK. Phosphorylation of BCL10 serine 138 was required for NIK phosphorylation, since mutation of this residue eliminated the increases in phospho-NIK and nuclear RelB and p52. Mutations of either serine 138 or serine 218 reduced RelA, p50, and phospho-IκBα of the canonical pathway. Effects of LPS stimulation and BCL10 silencing on NIK phosphorylation were demonstrated in confocal images. LPS induces activation of both canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB in human colonic epithelial cells, and the non-canonical pathway requires phosphorylations of BCL10 (serine 138) and NIK. These findings demonstrate the important role of BCL10 in mediating LPS-induced inflammation in human colonic epithelial cells and may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions.	2010	11	10	Exp Cell Res	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
20507572	10.1186/1471-2172-11-26	Differential cytokine regulation by NF-kappaB and AP-1 in Jurkat T-cells.	Activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB largely control T-cell activation, following binding of foreign antigens to the T-cell receptor leading to cytokine secretion. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, in IL-6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T-cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia. coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NF-kappaB activity without affecting AP-1. The cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli. AP-1 activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter. In contrast, NF-kappaB responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of NF-kappaB by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced NF-kappaB activity following induction with HK E. coli. In order to further study NF-kappaB activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, PKC and Bcl10. Phosphorylated-PKC levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while Bcl10 levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment. Using an NF-kappaB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL-6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of JNK-inhibitor suppressed both CXCL8 and IL-6 while PKC-inhibitor primarily decreased CXCL8 expression. The present study shows that NF-kappaB regulated IL-6 but not CXCL8. This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.	2010	09	09	BMC Immunol	Khalaf	Hazem
20516126	10.1101/cshperspect.a000109	Oncogenic activation of NF-kappaB.	Recent genetic evidence has established a pathogenetic role for NF-kappaB signaling in cancer. NF-kappaB signaling is engaged transiently when normal B lymphocytes respond to antigens, but lymphomas derived from these cells accumulate genetic lesions that constitutively activate NF-kappaB signaling. Many genetic aberrations in lymphomas alter CARD11, MALT1, or BCL10, which constitute a signaling complex that is intermediate between the B-cell receptor and IkappaB kinase. The activated B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma activates NF-kappaB by a variety of mechanisms including oncogenic mutations in CARD11 and a chronic active form of B-cell receptor signaling. Normal plasma cells activate NF-kappaB in response to ligands in the bone marrow microenvironment, but their malignant counterpart, multiple myeloma, sustains a variety of genetic hits that stabilize the kinase NIK, leading to constitutive activation of the classical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways. Various oncogenic abnormalities in epithelial cancers, including mutant K-ras, engage unconventional IkappaB kinases to activate NF-kappaB. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB signaling in each of these cancer types induces apoptosis, providing a rationale for the development of NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.	2010	09	08	Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol	Staudt	Louis M
20520640	10.1038/leu.2010.118	Differential expression of NF-kappaB target genes in MALT lymphoma with and without chromosome translocation: insights into molecular mechanism.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is characterized by t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH and t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, which commonly activate the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway. Gastric MALT lymphomas harboring such translocations usually do not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication, while most of those without translocation can be cured by antibiotics. To understand the molecular mechanism of these different MALT lymphoma subgroups, we performed gene expression profiling analysis of 21 MALT lymphomas (13 translocation-positive, 8 translocation-negative). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the NF-kappaB target genes and 4394 additional gene sets covering various cellular pathways, biological processes and molecular functions have shown that translocation-positive MALT lymphomas are characterized by an enhanced expression of NF-kappaB target genes, particularly toll like receptor (TLR)6, chemokine, CC motif, receptor (CCR)2, cluster of differentiation (CD)69 and B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL)2, while translocation-negative cases were featured by active inflammatory and immune responses, such as interleukin-8, CD86, CD28 and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS). Separate analyses of the genes differentially expressed between translocation-positive and -negative cases and measurement of gene ontology term in these differentially expressed genes by hypergeometric test reinforced the above findings by GSEA. Finally, expression of TLR6, in the presence of TLR2, enhanced both API2-MALT1 and BCL10-mediated NF-kappaB activation in vitro. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of MALT lymphomas with and without translocation, potentially explaining their different clinical behaviors.	2010	09	14	Leukemia	Hamoudi	R A
20538615	10.1074/jbc.M110.131300	CARD9 mediates dectin-2-induced IkappaBalpha kinase ubiquitination leading to activation of NF-kappaB in response to stimulation by the hyphal form of Candida albicans.	The scaffold protein CARD9 plays an essential role in anti-fungus immunity and is implicated in mediating Dectin-1/Syk-induced NF-kappaB activation in response to Candida albicans infection. However, the molecular mechanism by which CARD9 mediates C. albicans-induced NF-kappaB activation is not fully characterized. Here we demonstrate that CARD9 is involved in mediating NF-kappaB activation induced by the hyphal form of C. albicans hyphae (Hyphae) but not by its heat-inactivated unicellular form. Our data show that inhibiting Dectin-2 expression selectively blocked Hyphae-induced NF-kappaB, whereas inhibiting Dectin-1 mainly suppressed zymosan-induced NF-kappaB, indicating that Hyphae-induced NF-kappaB activation is mainly through Dectin-2 and not Dectin-1. Consistently, we find that the hyphae stimulation induces CARD9 association with Bcl10, an adaptor protein that functions downstream of CARD9 and is also involved in C. albicans-induced NF-kappaB activation. This association is dependent on Dectin-2 but not Dectin-1 following the hyphae stimulation. Finally, we find that although both CARD9 and Syk are required for Hyphae-induced NF-kappaB activation, they regulate different signaling events in which CARD9 mediates IkappaBalpha kinase ubiquitination, whereas Syk regulates IkappaBalpha kinase phosphorylation. Together, our data demonstrated that CARD9 is selectively involved in Dectin-2-induced NF-kappaB activation in response to C. albicans hyphae challenging.	2010	09	30	J Biol Chem	Bi	Liangkuan
20551178	10.1242/jcs.069476	Interplay between BCL10, MALT1 and IkappaBalpha during T-cell-receptor-mediated NFkappaB activation.	T-cell-receptor (TCR) signalling to NFkappaB requires the assembly of a large multiprotein complex containing the serine/threonine kinase CK1alpha, the scaffold protein CARMA1, the heterodimer BCL10-MALT1 (the CBM complex) and the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK). Although the mechanisms regulating recruitment and activation of IKK within the CBM microenvironment have been extensively studied, there is little understanding of how IKK subsequently binds and phosphorylates IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NFkappaB, to promote IkappaBalpha ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that BCL10, MALT1 and IKK inducibly associate with IkappaBalpha in a complex that is physically distinct from the early CK1alpha-CBM signalosome. This IkappaBalpha-containing complex probably maturates from the CBM, because siRNA-based knockdown of CARMA1, CK1alpha and BCL10 hampered its assembly, leading to a reduction in NFkappaB activation. By contrast, CK1alpha normally recruited both BCL10 and ubiquitylated species of MALT1 when IkappaBalpha levels were reduced. However, knockdown of IkappaBalpha led to an altered ubiquitylation profile of BCL10-MALT1 combined with a defect in MALT1 reorganisation within large cytoplasmic structures, suggesting that, following stimulation, IkappaBalpha might also participate in MALT1 recycling. Altogether, our data suggest a two-step mechanism to connect active IKK to IkappaBalpha, and further unveil a potential role for IkappaBalpha in resetting TCR-mediated signalling.	2010	11	26	J Cell Sci	Carvalho	Gabrielle
20605784	10.1074/jbc.C110.109421	The CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome promotes angiotensin II-dependent vascular inflammation and atherogenesis.	The CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins together constitute a signaling complex (CBM signalosome) that mediates antigen-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in lymphocytes, thereby representing a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response. Although CARMA1 is restricted to cells of the immune system, the analogous CARMA3 protein has a much wider expression pattern. Emerging evidence suggests that CARMA3 can substitute for CARMA1 in non-immune cells to assemble a CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome and mediate G protein-coupled receptor activation of NF-kappaB. Here we show that one G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 receptor for angiotensin II, utilizes this mechanism for activation of NF-kappaB in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inducing pro-inflammatory signals within the vasculature, a key factor in atherogenesis. Further, we demonstrate that Bcl10-deficient mice are protected from developing angiotensin-dependent atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. By uncovering a novel vascular role for the CBM signalosome, these findings illustrate that CBM-dependent signaling has functions outside the realm of adaptive immunity and impacts pathobiology more broadly than previously known.	2010	09	30	J Biol Chem	McAllister-Lucas	Linda M
20679053		[Orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas. Clinico-pathological correlation in 25 cases].	Clinical, histological features and outcome of a cohort of patients with orbital and adnexal lymphoproliferative tumors were evaluated. Twenty-five cases in an oncologic referral center from 1995 to 2008, were included in the study. Each case had detailed immunophenotypic analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CD45, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, BCL10, Ki67, CD30, CD15, BCL1, Kappa, Lambda, CD138). Lesions were classified by using WHO (2008) lymphomas classification. Twenty-three patients were found to have primary and two secondary lymphomas. Histological subtypes were: 16 patients with marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, four diffuse large B cell lymphomas, two mantle cell lymphomas, two follicular lymphomas, and one Hodgkin lymphoma. Among the 25 patients studied, 22 had localized stage. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma was the most frequent type of primary orbital and adnexal lymphoma. In this study localized disease was observed in most cases, and distant spread of the lymphomas was infrequent.	2011	10	18	Medicina (B Aires)	Rojas Bilbao	Erica A

The signaling pathway controlling antigen receptor-induced regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a key role in lymphocyte activation and development and the generation of lymphomas. Work of the past decade has led to dramatic progress in the identification and characterization of new players in the pathway. Moreover, novel enzymatic activities relevant for this pathway have been discovered, which represent interesting drug targets for immuno-suppression or lymphoma treatment. Here, we summarize these findings and give an outlook on interesting open issues that need to be addressed in the future.	2011	01	05	Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol	Thome	Margot
20799731	10.1021/bi101052d	Oncogenic CARD11 mutations induce hyperactive signaling by disrupting autoinhibition by the PKC-responsive inhibitory domain.	The regulated activation of NF-κB by antigen receptor signaling is required for normal B and T lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. Dysregulated NF-κB activation is associated with several types of lymphoma, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). During normal antigen receptor signaling, the multidomain scaffold protein CARD11 undergoes a transition from a closed, inactive state to an open, active conformation that recruits several signaling proteins into a complex, leading to IKK kinase activation. This transition is regulated by the CARD11 inhibitory domain (ID), which participates in intramolecular interactions that prevent cofactor binding to CARD11 prior to signaling, but which is neutralized after receptor engagement by phosphorylation. Several oncogenic CARD11 mutations have been identified in DLBCL that enhance activity and that are mostly found in the coiled-coil domain. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations cause CARD11 hyperactivity and spontaneous NF-κB activation are poorly understood. In this report, we provide several lines of evidence that oncogenic mutations F123I and L225LI induce CARD11 hyperactivity by disrupting autoinhibition by the CARD11 ID. These mutations disrupt ID-mediated intramolecular interactions and ID-dependent inhibition and bypass the requirement for ID phosphorylation during T cell receptor signaling. Intriguingly, these mutations selectively enhance the apparent affinity of CARD11 for Bcl10, but not for other signaling proteins that are recruited to CARD11 in an ID-dependent manner during normal antigen receptor signaling. Our results establish a mechanism that explains how DLBCL-associated mutations in CARD11 can initiate spontaneous, receptor-independent activation of NF-κB.	2010	10	22	Biochemistry	Lamason	Rebecca L
20937806	10.1074/jbc.M110.159681	Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced inflammation is increased but apoptosis is inhibited by common food additive carrageenan.	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a homotrimeric, pleiotropic cytokine, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-α mediates both apoptosis and inflammation, stimulating an inflammatory cascade through the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, leading to increased nuclear RelB and p52. In contrast, the common food additive carrageenan (CGN) stimulates inflammation through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB activation and utilizes the adaptor molecule BCL10 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10). In a series of experiments, colonic epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TNF-α and carrageenan in order to simulate the possible effects of exposure to dietary CGN in the setting of a TNF-α-mediated inflammatory disease process. A marked increase in secretion of IL-8 occurred, attributable to synergistic effects on phosphorylated NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the non-canonical pathway. TNF-α induced the ubiquitination of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), which interacts with NIK, and CGN induced phosphorylation of BCL10, leading to increased NIK phosphorylation. These results suggest that TNF-α and CGN in combination act to increase NIK phosphorylation, thereby increasing activation of the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. In contrast, the apoptotic effects of TNF-α, including activation of caspase-8 and PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) fragmentation, were markedly reduced in the presence of CGN, and CGN caused reduced expression of Fas. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CGN drives TNF-α-stimulated cells toward inflammation rather than toward apoptotic cell death and suggest that CGN exposure may compromise the effectiveness of anti-TNF-α therapy.	2011	01	10	J Biol Chem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
21041303	10.1074/jbc.M110.158949	Thrombin-dependent NF-{kappa}B activation and monocyte/endothelial adhesion are mediated by the CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome.	Thrombin is a potent modulator of endothelial function and, through stimulation of NF-κB, induces endothelial expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). These cell surface adhesion molecules recruit inflammatory cells to the vessel wall and thereby participate in the development of atherosclerosis, which is increasingly recognized as an inflammatory condition. The principal receptor for thrombin on endothelial cells is protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Although it is known that PAR-1 signaling to NF-κB depends on initial PKC activation, the subsequent steps leading to stimulation of the canonical NF-κB machinery have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a complex of proteins containing CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1 links PAR-1 activation to stimulation of the IκB kinase complex. IκB kinase in turn phosphorylates IκB, leading to its degradation and the release of active NF-κB. Further, we find that although this CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome shares features with a CARMA1-containing signalosome found in lymphocytes, there are significant differences in how the signalosomes communicate with their cognate receptors. Specifically, whereas the CARMA1-containing lymphocyte complex relies on 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 for assembly and activation, the CARMA3-containing endothelial signalosome functions completely independent of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and instead relies on β-arrestin 2 for assembly. Finally, we show that thrombin-dependent adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells requires an intact endothelial CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome, underscoring the importance of the signalosome in mediating one of the most significant pro-atherogenic effects of thrombin.	2011	02	09	J Biol Chem	Delekta	Phillip C
21084243	10.1684/bdc.2010.1214	[Molecular abnormalities in lymphomas].	Numerous molecular abnormalities have been described in lymphomas. They are of diagnostic and prognostic value and are taken into account for the WHO classification of these tumors. They also shed some light on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in lymphomas. Overall, four types of molecular abnormalities are involved: mutations, translocations, amplifications and deletions of tumor suppressor genes. Several techniques are available to detect these molecular anomalies: conventional cytogenetic analysis, multicolor FISH, CGH array or gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays. In some lymphomas, genetic abnormalities are responsible for the expression of an abnormal protein (e.g. tyrosine-kinase, transcription factor) detectable by immunohistochemistry. In the present review, molecular abnormalities observed in the most frequent B, T or NK cell lymphomas are discussed. In the broad spectrum of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas microarray analysis shows mostly two subgroups of tumors, one with gene expression signature corresponding to germinal center B-cell-like (GCB: CD10+, BCL6 [B-Cell Lymphoma 6]+, centerine+, MUM1-) and a subgroup expressing an activated B-cell-like signature (ABC: CD10-, BCL6-, centerine-, MUM1+). Among other B-cell lymphomas with well characterized molecular abnormalies are follicular lymphoma (BCL2 deregulation), MALT lymphoma (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) [API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-lymphoma-translocation-gene1) fusion protein or deregulation BCL10, MALT1, FOXP1. MALT1 transcription factors], mantle cell lymphoma (cycline D1 [CCND1] overexpression) and Burkitt lymphoma (c-Myc expression). Except for ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, well characterized molecular anomalies are rare in lymphomas developed from T or NK cells. Peripheral T cell lymphomas not otherwise specified are a heterogeneous group of tumors with frequent but not recurrent molecular abnormalities. Gene profiling analysis shows that the expression of several genes is deregulated including PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) gene, encoding a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. In angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphomas molecular abnormalities are found in follicular helper T-cell (TFH) that express some distinctive markers such as CD10, PD-1, CXCR5 and the CXCL13 chemokine. ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a paradigme of T-cell lymphoma since it is associated with an X-ALK oncogenic fusion protein due to a translocation involving ALK gene at 2p23. ALK tyrosine kinase activates downstream pathways (Stat3/5b, Src kinases, PLCγ, PI3 kinase) implicated in lymphomagenesis, proliferation and protection against apoptosis. Specific ALK inhibitors are currently in clinical evaluation. Lastly several lymphomas are associated with infectious agents that play a direct (EB virus, HTLV1) or indirect role (e.g. Helicobacter pylori in MALT lymphoma) in lymphomagenesis.	2010	12	22	Bull Cancer	Delsol	G
22282688	10.2147/JBM.S9772	L-CBM signaling in lymphocyte development and function.	The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a central role in the activation and survival of lymphocytes. NF-κB, therefore, is pivotal for acquired immunity, but the dysregulation of NF-κB signaling leads to inflammatory diseases and lymphomagenesis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma-related molecules, B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and MALT-lymphoma-translocation gene1 (MALT1), are essential signaling components for NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, mediated by the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. CARMA1 (also referred to as CARD11 and Bimp3) is a crucial regulator for ITAM-mediated signaling as it forms a complex with BCL10-MALT1 in lymphoid lineage cells such as T, B, natural killer (NK), and natural killer T (NKT) cells, known as the lymphoid CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (L-CBM) complex. In this review, recent understanding of the molecular and biological functions and the signal regulation mechanisms of the L-CBM complex are described and its role in disease development and potential as a therapeutic target is further discussed.	2012	08	23	J Blood Med	Hara	Hiromitsu
18775860	10.1167/iovs.08-2539	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma in the ocular region: clinical, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetical characteristics.	To evaluate clinical, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetical characteristics of 116 patients with a diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) presenting primarily in the ocular region. Specimens from all patients with a diagnosis of ophthalmic lymphoma in Denmark during the period 1980 to 2005 were reviewed and reclassified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Cases reclassified as EMZL were selected and reviewed with respect to clinical characteristics and outcome. The presence of translocations involving IGH and/or MALT1 was investigated in 42 specimens by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Median age was 69 years. Most lymphomas were located in the orbit. Approximately one fourth of the patients had disseminated disease at presentation. One third experienced a relapse or progression of disease after initial therapy, and relapses were frequently found at extraocular sites. Five-year progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were 71% and 75%, respectively. Translocations involving the IGH- or MALT1-gene loci were detected in 2 (5%) of 42 specimens. In Cox regression multivariate analysis, IGH-translocation was the only factor associated with PFS, whereas a favorable International Prognostic Index (IPI) score was the most reliable predictor of OS. EMZL presenting in the ocular region usually runs an indolent course, but relapses are frequently seen. The IPI-score was the most reliable independent parameter for estimating risk of death in our cohort of patients. Furthermore, we found that the frequency of translocations involving the MALT1- and IGH-gene loci is low in ocular region EMZL.	2009	02	06	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	Sjö	Lene D
18952491	10.1016/j.oraloncology.2008.08.003	Expression of BCL10 is significantly associated with the progression and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas in Taiwan.	This study used an immunohistochemical technique to examine the expression of BCL10 in 93 specimens of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 21 specimens of normal oral mucosa (NOM). We found a significant correlation between the higher mean BCL10 labeling index (LI) and OSCCs at the tongue, with larger tumor size, with positive lymph node metastasis, with more advanced clinical stages, or with recurrence (all p-values=0.000). Positive lymph node metastasis (p=0.044) and BCL10 LI&gt;50% (p=0.037) were identified as independent unfavorable prognosis factors by multivariate analyses with Cox regression model. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that OSCC patients with a BCL10 LI&gt;50% had a significantly poorer cumulative survival than those with a BCL10 LI&lt;50% (log-rank test, p&lt;0.00001). We conclude that the BCL10 LI in OSCC samples can predict the progression of OSCCs and the survival of OSCC patients.	2010	12	02	Oral Oncol	Chang	Hao-Hueng
19066953	10.1007/s00428-008-0710-x	The monoclonal anti-BCL10 antibody (clone 331.1) is a sensitive and specific marker of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatic metaplasia.	Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pancreatic cancer which may be difficult to distinguish from other solid nonadenocarcinoma tumors. The diagnosis depends on the demonstration of acinar differentiation, obtained with antibodies recognizing various pancreatic enzymes that, although specific, show different sensitivity. The C-terminal portion of the BCL10 protein shows homology with carboxyl ester hydrolase (CEH), an enzyme produced by pancreatic acinar cells. We investigated the usefulness of a C-terminal BCL10 monoclonal antibody in the diagnosis of ACCs. We examined normal pancreases and different pancreatic tumors including ACCs, mixed acinar-endocrine carcinomas, ductal adenocarcinomas, mucinous, serous, solid pseudopapillary, and endocrine neoplasms. In addition, various normal tissues and cases of pancreatic metaplasia of the gastroesophageal mucosa, cases of ectopic pancreas, gastrointestinal endocrine tumors, salivary and breast acinic cell carcinomas, gastric adenocarcinomas with and without acinar differentiation, and hepatocellular carcinomas were studied. BCL10 immunoreactivity paralleled that of CEH and was restricted to acinar cells of normal and ectopic pancreas, of pancreatic metaplasia, and of ACCs. The anti-BCL10 antibody was more sensitive in detecting ACCs and pancreatic metaplasia than antibodies directed against other pancreatic enzymes. We suggest using BCL10 antibody for diagnosing pancreatic tumors and whenever an acinar differentiation is suspected in gastrointestinal neoplastic and metaplastic lesions.	2009	08	03	Virchows Arch	La Rosa	Stefano
19085995	10.1002/ibd.20821	ROS, Hsp27, and IKKbeta mediate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) activation of IkappaBa, NFkappaB, and IL-8.	Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) is a sulfated polysaccharide that has been very widely used to induce inflammation in experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease in which the effects of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are tested. However, the precise mechanisms by which DSS induces inflammation have not been elucidated. DSS-induced increases in phospho-IkappaBalpha, nuclear NFkappaB (p65), and IL-8 secretion in human colonic epithelial cells in tissue culture are attributable to a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced pathway of inflammation, and do not require TLR4, MyD88, or Bcl10, which are associated with the innate immune pathway of NFkappaB-IL-8 activation. DSS-induced increases were inhibited by the ROS scavengers Tempol and Tiron, were associated with decreased phosphorylation of MAPK12 (p38gamma), MAPK 13 (p38delta), and Hsp27, and required the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalosome component IKKbeta. In ex vivo colonic tissue from TLR4-deficient mice, or following knockdown of MyD88 or Bcl10 or exposure to an IRAK 1/4 inhibitor, DSS effects were not suppressed. Data demonstrated that DSS activates IkappaBalpha, NFkappaB, and IL-8 through an ROS-Hsp27-IKKbeta-mediated pathway, and not through an innate immune cascade. These results suggest that DSS models of inflammation may not be optimal for evaluation of interventions that involve mechanisms of innate immunity.	2009	08	11	Inflamm Bowel Dis	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
19112107	10.1074/jbc.C800207200	CXCL8/IL8 stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and the autocrine activation of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells by activating NFkappaB through the CBM (Carma3/Bcl10/Malt1) complex.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogen and permeability factor for endothelial cells that plays a central role in angiogenesis, vascular maintenance, inflammation, and cancer. VEGF also mediates the homeostatic adaptation to hypoxic conditions by promoting an increase in vascular density to compensate for decreased oxygenation. This process is triggered by an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1alpha), which becomes active in hypoxic tissues, leading to the synthesis and secretion of VEGF. The role of HIF1alpha in other processes that involve angiogenesis such as in inflammation is less clear. Of interest, endothelial cells not only respond to but also store and secrete VEGF, which is required for the maintenance of the integrity of the vascular system. How this intracellular pool of VEGF is regulated is still not understood. Here, we found that CXCL8/IL8, a potent proangiogenic and inflammatory chemokine, up-regulates VEGF mRNA and protein levels in endothelial cells by acting on its cognate receptor, CXCR2, and that this results in the autocrine activation of VEGFR2. Surprisingly, this process does not involve HIF1alpha but instead requires the activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB. Furthermore, we identified the components of the CBM complex, Carma3, Bcl10, and Malt1, as key mediators of the CXCL8/IL8-induced NFkappaB activation and VEGF up-regulation. Together, these findings support the existence of an NFkappaB-mediated pathway by which the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL8/IL8 controls the expression of VEGF in endothelial cells, thereby promoting the activation of VEGF receptors in an autocrine fashion.	2009	04	27	J Biol Chem	Martin	Daniel
19118383	10.1038/nature07613	Casein kinase 1alpha governs antigen-receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation and human lymphoma cell survival.	The transcription factor NF-kappaB is required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as the survival of certain lymphoma types. Antigen receptor stimulation assembles an NF-kappaB activating platform containing the scaffold protein CARMA1 (also called CARD11), the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (the CBM complex), linked to the inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase complex, but signal transduction is not fully understood. We conducted parallel screens involving a mass spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 binding partners and an RNA interference screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent 'activated B-cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here we report that both screens identified casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappaB. CK1alpha dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T-cell-receptor (TCR) engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation. However, CK1alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of CARMA1. CK1alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappaB. ABC DLBCL cells required CK1alpha for constitutive NF-kappaB activity, indicating that CK1alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene-a member of a new class of potential cancer therapeutic targets.	2009	04	21	Nature	Bidère	Nicolas
19124758	10.4049/jimmunol.182.2.1146	Differential use of CARD9 by dectin-1 in macrophages and dendritic cells.	The pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and Dectin-1 play key roles in coordinating the responses of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) to fungi. Induction of proinflammatory cytokines is instructed by signals from both TLR2 and Dectin-1. A recent report identified a role for CARD9 in innate anti-fungal responses, demonstrating CARD9-Bcl10-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and proinflammatory cytokine induction in murine bone marrow-derived DC stimulated via Dectin-1. We now report that Dectin-1-CARD9 signals fail to activate NF-kappaB and drive TNF-alpha induction in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. However, priming of bone marrow-derived macrophages with GM-CSF or IFN-gamma permits Dectin-1-CARD9-mediated TNF-alpha induction. Analysis of other macrophage/DC populations revealed further variation in the ability of Dectin-1-CARD9 signaling to drive TNF-alpha production. Resident peritoneal cells and alveolar macrophages produce TNF-alpha upon Dectin-1 ligation, while thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages and Flt3L-derived DC do not. We present data demonstrating that CARD9 is recruited to phagosomes via its CARD domain where it enhances TLR-induced cytokine production even in cells in which Dectin-1 is insufficient to drive cytokine production. In such cells, Dectin-1, CARD9, and Bcl10 levels are not limiting, and data indicate that these cells express additional factors that restrict Dectin-1-CARD9 signaling for TNF-alpha induction.	2009	02	19	J Immunol	Goodridge	Helen S
19136564	10.1074/jbc.M806650200	Phospholipase Cgamma2 is critical for Dectin-1-mediated Ca2+ flux and cytokine production in dendritic cells.	Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin that recognizes beta-glucan in the cell walls of fungi and plays an important role in anti-fungal immunity. It signals via tyrosine kinase Syk and adaptor protein Card9 to activate NF-kappaB leading to proinflammatory cytokine production in dendritic cells (DCs). Other than this, not much else is known of the mechanism of Dectin-1 signaling. We demonstrate here that stimulation of DCs with zymosan triggers an intracellular Ca2+ flux that can be attenuated by a blocking anti-Dectin-1 antibody or by pre-treatment of cells with the phospholipase C (PLC) gamma-inhibitor U73122, suggesting that Dectin-1 signals via a PLCgamma pathway to induce Ca2+ flux in DCs. Interestingly, treatment of DCs with particulate curdlan, which specifically engages Dectin-1, results in the phosphorylation of both PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2. However, we show that PLCgamma2 is the critical enzyme for Dectin-1 signaling in DCs. PLCgamma2-deficient DCs have drastic impairment of Ca2+ signaling and are defective in their secretion of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. PLCgamma2-deficient DCs also exhibit impaired activation of ERK and JNK MAPKs and AP-1 and NFAT transcription factors in response to Dectin-1 stimulation. In addition, PLCgamma2-deficient DCs are also impaired in their activation of NF-kappaB upon Dectin-1 engagement due to defective assembly of the Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 complex and impaired IKKalpha/beta activation and IkappaBalpha degradation. Thus, our data indicate that pattern recognition receptors such as Dectin-1 could elicit Ca2+ signaling and that PLCgamma2 is a critical player in the Dectin-1 signal transduction pathway.	2009	05	04	J Biol Chem	Xu	Shengli
19139169	10.1084/jem.20081445	Adjuvanticity of a synthetic cord factor analogue for subunit Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccination requires FcRgamma-Syk-Card9-dependent innate immune activation.	Novel vaccination strategies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are urgently needed. The use of recombinant MTB antigens as subunit vaccines is a promising approach, but requires adjuvants that activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for elicitation of protective immunity. The mycobacterial cord factor Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM) and its synthetic analogue Trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB) are effective adjuvants in combination with MTB subunit vaccine candidates in mice. However, it is unknown which signaling pathways they engage in APCs and how these pathways are coupled to the adaptive immune response. Here, we demonstrate that these glycolipids activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) via Syk-Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 signaling to induce a specific innate activation program distinct from the response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. APC activation by TDB and TDM was independent of the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1, but required the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing adaptor protein Fc receptor gamma chain (FcRgamma). In vivo, TDB and TDM adjuvant activity induced robust combined T helper (Th)-1 and Th-17 T cell responses to a MTB subunit vaccine and partial protection against MTB challenge in a Card9-dependent manner. These data provide a molecular basis for the immunostimulatory activity of TDB and TDM and identify the Syk-Card9 pathway as a rational target for vaccine development against tuberculosis.	2009	02	23	J Exp Med	Werninghaus	Kerstin
19144384	10.1016/j.humpath.2008.06.032	BCL2, BCL6, MYC, MALT 1, and BCL10 rearrangements in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas: a multicenter evaluation of a new set of fluorescent in situ hybridization probes and correlation with clinical outcome.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although it is a curable disease, fewer than half of patients are cured with conventional chemotherapy. The highly variable outcome reflects a heterogeneous group of tumors, with different genetic abnormalities and responses to therapy. We analyzed 74 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization with commercially available probes for split-signal targeting BCL-2, BCL-6, MYC, BCL-10, and MALT-1. Gene rearrangements were identified in 48 (65%) of 74 cases. BCL-6 was the most rearranged gene (45%), followed by BCL-2 (21%), BCL-10 (18%), and MYC (16%). No MALT-1 rearrangements were found. When diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases were subdivided into germinal-center B-cell-like and activated B-cell-like groups, an inverse pattern of BCL-2 and BCL-6 rearrangements was observed. Of interest, the presence of chromosome rearrangements was associated with a worse prognosis. The pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities highlighted the fact not only that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous entity but also that even individual cases may contain subclones bearing different chromosomal rearrangements. The relevance and the clinical implication of minor clones showing gene rearrangements are poorly understood; however, this first observation suggests that different rearrangements may be involved in the progression of the disease. The fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis with the panel used in this study is useful to detect the heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and identify alterations with prognostic implications.	2009	06	05	Hum Pathol	Tibiletti	Maria Grazia
19279678	10.1371/journal.pone.0004822	Auto-ubiquitination-induced degradation of MALT1-API2 prevents BCL10 destabilization in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphoma.	The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) is the most frequent chromosomal aberration associated with MALT lymphoma and results in constitutive NF-kappaB activity via the expression of an API2-MALT1 fusion protein. The properties of the reciprocal MALT1-API2 were never investigated as it was reported to be rarely transcribed. Our data indicate the presence of MALT1-API2 transcripts in the majority of t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas. Based on the breakpoints in the MALT1 and API2 gene, the MALT1-API2 protein contains the death domain and one or both immunoglobulin-like domains of MALT1 (approximately 90% of cases)--mediating the possible interaction with BCL10--fused to the RING domain of API2. Here we show that this RING domain enables MALT1-API2 to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for BCL10, inducing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in vitro. Expression of MALT1-API2 transcripts in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas was however not associated with a reduction of BCL10 protein levels. As we observed MALT1-API2 to be an efficient target of its own E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, our data suggest that this inherent instability of MALT1-API2 prevents its accumulation and renders a potential effect on MALT lymphoma development via destabilization of BCL10 unlikely.	2009	05	04	PLoS One	Noels	Heidi

The events following triggering of antigen receptors and subsequent activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) need to be carefully controlled to prevent abnormal immune responses. BCL10 links the antigen receptor to NFkappaB. The aim of this study was to determine the expression pattern of BCL10 and NFkappaB in minor salivary gland infiltrates of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Minor salivary glands from patients with primary SS (n = 17) and sicca controls (n = 4) were evaluated by single and double immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for confocal microscopy. BCL10 and NFkappaB-p65 expression were evaluated in the infiltrating lymphocytes. Ectopic germinal centers (GCs) were investigated by CD21. Tonsil, lymph node and lymphoma tissue were used as positive controls. BCL10 nuclear positive cells were observed in focal lymphocytic infiltrates in the investigated minor salivary glands and were not restricted to patients with ectopic GCs. By double-staining, some of the BCL10 nuclear positive cells were identified as B cells. There was, however, no constitutive activation of NFkappaB as depicted by the exclusive cytoplasmic expression of p65 in the infiltrating lymphocytes in the pSS. Nuclear expression of BCL10 in infiltrating lymphocytes was a common occurrence in pSS minor salivary glands indicating it as a possible marker of autoimmune induced chronic inflammation. There was, however, no constitutive activation of NFkappaB.	2009	10	29	J Oral Pathol Med	Gatumu	Margaret K
19309400	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2009.03250.x	Bcl-10 protein highly correlates with the expression of phosphorylated p65 NF-kappaB in peripheral T-cell lymphomas and is associated with clinical outcome.	In T cells, protein kinase C (PKC) theta plays a major role in T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of a novel nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway that involves phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 (Pp65(Ser536)). Bcl-10 acts along the same pathway downstream of PKC theta to activate NF-kappaB. The aim was to investigate the relationship between the expression of PKC theta, Bcl-10 and P-p65(Ser536) proteins and their prognostic significance in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs). Paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 patients with PTCLs treated with curative intention were evaluated retrospectively. Expression of PKC theta, Bcl-10 and P-p65(Ser536) proteins was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Expression of PKC theta was detected in 22 of 30 cases (73%), Bcl-10 in 20 of 30 (67%) and P-p65(Ser536) in 21 of 30 (70%). Bcl-10+ tumours were associated with PKC theta (18 of 22) (P &lt; 0.0001) and Pp65Ser536 (19 of 21) expression (P &lt; 0.0001). Patients with Bcl-10+ or P-p65(Ser536+) tumours fared better, with a 5-year overall survival of 48 and 45%, respectively, versus 0% for negative tumours (P = 0.029 and P = 0.04, respectively). Bcl-10 is expressed in PTCLs, correlates with PKC theta and Pp65(Ser536) expression and seems to be associated with better survival.	2009	06	15	Histopathology	Briones	Javier

Chromosomal translocations are the hallmark genetic aberration in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with specific translocations often selectively associated with specific NHL subtypes. Because many NHL-associated translocations involve cell cycle, apoptosis, and lymphocyte development regulatory genes, we evaluated NHL risk associated with common genetic variation in 20 candidate genes in these pathways. Genotyping of 203 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was conducted in 1,946 NHL cases and 1,808 controls pooled from 3 independent population-based case-control studies. We used logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NHL and four major NHL subtypes in relation to tag SNP genotypes and haplotypes. We observed the most striking associations for tag SNPs in the proapoptotic gene BCL2L11 (BIM) and BCL7A, which is involved in a rare NHL-associated translocation. Variants in BCL2L11 were strongly related to follicular lymphoma only, particularly rs3789068 (OR(AG), 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.81; OR(GG), 1.65; 95% CI, 1.25-2.19; P(trend) = 0.0004). Variants in BCL7A were strongly related to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma only, particularly rs1880030 (OR(AG), 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08-1.68; OR(AA), 1.60; 95% CI, 1.22-2.08; P(trend) = 0.0004). The associations for both variants were similar in all three studies and supported by haplotype analyses. We also observed notable associations for variants in BCL6, CCND1, and MYC. Our results support the role of common genetic variation in cell cycle, apoptosis, and lymphocyte development regulatory genes in lymphomagenesis, and suggest that effects may vary by NHL subtype. Replication of our findings and further study to identify functional SNPs are warranted.	2009	06	16	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Morton	Lindsay M
19359218	10.1016/j.it.2009.03.002	CARD9 versus CARMA1 in innate and adaptive immunity.	Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated upon engagement of a wide variety of immunoreceptors. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT1) are essential signaling components for NF-kappaB and MAPK activation mediated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors in both adaptive and innate immunity. Recent studies have revealed that two caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) family adaptor molecules, CARD-containing MAGUK protein 1 (CARMA1) and CARD9, are crucial regulators of the ITAM-mediated signaling pathway by forming a complex with BCL10-MALT1 in lymphoid and myeloid cells, respectively. Here, we describe the immune responses and the cell-type-specific regulation mechanisms for NF-kappaB and MAPK activation controlled by CARMA1 and CARD9 through innate and adaptive immunoreceptors.	2009	07	23	Trends Immunol	Hara	Hiromitsu
19366357	10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00805.x	Protein-protein interactions: a simple strategy to identify binding sites and peptide antagonists.	Secondary structure motifs and small protein domains can act as building blocks that are isolated and investigated to gain insights into protein global structure but can also modulate interactions with external partners. Most progress has been made in this field using synthetic peptides. Fragmentation of folded proteins by proteolytic enzymes that act preferentially on exposed and less structured sites can help to isolate shorter polypeptides with preserved secondary and tertiary structures that mimic the original protein architecture. Such molecules can be used as probes for structural studies and as tools for in vitro assays to select active fragments useful as agonists or antagonists of the original protein or as scaffolds for the design of more potent and selective ligands. This simple but effective proteolytic methodology has been successfully applied to determine antagonists of protein-protein interactions, allowing the identification of inhibitors with high efficacy and specificity. Here, we present several studies including the complex between phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes and phospholipase 1, believed to play a relevant role in the insulin resistance mechanism in phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes-overexpressing tissues, the self-association of BCL10 caspase recruitment domain that mediates a protein oligomerization process responsible for NF-kappaB activation and the self-association of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible factor 45 beta, a major player of the endogenous NF-kappaB-mediated resistance to apoptosis.	2009	07	17	Chem Biol Drug Des	Sandomenico	Annamaria
19385974	10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01139.x	Antibodies to Helicobacter pylori and CagA protein are associated with the response to antibacterial therapy in patients with H. pylori-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric MALT lymphoma.	The aim of this study was to clarify predictive factors for response to eradication therapy in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Sixty-six patients who were examined for H. pylori infection and the presence of the API2-MALT1 chimeric transcript and who underwent H. pylori eradication therapy as first-line therapy, were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemical markers (p53, Ki-67, and BCL10), microsatellite instability, loss of heterozygosity, serum levels of antibodies (anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA), and markers for gastritis (gastrin and pepsinogens) were examined, and the results were compared between patients whose tumors regressed completely after eradication therapy (responders) and patients whose tumors did not regress (non-responders). Of the 66 patients with localized gastric MALT lymphoma, 47 (71.2%) showed complete remission after eradication therapy. None of the H. pylori-negative (n = 9) and/or API2-MALT1-positive (n = 7) patients responded to antibacterial treatment. Of 44 patients with H. pylori-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric MALT lymphoma, 38 (86.4%) showed complete remission after eradication therapy. Titers of antibodies against H. pylori and CagA protein were significantly higher in the responders than in the non-responders (P = 0.0235 and 0.0089, respectively). No significant difference between the groups was observed for the other factors. In conclusion, measurement of titers of serum antibodies to H. pylori and CagA protein may be useful for predicting the response to eradication therapy in patients with H. pylori-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric MALT lymphoma.	2009	07	08	Cancer Sci	Sumida	Tomonori
19428562	10.1016/j.imlet.2009.03.005	Barley-derived beta-D-glucan induces immunostimulation via a dectin-1-mediated pathway.	Barley-derived beta-glucan, a linear mixed-linkage beta-glucan composed of 1,3- and 1,4-beta-D-glucopyranose polymers, binds to dectin-1. However, whether it can trigger signal transduction via dectin-1 remains unclear. In this study, we used a reporter gene assay to determine whether barley-derived beta-d-glucan can activate NF-kappaB via dectin-1-mediated signaling when dectin-1 is cotransfected with Syk, CARD9, and Bcl10 in 293T cells. We found that barley-derived beta-D-glucan can activate NF-kappaB leading to cytokine production when dectin-1, Syk, CARD9, and Bcl10 are coexpressed in the cells. We also found that barley-derived beta-D-glucan can induce the phosphorylation of Syk and production of IL-6 in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. These results indicated that the immunostimulatory effects of barley-derived beta-d-glucan might be exerted, at least in part, via dectin-1.	2009	08	17	Immunol Lett	Tada	Rui
19444310	10.1038/embor.2009.64	COP9 signalosome controls the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex upon T-cell stimulation.	The Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex connects T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling to the canonical IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF (nuclear factor)-kappaB pathway. Earlier studies have indicated that the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a pleiotropic regulator of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system, controls antigen responses in T cells. The CSN is required for the degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha, but other molecular targets involved in T-cell signalling remained elusive. Here, we identify the CSN subunit 5 (CSN5) as a new interactor of Malt1 and Carma1. T-cell activation triggers the recruitment of the CSN to the CBM complex, and CSN downregulation impairs TCR-induced IKK activation. Furthermore, the CSN is required for maintaining the stability of Bcl10 in response to T-cell activation. Taken together, our data provide evidence for a functional link between the evolutionarily conserved CSN and the adaptive immunoregulatory CBM complex in T cells.	2009	08	13	EMBO Rep	Welteke	Verena
19454668	10.4049/jimmunol.0900498	CARMA1 controls an early checkpoint in the thymic development of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.	Natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) that develop in the thymus are essential to limit immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. However, the steps necessary for their thymic development are incompletely understood. The CARMA1/Bcl10/Malt1 (CBM) complex, comprised of adaptors that link the TCR to the transcription factor NF-kappaB, is required for development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) but not conventional T cells. Current models propose that TCR-NF-kappaB is needed in a Treg-extrinsic manner for IL-2 production by conventional T cells or in already precommitted Treg precursors for driving IL-2/STAT5 responsiveness and further maturation into Tregs and/or for promoting cell survival. Using CARMA1-knockout mice, our data show instead that the CBM complex is needed in a Treg-intrinsic rather than -extrinsic manner. Constitutive activity of STAT5 or protection from apoptosis by transgenic expression of Bcl2 in developing Tregs is not sufficient to rescue CARMA1-knockout Treg development. Instead, our results demonstrate that the CBM complex controls an early checkpoint in Treg development by enabling generation of thymic precursors of Tregs. These data suggest a modified model of nTreg development in which TCR-CBM-dependent signals are essential to commit immature thymocytes to the nTreg lineage.	2009	06	22	J Immunol	Molinero	Luciana L

19494296	10.4049/jimmunol.0803313	A20 negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling to NF-kappaB by cleaving Malt1 ubiquitin chains.	The Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 signaling module bridges TCR signaling to the canonical IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway. Covalent attachment of regulatory ubiquitin chains to Malt1 paracaspase directs TCR signaling to IKK activation. Further, the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 was recently suggested to suppress T cell activation, but molecular targets for A20 remain elusive. In this paper, we show that A20 regulates the strength and duration of the IKK/NF-kappaB response upon TCR/CD28 costimulation. By catalyzing the removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains from Malt1, A20 prevents sustained interaction between ubiquitinated Malt1 and the IKK complex and thus serves as a negative regulator of inducible IKK activity. Upon T cell stimulation, A20 is rapidly removed and paracaspase activity of Malt1 has been suggested to cleave A20. Using antagonistic peptides or reconstitution of Malt1(-/-) T cells, we show that Malt1 paracaspase activity is required for A20 cleavage and optimal IL-2 production, but dispensable for initial IKK/NF-kappaB signaling in CD4(+) T cells. However, proteasomal inhibition impairs A20 degradation and impedes TCR/CD28-induced IKK activation. Taken together, A20 functions as a Malt1 deubiquitinating enzyme and proteasomal degradation and de novo synthesis of A20 contributes to balance TCR/CD28-induced IKK/NF-kappaB signaling.	2009	06	25	J Immunol	Düwel	Michael
19535128	10.1016/j.humpath.2009.02.018	Primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the gallbladder: report of a case harboring API2/MALT1 gene fusion.	The genetic alterations underlying extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type are heterogeneous and show variation according to the tumor site. Here, we report a case of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the gallbladder with genetic characterization. This lymphoma, diagnosed in a 75-year-old woman who underwent cholecystectomy for suspected acute cholecystitis, presented as diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall. The morphology was typical of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and by immunophenotype, the tumor cells were CD20+ CD5- CD10- CD23- CD43- BCL6- BCL2+ IgM+ IgD- lambda+, with moderate nuclear expression of BCL10.

19538180	10.1042/BJ20090055	Generation and functional characterization of a BCL10-inhibitory peptide that represses NF-kappaB activation.	The molecular complex containing BCL10 and CARMA [CARD (caspase recruitment domain)-containing MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase)] proteins has recently been identified as a key component in the signal transduction pathways that regulate activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. Assembly of complexes containing BCL10 and CARMA proteins relies on homophilic interactions established between the CARDs of these proteins. In order to identify BCL10-inhibitory peptides, we have established a method of assaying peptides derived from the CARD of BCL10 in binding competition assays of CARD-CARD self-association. By this procedure, a short peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 91-98 of BCL10 has been selected as an effective inhibitor of protein self-association. When tested in cell assays for its capacity to block NF-kappaB activation, this peptide represses activation of NF-kappaB mediated by BCL10, CARMA3 and PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Collectively, these results indicate that residues 91-98 of BCL10 are involved in BCL10 self-association and also participate in the interaction with external partners. We also show that blocking of the CARD of BCL10 may potentially be used for the treatment of pathological conditions associated with inappropriate NF-kappaB activation.	2009	09	16	Biochem J	Marasco	Daniela

Familial aggregation, linkage and case-control studies support the role of germline genes in the aetiology of lymphoid malignancies. To further examine the role of genetic variation underlying susceptibility, we analysed 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 152 genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair, immune response and oxidative stress pathways among a unique sample of 165 unrelated familial cases including patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and 107 spouse controls. We confirmed previous studies showing a polymorphism in the IL10 promoter (rs1800890/-3575T&gt;A) to be associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as this allele was found to be associated with both CLL and WM. We also confirmed the role of IL6 variation to be associated with HL. Polymorphisms in TNFSF10 were associated with both CLL and WM. Future replication and functional studies are needed to clarify the role of these genetic variants. Finally, our data further support the close association of WM and CLL.	2009	09	10	Br J Haematol	Liang	Xueying Sharon
19576081		[A clinical study of chromosome translocations in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in Chinese patients].	To investigate the genetic aberrations in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas from different sites of the body in Chinese patients. Two hundred and seventeen paraffin-embedded MALT lymphoma specimens from 11 major sites were studied with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect t (11; 18) (q21; q21)/API2-MALT1, t (1; 14) (p22; q32)/IGH-BCL10, (14; 18) (q32; q21)/IGH-MALT1 and BCL6 gene involved chromosome translocations. These translocations were mutually exclusive and detected in 21% (46/217) of the cases, including t (11; 18) (q21; q21) API2-MALT1 13% (29/217), t (1; 14) (p22; q32) IGH-BCL10 in 1% (3/217), t (14; 18) (q32; q21) IGH-MALT1 1% (2/217), BCL6 involved translocation in 2% (4/217) and IGH-unknown translocation partner in 4% (8/217). t (11; 18) (q21; q21) API2-MALT1 was found with the highest frequency in MALT lymphoma from lungs (47%, 8/17) and small intestine (29%, 4/14), followed by salivary gland (17%, 1/6), stomach (14%, 12/84) and ocular adnexae (6%, 4/68). t (1; 14) (p22; q32) was only detected in lungs (12%, 2/17) and stomach (1%, 1/84). t (14; 18) (q32; q21) was mainly detected in lungs (6%, 1/17) and ocular adnexae (2%, 1/68). BCL6 gene involved translocation was detected in salivary gland (17%, 1/6) and stomach (4%, 3/84). It is demonstrated that the four translocations occur with markedly variable frequencies in MALT lymphoma of different sites in Chinese patients. The distributions of these chromosome translocations in Chinese patients are slightly different from those reported in western patients.	2009	10	01	Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi	Dong	Ge-Hong
19608748	10.1182/blood-2009-03-208215	Mice deficient for CD137 ligand are predisposed to develop germinal center-derived B-cell lymphoma.	In the germinal center (GC), B cells proliferate dramatically and diversify their immunoglobulin genes, which increases the risk of malignant transformation. The GC B-cell reaction relies on crosstalk with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), to which the costimulatory receptor CD137 on FDCs and its ligand on GC B cells potentially contribute. We report that mice deficient for CD137 ligand (CD137L) are predisposed to develop B-cell lymphoma, with an incidence of approximately 60% at 12 months of age. Lymphoma membrane markers were characteristic of GC B cells. Longitudinal histologic analysis identified the GC as site of oncogenic transformation and classified 85% of the malignancies found in approximately 200 mice as GC-derived B-cell lymphoma. To delineate the mechanism underlying lymphomagenesis, gene expression profiles of wild-type and CD137L-deficient GC B cells were compared. CD137L deficiency was associated with enhanced expression of a limited gene set that included Bcl-10 and the GC response regulators Bcl-6, Spi-B, Elf-1, Bach2, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Among these are proto-oncogenes that mediate GC B-cell lymphoma development in humans. We conclude that CD137L ordinarily regulates the GC B-cell response and thereby acts as a tumor suppressor.	2009	09	29	Blood	Middendorp	Sabine

Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are rare neoplasms. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these tumors. The BCL10 gene, a proapoptotic signaling molecule involved in the Apaf-1/caspase-9 cell death pathway, may act as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple types of tumors including testicular GCTs. To evaluate whether alterations in the BCL10 gene play a role in the genesis of intracranial GCTs, we analyzed the BCL10 gene in 10 pure germinomas (PGs) and 10 nongerminomatous GCTs. We found no inactivating mutations; however, 5 of 10 PGs and 1 of 10 nongerminomatous GCTs manifested specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that carried an amino acid substitution at codon 5 in exon 1 or codon 162 in exon 3. This SNP occurs at higher frequency in patients with PGs than healthy individuals (p = 0.07). CSF dissemination occurred in 4 of our 6 patients manifesting SNP (p = 0.037). Our data suggest that this specific SNP in the BCL10 gene may be partly responsible for the tumorigenesis of PG in Japanese individuals, and may be associated with the aggressive nature of these tumors.	2010	05	20	Pediatr Neurosurg	Hayashi	Yutaka
19696203	10.1182/blood-2008-12-192583	Emu-BCL10 mice exhibit constitutive activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways generating marginal zone (MZ) B-cell expansion as a precursor to splenic MZ lymphoma.	BCL10, required for nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation during antigen-driven lymphocyte responses, is aberrantly expressed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type marginal zone (MZ) lymphomas because of chromosomal translocations. Emu-driven human BCL10 transgenic (Tg) mice, which we created and characterize here, had expanded populations of MZ B cells and reduced follicular and B1a cells. Splenic B cells from Tg mice exhibited constitutive activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways is associated with increased expression of NF-kappaB target genes. These genes included Tnfsf13b, which encodes the B-cell activating factor (BAFF). In addition, levels of BAFF were significantly increased in sera from Tg mice. MZ B cells of Tg mice exhibited reduced turnover in vivo and enhanced survival in vitro, indicative of lymphoaccumulation rather than lymphoproliferation as the cause of MZ expansion. In vivo antibody responses to both T-independent, and especially T-dependent, antigens were significantly reduced in Tg mice. Mortality was accelerated in Tg animals, and some mice older than 8 months had histologic and molecular findings indicative of clonal splenic MZ lymphoma. These results suggest that, in addition to constitutive activation of BCL10 in MZ B cells, other genetic factors or environmental influences are required for short latency oncogenic transformation.	2009	12	03	Blood	Li	Zhaoyang
19709433	10.1186/1476-4598-8-67	STAT5 regulation of BCL10 parallels constitutive NFkappaB activation in lymphoid tumor cells.	Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 A and B (STAT5) are key survival factors in cells of the lymphoid lineage. Identification of novel, tissue-specific STAT5 regulated genes would advance the ability to combat diseases due to aberrant STAT5 signaling. In the present work a library of human STAT5 bound genomic elements was created and validated. Of several STAT5 responsive genomic regulatory elements identified, one was located within the first intron of the human BCL10 gene. Chromatin immuno-precipitation reactions confirmed constitutive in vivo STAT5 binding to this intronic fragment in various human lymphoid tumor cell lines. Interestingly, non-phosphorylated STAT5 was found in the nuclei of Kit225 and YT cells in the absence of cytokine stimulation that paralleled constitutive NFkappaB activation. Inhibition of the hyperactive JAK3/STAT5 pathway in MT-2 cells via the Mannich-base, NC1153, diminished the constitutive in vivo occupancy of BCL10-SBR by STAT5, reduced NFkappaB activity and BCL10 protein expression in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, depletion of STAT5 via selective antisense oligonucleotide treatment similarly resulted in decreased BCL10 mRNA and protein expression, cellular viability and impaired NFkappaB activity independent of IL-2. These results suggest that the NFkappaB regulator BCL10 is an IL-2-independent STAT5 target gene. These findings proffer a model in which un-activated STAT5 can regulate pathways critical for lymphoid cell survival and inhibitors that disrupt STAT5 function independent of tyrosine phosphorylation may be therapeutically effective in treating certain leukemias/lymphomas.	2010	02	17	Mol Cancer	Nagy	Zsuzsanna S
19773279	10.1136/oem.2008.044024	Association between genetic variants in VEGF, ERCC3 and occupational benzene haematotoxicity.	Benzene is an established human haematotoxin, with substantial interindividual variation in benzene-induced toxicity. To further examine if genetic variation contributes to benzene haematotoxicity, we analysed 1023 tagSNPs in 121 gene regions important for benzene metabolism, haematopoiesis, leukaemia and lymphoma among 250 workers exposed to benzene and 140 unexposed controls in a cross-sectional study carried out in China. Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and total white blood cell (WBC) count and its subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders and occupational exposure to benzene and toluene among exposed workers. The minp test assessed the association on the gene region level. The false discovery rate method was used to control for multiple comparisons. VEGF (minp = 0.0030) and ERCC3 (minp = 0.0042) were the most significantly associated gene regions with altered WBC counts among benzene-exposed workers, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Highly significant changes were also found for WBC subtype counts, including granulocytes, CD4+ T cells and lymphocytes for VEGF and granulocytes and NK cells for ERCC3. Further, in workers exposed to &lt;1 ppm, a SNP in VEGF was associated with changes in WBC and granulocyte counts, and SNPs in ERCC3 were associated with changes in WBC, NK cell and granulocyte counts. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in VEGF, which plays an important role in blood vessel growth, and ERCC3, which is a member of the DNA repair pathway and is responsible for repairing bulky DNA adducts formed by chemicals, may contribute to individual susceptibility to benzene-induced haematotoxicity at relatively low levels of benzene exposure.	2010	01	04	Occup Environ Med	Hosgood	H D
19841089	10.1084/jem.20091167	Inhibition of MALT1 protease activity is selectively toxic for activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of lymphoma in humans. The aggressive activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is characterized by constitutive NF-kappaB activity and requires signals from CARD11, BCL10, and the paracaspase MALT1 for survival. CARD11, BCL10, and MALT1 are scaffold proteins that normally associate upon antigen receptor ligation. Signal-induced CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complexes couple upstream events to IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB activation. MALT1 also possesses a recently recognized proteolytic activity that cleaves and inactivates the negative NF-kappaB regulator A20 and BCL10 upon antigen receptor ligation. Yet, the relevance of MALT1 proteolytic activity for malignant cell growth is unknown. Here, we demonstrate preassembled CBM complexes and constitutive proteolysis of the two known MALT1 substrates in ABC-DLBCL, but not in germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL. ABC-DLBCL cell treatment with a MALT1 protease inhibitor blocks A20 and BCL10 cleavage, reduces NF-kappaB activity, and decreases the expression of NF-kappaB targets genes. Finally, MALT1 paracaspase inhibition results in death and growth retardation selectively in ABC-DLBCL cells. Thus, our results indicate a growth-promoting role for MALT1 paracaspase activity in ABC-DLBCL and suggest that a pharmacological MALT1 protease inhibition could be a promising approach for lymphoma treatment.	2009	11	16	J Exp Med	Ferch	Uta
19860212		[Crucial roles of Helicobacter pylori infection in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma].	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative helical rod that colonizes human gastric mucosa. Its discovery has opened up new opportunities regarding the understating and management of gastrointestinal disorders. In humans, infection with H. pylori has been established as a major cause of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer, and is important in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Bacterial and host factors determine the outcome of H. pylori infection. The eradication of H. pylori can, therefore, contribute to the treatment and prevention of these diseases. H. pylori infection plays a critical role in gastric carcinogenesis through two major pathways: the indirect action of H. pylori on gastric epithelial cells through inflammation, and the direct action of the bacteria on epithelial cells through the induction of protein modulation and gene mutation. MALT lymphoma is a common low grade B-cell lymphoma arising from a background of chronic inflammatory disease at a number of mucosal sites. Those originating in the stomach are causatively linked to H. pylori infection, and eradication of the bacterium with antibiotics leads to the long-term complete regression of lymphoma. t (11;18)/API2-MALT1 and t(1;14)/IGH-BCL10 are specifically associated with the gastric MALT lymphoma entity, and the oncogenic products of these translocations have been shown to target a common molecular pathway, i.e., the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. This paper reviews recent advances in our understanding of the association of H. pylori infection with gastric cancer and gastric MALT lymphoma and the molecular genetics underlying tumor development.	2009	12	29	Rinsho Byori	Ota	Hiroyoshi
19897720	10.1073/pnas.0907511106	Essential role of MALT1 protease activity in activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	A key element for the development of suitable anti-cancer drugs is the identification of cancer-specific enzymatic activities that can be therapeutically targeted. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue transformation protein 1 (MALT1) is a proto-oncogene that contributes to tumorigenesis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype, the least curable subtype of DLBCL. Recent data suggest that MALT1 has proteolytic activity, but it is unknown whether this activity is relevant for tumor growth. Here we report that MALT1 is constitutively active in DLBCL lines of the ABC but not the GCB subtype. Inhibition of the MALT1 proteolytic activity led to reduced expression of growth factors and apoptosis inhibitors, and specifically affected the growth and survival of ABC DLBCL lines. These results demonstrate a key role for the proteolytic activity of MALT1 in DLBCL of the ABC subtype, and provide a rationale for the development of pharmacological inhibitors of MALT1 in DLBCL therapy.	2010	01	14	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Hailfinger	Stephan

In most H. pylori-positive patients, gastric low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas regress both endoscopically and histopathologically after H. pylori eradication, but no factors that can be predictive of the response to the eradication have been definitively identified, and there is little information on how to determine the optimal observation period before additional treatment can be started. Here, clinical studies dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of gastric MALT lymphomas and H. pylori published during the last 5 years were systematically reviewed, and studies identifying the molecular approaches involved in the pathogenesis were summarized. Most of the clinical studies indicate a favorable effect of H. pylori eradication on the clinical outcome of gastric MALT lymphomas. Some studies suggest the necessity of additional treatment in nonresponders to H. pylori eradication, while others suggest the adoption of a watch-and-wait strategy. The molecular characteristics of MALT lymphomas could play an important role in prognostic prediction and the selection of further therapeutic intervention after the eradication. This updated review of gastric MALT lymphomas illustrates the potential efficacy of H. pylori eradication in tumor remission, but further molecular characterization is necessary to establish the most suitable therapeutic strategy for patients who do not respond to eradication.	2011	07	14	Gut Liver	Suzuki	Hidekazu
20695076	10.4248/IJOS.09059	CXCL12/SDF-1 alpha activates NF-kappaB and promotes oral cancer invasion through the Carma3/Bcl10/Malt1 complex.	To determine how SDF-1 alpha/CXCR4 activates nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) invasion. A lentivirus-based knockdown approach was utilized to deplete gene expression. NF-kappaB activation was evaluated by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA). We show that the activation of NF-kappaB by CXCR4 occurs through the Carma3/Bcl10/Malt1 (CBM) complex in OSCC. We found that loss of components of the CBM complex in HNSCC can inhibit SDF-1 alpha induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, while TNF alpha induced IKK activation remains unchanged. Further, we identified a role for novel and atypical, but not classical, PKCs in activating IKK through CXCR4. Importantly, inhibition of the CBM complex leads to a significant decrease in SDF-1 alpha mediated invasion of OSCC. The CBM complex plays a critical role in CXCR4-induced NF-kappaB activation in OSCC. Targeting molecular components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway may provide an important therapeutic opportunity in controlling the progression and metastasis of OSCC mediated by SDF-1 alpha.	2010	09	14	Int J Oral Sci	Rehman	Aasia O
17893875	10.1002/ijc.23071	Erythropoietin treatment of human ovarian cancer cells results in enhanced signaling and a paclitaxel-resistant phenotype.	Erythropoietin (Epo), a glycoprotein hormone that is the principal regulator of erythropoiesis, is known to act also on nonhematopoietic cell types. Epo receptors have been reported on several normal and neoplastic human cells and tissues, including ovarian cancer cells. We found that long-term Epo treatment of A2780 cells resulted in the development of a phenotype exhibiting both enhanced Epo signaling, evidenced by increased peak levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and increased paclitaxel resistance. This phenotypic effect was specific for paclitaxel, since no change in cisplatin or carboplatin sensitivity was observed. In addition, the change in phenotype was stable, even after the removal of Epo. Measurement of mono- and oligonucleosome formation revealed that long-term Epo treated A2780 cells exhibited markedly less apoptosis than nonerythropoietin treated cells at essentially all concentrations of paclitaxel tested. Western blot analyses revealed that the long-term Epo treated cells had significantly reduced expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-10. These findings may have implications for the clinical use of recombinant human Epo and other erythropoiesis stimulating agents to correct anemia in paclitaxel-treated cancer patients.	2008	01	08	Int J Cancer	Solar	Peter
18175935	10.1248/bpb.31.13	Dissociation of Toll-like receptor 2-mediated innate immune response to Zymosan by organic solvent-treatment without loss of Dectin-1 reactivity.	Zymosan activates phagocytes through the innate immune system and causes inflammatory responses in animals. Because of the complexity of the active substances included in Zymosan preparations, simplifying the active moiety actually responsible for innate immune recognition is needed. One way to remove possible active substances from commercially available Zymosan preparations is to wash then with pyrogen-free water to obtain a ZWIS (Zymosan water insoluble fraction), ethanol insoluble (EtIS), or chloroform/methanol insoluble (CMIS) preparation. The effects of various washed Zymosan preparations on nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and binding to beta-glucan recognition protein were examined. Significant NF-kappaB activation by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-expressing HEK293 cells and enhanced NF-kappaB activity via the co-expression of TLR2 and Dectin-1, a functional beta-glucan receptor, was only observed in response to ZWIS. However, the ability of Zymosan preparations to bind Dectin-1 protein was not altered even after treatment with the organic solvents by which the TLR2-mediated NF-kappaB activity was abolished. Another NF-kappaB activation pathway involving CARD9/Bcl10 was triggered by these Zymosan preparations in the presence of Dectin-1. The results suggest that the beta-glucan-dependent characteristics of Zymosan were not affected by the washing with chloroform/methanol or ethanol, and that TLR2-mediated activity was easily eliminated with these organic solvents. This treatment might be useful for distinguishing natural ligands for TLR2 and beta-glucan receptors when studying the innate immune response to fungal macromolecules.	2008	02	06	Biol Pharm Bull	Ikeda	Yoshihiko
18192506	10.1182/blood-2007-11-123513	Multiple ITAM-coupled NK-cell receptors engage the Bcl10/Malt1 complex via Carma1 for NF-kappaB and MAPK activation to selectively control cytokine production.	Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that mediate resistance against viruses and tumors. They express multiple activating receptors that couple to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing signaling chains for downstream cell activation. Ligation of activating NK-cell receptors induces NK-cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release. How these distinct events are selectively controlled is not well defined. Here we report the identification of a specific signaling pathway that operates downstream of the ITAM-coupled NK-cell receptors NK1.1, Ly49D, Ly49H, and NKG2D. Using primary NK cells from Bcl10(-/-), Malt1(-/-), Carma1(-/-), and Card9(-/-) mice, we demonstrate a key role for Bcl10 signalosomes in the activation of canonical NF-kappaB signaling as well as JNK and p38 MAPK upon NK-cell triggering. Bcl10 directly cooperates with Malt1 and depends on Carma1 (Card11) but not on Card9 for NK-cell activation. These Bcl10-dependent cascades selectively control cytokine and chemokine production but do not affect NK-cell differentiation or killing. Thus, we identify a molecular basis for the segregation of NK-cell receptor-induced signals for cytokine release and target cell killing and extend the previously recognized roles for CARD-protein/Bcl10/Malt1 complexes in ITAM receptor signaling in innate and adaptive immune cells.	2008	10	30	Blood	Gross	Olaf
18223652	10.1038/ni1561	T cell antigen receptor stimulation induces MALT1 paracaspase-mediated cleavage of the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20.	The paracaspase MALT1 mediates T cell antigen receptor-induced signaling to the transcription factor NF-kappaB and is indispensable for T cell activation and proliferation. Enhanced expression of MALT1 or aberrant expression of a fusion protein of the apoptosis inhibitor API2 and MALT1 has been linked to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Despite the presence of a caspase-like domain, MALT1 proteolytic activity has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that T cell antigen receptor stimulation induced recruitment of the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20 into a complex of MALT1 and the adaptor protein Bcl-10, leading to MALT1-mediated processing of A20. API2-MALT1 expression likewise resulted in cleavage of A20. MALT1 cleaved human A20 after arginine 439 and impaired its NF-kappaB-inhibitory function. Our studies identify A20 as a substrate of MALT1 and emphasize the importance of MALT1 proteolytic activity in the 'fine tuning' of T cell antigen receptor signaling.	2008	03	18	Nat Immunol	Coornaert	Beatrice
18227156	10.1128/MCB.01505-07	T-cell receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation is negatively regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b.	It has previously been shown that E3 ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma-b (Cbl-b) negatively regulates T-cell activation, but the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this inhibition is not completely defined. In this study, we report that the loss of Cbl-b selectively results in aberrant activation of NF-kappaB upon T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation, which is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt and protein kinase C-theta (PKC-theta). TCR-induced hyperactivation of Akt in the absence of Cbl-b may potentiate the formation of caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 1 (CARMA1)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10)-mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue 1(MALT1) (CBM) complex, which appears to be independent of PKC-theta. Cbl-b associates with PKC-theta upon TCR stimulation and regulates TCR-induced PKC-theta activation via Vav-1, which couples PKC-theta to PI3-K and allows it to be phosphorylated. PKC-theta then couples IkappaB kinases (IKKs) to the CBM complex, resulting in the activation of the IKK complex. Therefore, our data provide the first evidence to demonstrate that the down-regulation of TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation by Cbl-b is mediated coordinately by both Akt-dependent and PKC-theta-dependent signaling pathways in primary T cells.	2008	05	01	Mol Cell Biol	Qiao	Guilin

18252714	10.1074/jbc.M708833200	Toll-like receptor 4 mediates induction of the Bcl10-NFkappaB-interleukin-8 inflammatory pathway by carrageenan in human intestinal epithelial cells.	The sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan (CGN) induces activation of NFkappaB and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in human colonic epithelial cells through a pathway of innate immunity mediated by Bcl10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10). In this report, we identify Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a member of the family of innate immune receptors, as the surface membrane receptor for CGN in human colonic epithelial cells. Experiments with fluorescence-tagged CGN demonstrated a marked reduction in binding of CGN to human intestinal epithelial cells and to RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, following exposure to TLR4 blocking antibody (HTA-125). Binding of CGN to 10ScNCr/23 mouse macrophages, which are deficient in the genetic locus for TLR4, was absent. Additional experiments with TLR4 blocking antibody and TLR4 small interfering RNAs showed 80% reductions in CGN-induced increases in Bcl10 and IL-8. Transfection with dominant-negative MyD88 plasmid demonstrated MyD88 dependence of the CGN-TLR4-triggered increases in Bcl10 and IL-8. Therefore, these results indicate that CGN-induced inflammation in human colonocytes proceeds through a pathway of innate immunity, perhaps related to the unusual alpha-1,3-galactosidic linkage characteristic of CGN, and suggest how dietary CGN intake may contribute to human intestinal inflammation. Because CGN is a commonly used food additive in the Western diet, clarification of its effects and mechanisms of action are vital to issues of food safety.	2008	06	10	J Biol Chem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
18264101	10.1038/ni1568	The proteolytic activity of the paracaspase MALT1 is key in T cell activation.	The paracaspase MALT1 is pivotal in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation and lymphomagenesis. MALT1 contains a caspase-like domain, but it is unknown whether this domain is proteolytically active. Here we report that MALT1 had arginine-directed proteolytic activity that was activated after T cell stimulation, and we identify the signaling protein Bcl-10 as a MALT1 substrate. Processing of Bcl-10 after Arg228 was required for T cell receptor-induced cell adhesion to fibronectin. In contrast, MALT1 activity but not Bcl-10 cleavage was essential for optimal activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB and production of interleukin 2. Thus, the proteolytic activity of MALT1 is central to T cell activation, which suggests a possible target for the development of immunomodulatory or anticancer drugs.	2008	03	18	Nat Immunol	Rebeaud	Fabien
18287044	10.1073/pnas.0712313105	NEMO recognition of ubiquitinated Bcl10 is required for T cell receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	The mechanism by which the Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex couples T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling to IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB activation is not known. Here, we show that Bcl10 undergoes K63-linked polyubiquitination in response to T cell activation and subsequently binds NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. This interaction requires the ubiquitin-binding activity of NEMO. The sites of Bcl10 ubiquitination were mapped to K31 and K63. Mutation of these residues did not affect TCR signaling-induced CBM complex assembly but prevented Bcl10 ubiquitination, NEMO binding, and NF-kappaB activation. Therefore, the regulated ubiquitination of Bcl10 and its recognition by NEMO are a critical link between the CBM complex, IKK recruitment, and NF-kappaB activation.	2008	04	29	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Wu	Chuan-Jin
18316375	10.1074/jbc.M707988200	Sequestration of NF-kappaB signaling complexes in lipid rafts contributes to repression of NF-kappaB in T lymphocytes under hyperthermia stress.	Sepsis causes extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, a pathological condition that is frequently associated with hyperthermia. Heat stress has been implicated to repress the activation of an inflammatory mediator, nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-kappaB), which sensitizes cells to apoptosis mediated by inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, the molecular mechanism of hyperthermia-associated loss of T cells remains unclear. We show that hyperthermia causes rapid translocation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB complexes into the plasma membrane-associated lipid rafts in T cells. Heat stress induces aggregation of Carma1 in lipid rafts, which in turn recruits protein kinase C theta (PKC theta) and Bcl10 to the microdomains, causing subsequent membrane translocation of the IKK and NF-kappaB signalosomes. Depletion of Carma1 and inhibition of PKC theta impair accumulation of NF-kappaB complexes in lipid rafts. Heat stress prohibits IkappaB kinase activity by sequestrating the IKK and NF-kappaB complexes in lipid rafts and by segregating the chaperone protein Hsp90, an essential cofactor for IKK, from the IKK complex. This process ultimately results in functional deficiency of NF-kappaB and renders T cells resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced activation of IKK, thereby contributing to the apoptotic loss of T lymphocytes in sepsis-associated hyperthermia.	2008	06	19	J Biol Chem	Yan	Guang
18349075	10.1242/jcs.021105	A20 is a negative regulator of BCL10- and CARMA3-mediated activation of NF-kappaB.	The molecular complex containing CARMA proteins, BCL10 and TRAF6 has been identified recently as a key component in the signal transduction pathways that regulate activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor. Here, we report that the inducible protein A20 negatively regulates these signaling cascades by means of its deubiquitylation activity. We show that A20 perturbs assembly of the complex containing CARMA3, BCL10 and IKKgamma/NEMO, thereby suppressing activation of NF-kappaB. Together, our results further define the molecular mechanisms that control activation of NF-kappaB and reveal a function for A20 in the regulation of CARMA and BCL10 activity in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells.	2008	08	05	J Cell Sci	Stilo	Romania
18445693	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4946	Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus predict better survival in gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	The pathogenesis and clinical heterogeneity of gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are poorly understood. We have comprehensively investigated the incidence and clinical significance of lymphoma-associated chromosomal translocations, particularly those involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene locus, in a large series of gastric DLBCL. One hundred forty-one cases of primary gastric DLBCL [58 with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and 83 without MALT lymphoma] were enrolled. Translocations involving BCL6, c-MYC, FOXP1, MALT1, and IGH were investigated using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. In positive cases, additional fluorescence in situ hybridization was done with appropriate probes for potential partner genes. Cases were classified into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) or non-GCB subgroups by immunophenotyping with CD10, BCL6, and MUM1. Translocations involving IGH were detected in 36 (32%) of 111 cases; their partner genes included BCL6 (n = 10), c-MYC (n = 5), and FOXP1 (n = 3) but remained unknown in the remaining 18 cases. t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2, t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1, and t(1;14)/BCL10-IGH were not detected in any case. t(11;18)/API2-MALT1 was detected in none of the cases, except for one case of DLBCL with MALT lymphoma, which showed positive signals only in MALT lymphoma cells. IGH-involved translocation was associated with younger age but not with any other clinicopathologic factors including GCB or non-GCB immunophenotypes. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that IGH-involved translocation, in addition to younger age and early stage, was an independent prognostic factor for better overall and EFSs. IGH-involved translocations are frequent in gastric DLBCL and seem to identify cases with favorable prognosis.	2008	08	18	Clin Cancer Res	Nakamura	Shotaro
18452717	10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.03.019	Carrageenan-induced NFkappaB activation depends on distinct pathways mediated by reactive oxygen species and Hsp27 or by Bcl10.	Carrageenans are highly sulfated polysaccharides that are widely used as food additives due to their ability to improve food texture. They are also widely recognized for their ability to induce inflammation in animal models of colitis. Recently, we reported that carrageenan (CGN) activated a pathway of innate immunity in human colonic epithelial cells mediated by Bcl10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10). However, increases in phospho-IkappaBalpha and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were not completely inhibited by silencing Bcl10, suggesting that CGN also influenced another mechanism, or mechanisms, of inflammation. In this report, we demonstrate that CGN increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human colonic epithelial cells. The combination of ROS quenching by the free radical scavenger Tempol and of Bcl10 silencing by siRNA completely inhibited the CGN-induced increases in nuclear NFkappaB (p65), phospho-IkappaBalpha, and secretion of IL-8. The CGN-induced increase in ROS was associated with declines in phosphorylation of MAPK 12 (p38gamma), MAPK 13 (p38delta), and heat-shock protein (Hsp) 27. The CGN-induced decline in phospho-Hsp27 was reversed by co-administration of Tempol (100 nM), but unaffected by silencing Bcl10. Since Hsp27 phosphorylation is inversely associated with phosphorylation of the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) signalosome, CGN exposure appears to affect the IKK signalosome by both the catalytic component, mediated by ROS-phospho-Hsp27, and the regulatory component, mediated by Bcl10 interaction with IKKgamma (Nemo). Hence, the CGN-activated inflammatory cascades related to innate immunity and to generation of ROS may be integrated at the level of the IKK signalosome.	2008	07	28	Biochim Biophys Acta	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
18550498	10.3724/sp.j.1005.2008.00747	[In silico identification, molecular cloning and verification of a novel pig gene homologous to human BCL10 of innate immunity and its preliminary expression profiles in pigs].	We identified and characterized a novel swine gene Bcl10 with GenBank (Accession No. EU088132) which was homologous to human BCL10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10) gene. The full-length cDNA of 925 bp for swine BCL10 was in silico cloned, and then its ORF of 702 bp coding 233 amino acid residues was verified by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. NCBI BLAST assay indicated that this cDNA contained three extrons with a length of 57, 289 and 356 bp respectively, and it was located on the chromosome 4 of pig genome. Using semi-quantitative PCR, preliminary expression profiles of swine BCL10 were verified in different swine tissues. The expression of swine BCL10 was verified by GFP marker and RT-PCR assay. We found that, BCL10 expressed in high level in swine spleen, and with a modest level in thymus, brain and lymph node; low level mRNA was expressed in liver and not detectable level in kidney. The swine BCL10 gene was cloned to the GFP-containing eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1 and transfected to PK-15 cell line by lipofectin. BCL10 was ex-pressed effectively in PK-15 cells. In summary, we cloned a novel swine BCL10 gene, and investigated its expression char-acters. This will be the fundament of the future research on its function.	2009	03	19	Yi Chuan	He	Jian-Feng
18575460	10.1038/nri2338	Multifunctional roles for MALT1 in T-cell activation.	The activation of T cells is vital to the successful elimination of pathogens, but can also have a deleterious role in autoimmunity and transplant rejection. Various signalling pathways are triggered by the T-cell receptor; these have key roles in the control of the T-cell response and represent interesting targets for therapeutic immunomodulation. Recent findings define MALT1 (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue lymphoma-translocation gene 1) as a protein with proteolytic activity that controls T-cell activation by regulating key molecules in T-cell-receptor-induced signalling pathways.	2008	07	17	Nat Rev Immunol	Thome	Margot
18583339	10.1074/jbc.M802344200	T cell receptor-mediated activation of CD4+CD44hi T cells bypasses Bcl10: an implication of differential NF-kappaB dependence of naïve and memory T cells during T cell receptor-mediated responses.	Previous studies have demonstrated that Bcl10 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10) is essential for T cell receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation and subsequent proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL2) production. However, here we demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, Bcl10 is differentially required for T cell activation, including for both proliferation and cytokine production. When CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were divided based on expression levels of CD44, which distinguishes naïve cells (CD44lo) versus those that are antigen-experienced (CD44hi), IL2 production by and proliferation of CD4+CD44lo naïve cells and both subpopulations of CD8+ T cells were clearly Bcl10-dependent, whereas these same functional properties of CD4+CD44hi T cells occurred largely independent of Bcl10. As with the other subpopulations of T cells, CD4+CD44hi T cells did not activate the NF-kappaB pathway in the absence of Bcl10; nevertheless, these CD4+CD44hi antigen-experienced T cells efficiently secreted IL2 after T cell receptor stimulation. Strikingly, therefore, T cell receptor-mediated IL2 production in these cells is NF-kappaB-independent. Our studies suggest that antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells differ from their naïve counterparts and from CD8+ T cells in their ability to achieve activation independent of the Bcl10/NF-kappaB pathway.	2008	10	20	J Biol Chem	Zeng	Hu
18606643	10.4049/jimmunol.181.2.918	Cell type-specific regulation of ITAM-mediated NF-kappaB activation by the adaptors, CARMA1 and CARD9.	Activating NK cell receptors transduce signals through ITAM-containing adaptors, including FcRgamma and DAP12. Although the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)9-Bcl10 complex is essential for FcRgamma/DAP12-mediated NF-kappaB activation in myeloid cells, its involvement in NK cell receptor signaling is unknown. Herein we show that the deficiency of CARMA1 or Bcl10, but not CARD9, resulted in severe impairment of cytokine/chemokine production mediated by activating NK cell receptors due to a selective defect in NF-kappaB activation, whereas cytotoxicity mediated by the same receptors did not require CARMA1-Bcl10-mediated signaling. IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation by direct protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin (P/I) was abrogated in CARMA1-deficient NK cells, similar to T and B lymphocytes, whereas CARD9-deficient dendritic cells (DCs) exhibited normal P/I-induced IKK activation. Surprisingly, CARMA1 deficiency also abrogated P/I-induced IKK activation in DCs, indicating that CARMA1 is essential for PKC-mediated NF-kappaB activation in all cell types, although the PKC-CARMA1 axis is not used downstream of myeloid ITAM receptors. Consistently, PKC inhibition abrogated ITAM receptor-mediated activation only in NK cells but not in DCs, suggesting PKC-CARMA1-independent, CARD9-dependent ITAM receptor signaling in myeloid cells. Conversely, the overexpression of CARD9 in CARMA1-deficient cells failed to restore the PKC-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Thus, NF-kappaB activation signaling through ITAM receptors is regulated by a cell type-specific mechanism depending on the usage of adaptors CARMA1 and CARD9, which determines the PKC dependence of the signaling.	2008	08	12	J Immunol	Hara	Hiromitsu
18625728	10.1128/MCB.00418-08	The protein kinase C-responsive inhibitory domain of CARD11 functions in NF-kappaB activation to regulate the association of multiple signaling cofactors that differentially depend on Bcl10 and MALT1 for association.	The activation of NF-kappaB by T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling is critical for T-cell activation during the adaptive immune response. CARD11 is a multidomain adapter that is required for TCR signaling to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. During TCR signaling, the region in CARD11 between the coiled-coil and PDZ domains is phosphorylated by protein kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta) in a required step in NF-kappaB activation. In this report, we demonstrate that this region functions as an inhibitory domain (ID) that controls the association of CARD11 with multiple signaling cofactors, including Bcl10, TRAF6, TAK1, IKKgamma, and caspase-8, through an interaction that requires both the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and the coiled-coil domain. Consistent with the ID-mediated control of their association, we demonstrate that TRAF6 and caspase-8 associate with CARD11 in T cells in a signal-inducible manner. Using an RNA interference rescue assay, we demonstrate that the CARD, linker 1, coiled-coil, linker 3, SH3, linker 4, and GUK domains are each required for TCR signaling to NF-kappaB downstream of ID neutralization. Requirements for the CARD, linker 1, and coiled-coil domains in signaling are consistent with their roles in the association of CARD11 with Bcl10, TRAF6, TAK1, caspase-8, and IKKgamma. Using Bcl10- and MALT1-deficient cells, we show that CARD11 can recruit signaling cofactors independently of one another in a signal-inducible manner.	2008	09	29	Mol Cell Biol	McCully	Ryan R
18628489	10.1182/blood-2008-02-137513	Overexpression of B cell-activating factor of TNF family (BAFF) is associated with Helicobacter pylori-independent growth of gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with histologic evidence of MALT lymphoma.	We have recently demonstrated that nuclear expression of BCL10 predicts Helicobacter pylori (HP) independence of early-stage gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with histologic evidence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). In this study, we examined the role of B cell-activating factor of TNF family (BAFF) in mediating BCL10 nuclear translocation and HP independence of gastric DLBCL (MALT). We used immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting to measure the expression of BAFF, pAKT, BCL3, BCL10, and NF-kappaB. Transactivity of NF-kappaB was measured by electromobility shift assay. In lymphoma samples from 26 patients with gastric DLBCL (MALT), we detected aberrant expression of BAFF in 7 of 10 (70%) HP-independent and in 3 of 16 (18.8%) HP-dependent cases (P = .015). BAFF overexpression was associated with pAKT expression (P = .032), and nuclear expression of BCL3 (P = .014), BCL10 (P = .015), and NF-kappaB (P = .004). In B-cell lymphoma Pfeiffer cells, BAFF activated NF-kappaB and AKT; the activated NF-kappaB up-regulated BCL10, and the activated AKT caused formation of BCL10/BCL3 complexes that translocated to the nucleus. Inhibition of AKT by LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) blocked BCL10 nuclear translocation, NF-kappaB transactivity, and BAFF expression. Our results indicate that autocrine BAFF signal transduction pathways may contribute to HP-independent growth of gastric DLBCL (MALT).	2008	10	09	Blood	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
18718996	10.1152/ajpgi.90434.2008	Lipopolysaccharide activates NF-kappaB by TLR4-Bcl10-dependent and independent pathways in colonic epithelial cells.	In colonic epithelium, one of the pathways of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of NF-kappaB and IL-8 is via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, MyD88, IRAK1/4, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10). However, this innate immune pathway accounts for only approximately 50% of the NF-kappaB activation, so additional mechanisms to explain the LPS-induced effects are required. In this report, we identify a second pathway of LPS-induced stimulation, mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), in human colonic epithelial tissue cells in tissue culture and in ex vivo mouse colonic tissue. Measurements of IL-8, KC, Bcl10, phospho-IkappaBalpha, nuclear NF-kappaB, and phosphorylated Hsp27 were performed by ELISA. The TLR4-Bcl10 pathway was inhibited by Bcl10 siRNA and in studies with colonic tissue from the TLR4-deficient mouse. The ROS pathway was inhibited by Tempol, a free radical scavenger, or by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of Hsp27 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The ROS pathway was unaffected in the TLR4-deficient tissue or by silencing of Bcl10. The combination of exposure to the free radical scavenger Tempol and of TLR4 or Bcl10 suppression was required to completely inhibit the LPS-induced activation. The ROS pathway was associated with dephosphorylation of Hsp27. LPS appears to activate both the regulatory component of the IkappaBalpha-kinase (IKK) signalosome through Bcl10 interaction with Nemo (IKKgamma) and the catalytic component through Hsp27 interaction with IKKbeta. Since LPS exposure is associated with septic shock and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, distinguishing between these two pathways of LPS activation may facilitate new approaches to prevention and treatment.	2008	11	26	Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
18802088	10.4049/jimmunol.181.7.4840	Distinct regulation of integrin-dependent T cell conjugate formation and NF-kappa B activation by the adapter protein ADAP.	Following TCR stimulation, T cells utilize the hematopoietic specific adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP) to control both integrin adhesive function and NF-kappaB transcription factor activation. We have investigated the molecular basis by which ADAP controls these events in primary murine ADAP(-/-) T cells. Naive DO11.10/ADAP(-/-) T cells show impaired adhesion to OVAp (OVA aa 323-339)-bearing APCs that is restored following reconstitution with wild-type ADAP. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the central proline-rich domain and the C-terminal domain of ADAP are required for rescue of T:APC conjugate formation. The ADAP proline-rich domain is sufficient to bind and stabilize the expression of SKAP55 (Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa), which is otherwise absent from ADAP(-/-) T cells. Interestingly, forced expression of SKAP55 in the absence of ADAP is insufficient to drive T:APC conjugate formation, demonstrating that both ADAP and SKAP55 are required for optimal LFA-1 function. Additionally, the ADAP proline-rich domain is required for optimal Ag-induced activation of CD69, CD25, and Bcl-x(L), but is not required for assembly of the CARMA1/Bcl10/Malt1 (caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein 1/B-cell CLL-lymphoma 10/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) signaling complex and subsequent TCR-dependent NF-kappaB activity. Our results indicate that ADAP is used downstream of TCR engagement to delineate two distinct molecular programs in which the ADAP/SKAP55 module is required for control of T:APC conjugate formation and functions independently of ADAP/CARMA1-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	2008	12	24	J Immunol	Burbach	Brandon J
18806265	10.1074/jbc.M800670200	Multiple protein domains mediate interaction between Bcl10 and MALT1.	Bcl10 and MALT1 are essential mediators of NF-kappaB activation in response to the triggering of a diverse array of transmembrane receptors, including antigen receptors. Additionally, both proteins are translocation targets in MALT lymphoma. Thus, a detailed understanding of the interaction between these mediators is of considerable biological importance. Previous studies have indicated that a 13-amino acid region downstream of the Bcl10 caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is responsible for interacting with the immunoglobulin-like domains of MALT1. We now provide evidence that the death domain of MALT1 and the CARD of Bcl10 also contribute to Bcl10-MALT1 interactions. Although a direct interaction between the MALT1 death domain and Bcl10 cannot be detected via immunoprecipitation, FRET data strongly suggest that the death domain of MALT1 contributes significantly to the association between Bcl10 and MALT1 in T cells in vivo. Furthermore, analysis of point mutants of conserved residues of Bcl10 shows that the Bcl10 CARD is essential for interaction with the MALT1 N terminus. Mutations that disrupt proper folding of the Bcl10 CARD strongly impair Bcl10-MALT1 interactions. Molecular modeling and functional analyses of Bcl10 point mutants suggest that residues Asp(80) and Glu(84) of helix 5 of the Bcl10 CARD directly contact MALT1. Together, these data demonstrate that the association between Bcl10 and MALT1 involves a complex interaction between multiple protein domains. Moreover, the Bcl10-MALT1 interaction is the second reported example of interactions between a CARD and a non-CARD protein region, which suggests that many signaling cascades may utilize CARD interactions with non-CARD domains.	2009	01	22	J Biol Chem	Langel	Felicia D
18829987	10.1093/intimm/dxn108	CD28 stimulation triggers NF-kappaB activation through the CARMA1-PKCtheta-Grb2/Gads axis.	CD28 stimulation contributes to activation of the IL-2 promoter by up-regulating the activity of several transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)/Rel family members. However, the signal-transducing cascades linking the CD28 molecule and activation of NF-kappaB remain unclear. Protein kinase C (PKC) , CARMA1 and Bcl10 have recently been reported to integrate TCR-mediated NF-kappaB activation. However, since the data in these studies were drawn from experiments in which T cells were usually stimulated with both TCR and CD28, the relative contributions of TCR- and CD28-mediated signals to initiation of the NF-kappaB pathway remain elusive. To examine the role of these molecules in NF-kappaB activation through CD28-mediated stimulation, Bcl10 was over-expressed in Jurkat cells and their NF-kappaB activation by CD28- or TCR-cross-linking was evaluated. We found that CD28 stimulation alone can induce NF-kappaB activation in Bcl10-over-expressing Jurkat cells, whereas TCR stimulation alone has only little effect. In addition, we found that Bcl10-induced NF-kappaB activation through CD28-mediated stimulation could be blocked by the dominant-negative form of PKC or CARMA1. Furthermore, genetic studies revealed that Grb2/Gads binding, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding, is important in CD28-mediated NF-kappaB activation. These findings indicate that the PKC-CARMA1-Bcl10 signaling pathway participates in the CD28 co-stimulatory signal independently of the TCR-signaling pathway, which leads us to propose that the activation of the NF-kappaB-signaling pathway via PKC-CARMA1-Bcl10 may be markedly dependent on CD28 stimulation rather than TCR stimulation.	2009	07	30	Int Immunol	Takeda	Kei

18927281	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0702	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: novel translocations including rearrangements of ODZ2, JMJD2C, and CNN3.	The well-known translocations identified in MALT lymphomas include t(11;18)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)/IGH-BCL10, and t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1. Molecular investigations have suggested that these three disparate translocations affect a common pathway, resulting in the constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB. However, the vast majority of MALT lymphomas are negative for any of the above-mentioned translocations and the underlying pathogenesis is unclear. Fresh tissue of 29 gastric and extragastric MALT lymphomas was studied for genetic aberrations by conventional karyotyping, long-distance inverse PCR (LDI-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and RT-PCR identified aberrations in 26 of 29 MALT lymphoma. Balanced translocations were found in 21 cases. IGH was rearranged in the majority of cases with balanced translocations (n = 17/21); 3 cases had t(11;18)/API2-MALT1 and 1 case had novel t(6;7)(q25;q11), respectively. IGH partner genes involved MALT1, FOXP1, BCL6, and four new chromosomal regions on chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 5q, and 9p. LDI-PCR identified three novel partner genes on 1p (CNN3), 5q (ODZ2), and 9p (JMJD2C). FISH assays were established and confirmed LDI-PCR results. QRT-PCR showed deregulation of the novel genes in the translocation-positive cases. Our study expands the knowledge on the genetic heterogeneity of MALT lymphomas.	2008	12	16	Clin Cancer Res	Vinatzer	Ursula
18941215	10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6244	Loss of protein kinase C theta, Bcl10, or Malt1 selectively impairs proliferation and NF-kappa B activation in the CD4+ T cell subset.	The cytosolic proteins protein kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta), Bcl10, and Malt1 play critical roles in TCR signaling to the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Our data confirm that CD4(+) T cells from PKCtheta, Bcl10, and Malt1 knockout mice show severe impairment of proliferation in response to TCR stimulation. Unexpectedly, we find that knockout CD8(+) T cells proliferate to a similar extent as wild-type cells in response to strong TCR signals, although a survival defect prevents their accumulation. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) knockout T cells express activation markers, including CD25, following TCR stimulation. Addition of exogenous IL-2 rescues survival of knockout CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, but fails to overcome the proliferation defect of CD4(+) T cells. CD4(+) T cells from knockout mice are extremely deficient in TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation, whereas NF-kappaB activation is only partially impaired in CD8(+) T cells. Overall, our results suggest that defects in TCR signaling through PKCtheta, Bcl10, and Malt1 predominantly impair NF-kappaB activation and downstream functional responses of CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, CD8(+) T cells maintain substantial NF-kappaB signaling, implying the existence of a significant TCR-regulated NF-kappaB activation pathway in CD8(+) T cells that is independent of PKCtheta, Bcl10, and Malt1.	2009	01	21	J Immunol	Kingeter	Lara M
18949449	10.1007/s12185-008-0187-z	BCL10 nuclear expression and t(11;18)(q21;q21) indicate nonresponsiveness to Helicobacter pylori eradication of Chinese primary gastric MALT lymphoma.	The eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) with antibiotics induces complete remission in 75% of patients with gastric MALT lymphoma. We investigated the efficacy of H. pylori eradication and assessed the predictive value of BCL10 nuclear expression and t(11;18)(q21;q21) regarding resistance to H. pylori eradication in primary gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT lymphoma) patients from mainland China. Twenty-two gastric MALT cases (Stage I(E)) underwent H. pylori eradication with antibiotics, and sequential endoscopic-bioptic follow-ups were performed and assessed with regular morphologic and immunohistochemical examinations. BCL10 nuclear expression and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MALT1 and API2/MALT1 were tested. Thirteen out of the 22 cases (59.1%) achieved complete regression (CR) after the eradication of H. pylori. The longest follow-up period in the 22 patients was 68 months, with 12 patients longer than 24 months. For the 13 CR patients, the longest follow-up period after H. pylori eradication was 53 months, with 6 patients longer than 24 months. BCL10 nuclear expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining in 9 cases, including 7 (77.8%) of 9 cases who showed no response (NR) and 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients who achieved CR following eradication therapy (P &lt; 0.05). t(11;18)(q21;q21) was evaluated by interphase FISH in 18 cases including 11 CR and 7 NR patients after H. pylori eradication. t(11;18)(q21;q21) was found in 4 (57.1%) of 7 patients who showed NR following H. pylori eradication, but one in 11 CR patients (P &lt; 0.05). A total of 59.1% of patients with early gastric MALT lymphoma recruited in this study achieved CR after H. pylori eradication. BCL10 nuclear expression and t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive gastric MALT lymphomas are likely to be related to a failure to respond to H. pylori eradication in Chinese patients.	2009	04	14	Int J Hematol	Dong	Gehong

Sixty OA-MALT lymphomas were collected from Cancer Hospital of Fudan University. BCL10 was detected by immunohistochemical studies, and API2-MALT1 fusion gene, BCL10, MALT1 and IgH chromosomal abnormalities were detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the relation between nuclear BCL10 expression and chromosomal translocation. BCL10 expressed in 85.0% (51/60) OA-MALT lymphomas. Among these positive cases, 25 cases (41.7%) were expressed in the cytoplasm, and 26 cases (43.3%) were expressed in the nucleus. FISH results showed that no chromosomal abnormalities related with BCL10 and IgH genes, except 2 cases with API2-MALT1 fusion gene. Under statistic of Fisher exact test, nuclear BCL10 expression and API2-MALT1 fusion gene were two independent factors (P &gt; 0.05). BCL10 nuclear expression is common in OA-MALT lymphomas and may be used as a potential marker for the diagnosis of MALT lymphomas arising from ocular adnexa.

Twenty-three cases of pulmonary MALT lymphomas were collected from Cancer Hospital of Fudan University. BCL10 was detected by immunohistochemistry of EnVision method, and API2-MALT1, BCL10, MALT1, IgH chromosomal abnormalities were detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. BCL10 was expressed in 82.6% (19/23) of the pulmonary MALT lymphomas. Among those cases, 9 of 23 (39.1%) were expressed in the cytoplasm, and 10 of 23 (43.5%) were in the nucleus. In the FISH results, 9 cases (39.1%, 9/23) showed API2-MALT1 fusion gene, 1 case with possible BCL10-IgH abnormality, but none showed chromosomal abnormalities related with MALT1 and IgH gene simultaneously. Among 10 BCL10 nuclear expressive cases only 5 harbored genetic abnormalities. There was no correlation between BCL10 aberrant nuclear expression and chromosomal translocations (chi(2) = 0.306, P = 0.685). Follow-up of 10 cases for a period of 7 to 35 months showed that all the patients were alive. Because different treatments applied in different patients (chemotherapy only, surgery with chemotherapy or surgery only), best available treatment could not be confirmed in this study. t (11; 18)/API2-MALT1 was the most common chromosomal abnormality in pulmonary MALT lymphomas, but t (1; 14)/BCL10-IgH and t (14; 18)/MALT1-IgH were rare. Pulmonary MALT lymphomas also had higher nuclear BCL10 expression, which was not correlated with chromosomal abnormalities. As a result, BCL10 nuclear expression and cytogenetic aberration may be helpful in the diagnosis, especially for small biopsy specimens.	2010	09	09	Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi	Li	Bai-Zhou
19174606	10.1159/000195698	Methylation of p16INK4A and mitotic arrest defective protein 2 (MAD2) genes in gastric marginal-zone B-cell lymphomas.	Products of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4A)and mitotic arrest defective protein 2 (MAD2) genesare key regulator proteins at the G1 restriction point and mitotic checkpoint of the cell cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of promoter methylation of p16(INK4A) and MAD2 genes in gastric marginal-zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBCL). Gastric biopsies from 40 patients were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and the methylation status was compared with the results of BCL10 expression and t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation. p16(INK4A) was methylated in 30 of 40 MZBCLs (75%). The lymphomas with p16(INK4A) methylation tended to be negative for t(11;18)(q21;q21) (p = 0.011). MAD2 gene was methylated in 23 of 38 MZBCLs (61%). Lymphomas with MAD2 gene methylation more frequently expressed BCL10 (p = 0.037). These methylation profiles suggest that p16(INK4A) and MAD2 gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of MZBCL via different pathways; MAD2 gene is Helicobacter pylori independent with a close association with BCL10 while p16(INK4A) is H. pylori dependent with an inverse correlation with the t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation.	2009	04	02	Acta Haematol	Park	Sanghui
17052756	10.1016/j.molimm.2006.09.012	Bcl10 is phosphorylated on Ser138 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.	Ordered assembly of scaffold proteins Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 determines NF-kappaB activation following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Carma1-Bcl10 interaction and the signaling pathway are controlled by Carma1 phosphorylation, which are induced by PKCtheta and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). In addition to Carma1 phosphorylation, previous studies have demonstrated that Bcl10 is phosphorylated in the C-terminal Ser/Thr rich region following TCR engagement. However the kinases that phosphorylate Bcl10 are incompletely understood. Here we show that CaMKII phosphorylates Bcl10 on Ser138. Furthermore, a CaMKII inhibitor, KN93, and CaMKII siRNA substantially reduce Bcl10 phosphorylation induced by phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin. S138A mutation prolongs Bcl10-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that Bcl10 phosphorylation is involved in attenuation of NF-kappaB activation. These findings suggest that CaMKII modulates NF-kappaB activation via phosphorylating Bcl10 as well as Carma1.	2007	03	29	Mol Immunol	Ishiguro	Kazuhiro

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a potent bioactive phospholipid that stimulates a variety of cellular responses by acting on cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There is increasing evidence that LPA signaling reprograms gene expression, but the GPCR-induced pathways connecting LPA receptor stimulation to downstream transcription factors are not well characterized. Here, we identify the adapter proteins Bcl10 and Malt1 as essential mediators of LPA-induced NF-kappaB activation. Both proteins were previously known to activate NF-kappaB in response to antigen receptor ligation on lymphocytes, but their functions in nonimmune cells are still largely undefined. By using murine embryonic fibroblasts from Bcl10- or Malt1-deficient mice as a genetic model, we report that Bcl10 and Malt1 are critically required for the degradation of IkappaB-alpha and the subsequent NF-kappaB induction in response to LPA stimulation. Bcl10 and Malt1 cooperate with PKCs selectively for LPA-induced NF-kappaB activation but are dispensable for the activation of the Jnk, p38, Erk MAP kinase, and Akt signaling pathways. In a biological readout, we demonstrate that LPA-induced IL-6 production is abolished in the absence of Bcl10. Thus, our results identify a NF-kappaB-inducing signaling pathway downstream of GPCRs and reveal previously unrecognized functions for Bcl10/Malt1 signaling in nonimmune cells.	2007	02	07	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Klemm	Stefanie
17095757	10.1152/ajpgi.00380.2006	Carrageenan induces interleukin-8 production through distinct Bcl10 pathway in normal human colonic epithelial cells.	Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1 mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical significance.	2007	04	24	Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	Borthakur	Alip

17101977	10.1073/pnas.0601947103	CARMA3/Bcl10/MALT1-dependent NF-kappaB activation mediates angiotensin II-responsive inflammatory signaling in nonimmune cells.	Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a peptide hormone that, like many cytokines, acts as a proinflammatory agent and growth factor. After injury to the liver, the hormone assists in tissue repair by stimulating hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells to synthesize extracellular matrix proteins and secrete secondary cytokines and by stimulating myofibroblasts to proliferate. However, under conditions of chronic liver injury, all of these effects conspire to promote pathologic liver fibrosis. Much of this effect of Ang II results from activation of the proinflammatory NF-kappaB transcription factor in response to stimulation of the type 1 Ang II receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. Here, we characterize a previously undescribed signaling pathway mediating Ang II-dependent activation of NF-kappaB, which is composed of three principal proteins, CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1. Blocking the function of any of these proteins, through the use of either dominant-negative mutants, RNAi, or gene targeting, effectively abolishes Ang II-dependent NF-kappaB activation in hepatocytes. In addition, Bcl10(-/-) mice show defective hepatic cytokine production after Ang II treatment. Evidence also is presented that this pathway activates NF-kappaB through ubiquitination of IKKgamma, the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB kinase complex. These results elucidate a concrete series of molecular events that link ligand activation of the type 1 Ang II receptor to stimulation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. These findings also uncover a function of the CARMA, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins in cells outside the immune system.	2007	02	07	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	McAllister-Lucas	Linda M
17167822	10.1002/path.2117	Differential response to H. pylori eradication therapy of co-existing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and MALT lymphoma of stomach-significance of tumour cell clonality and BCL10 expression.	We recently reported that low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with MALToma (DLBCL[MALT]) of stomach are equally responsive to H. pylori eradication therapy (HPET) and that H. pylori-independent status is closely associated with nuclear translocation of BCL10. However, co-existing MALToma and DLBCL components of gastric DLBCL(MALT) may respond differentially to HPET and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Tumour tissue samples from 18 patients with microdissectable co-existing MALToma and DLBCL cells were studied. The clonality of lymphoma cells was examined by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of the CDR3 region of the IgH gene and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. BCL10 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Differential response of co-existing MALToma and DLBCL to HPET was defined as complete eradication of one component while the other component remained. Five (27.8%) of the 18 patients showed different IgH gene rearrangements in the two components and three (60%) of these five patients had differential response of MALToma and DLBCL to HPET. By contrast, 13 patients showed identical IgH gene rearrangements and only one (8%) of them had differential response of the two components to HPET (p = 0.044). Further, all four patients with differential response of MALToma and DLBCL to HPET showed nuclear expression of BCL10 in the H. pylori-independent component and cytoplasmic expression of BCL10 in the H. pylori-dependent component while the expression patterns of BCL10 were identical in both of these components in the 14 patients who had similar tumour response to HPET. We conclude that different clonality is a common reason for the differential response of co-existing MALToma and DLBCL of gastric DLBCL(MALT) to HPET and that immunohistochemical examination of BCL10 expression may help to identify the co-existence of these components.	2007	03	28	J Pathol	Kuo	S-H
17179215	10.1073/pnas.0601894104	Bcl10 plays a critical role in NF-kappaB activation induced by G protein-coupled receptors.	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play pivotal roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Although many studies indicate that the stimulation of GPCRs leads to NF-kappaB activation, the molecular mechanism by which GPCRs induced NF-kappaB activation remains largely unknown. Bcl10 is an essential adaptor molecule connecting antigen receptor signaling cascades to NF-kappaB activation in lymphocytes. However, the function of Bcl10 in nonlymphoid cells remains to be determined. In this study, we demonstrated that the deficiency of Bcl10 resulted in the defect in NF-kappaB activation induced by either expressing the constitutively active mutant of G protein or stimulation of cells with lysophosphatidic acid or endothelin-1, which activate their GPCR. In contrast, TNF-alpha-, LPS-, and integrin-induced NF-kappaB activation was not affected in Bcl10-deficient cells. Together, our results provide genetic evidence showing that Bcl10 is a key signaling component mediating NF-kappaB activation induced by GPCRs in nonlymphoid cells.	2007	02	07	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Wang	Donghai
17182539	10.4049/jimmunol.178.1.49	B cell lymphoma 10 is essential for FcepsilonR-mediated degranulation and IL-6 production in mast cells.	The adaptor protein B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) plays an essential role in the functions of the AgRs in T and B cells. In this study, we report that Bcl10 also plays an important role in mast cells. Bcl10 is expressed in mast cells. Although Bcl10-deficient mast cells undergo normal development, we demonstrate that Bcl10 is essential for specific functions of FcepsilonR. Although Bcl10-deficient mast cells have normal de novo synthesis and release of the lipid mediator arachidonic acid, the mutant cells possess impaired FcepsilonR-mediated degranulation, indicated by decreased serotonin release, and impaired cytokine production, measured by release of IL-6. In addition, Bcl10-deficient mice display impaired IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Moreover, although Bcl10-deficient mast cells have normal FcepsilonR-mediated Ca(2+) flux, activation of PI3K, and activation of the three types of MAPKs (ERKs, JNK, and p38), the mutant cells have markedly diminished FcepsilonR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and decreased activation of AP-1. Thus, Bcl10 is essential for FcepsilonR-induced activation of AP-1, NF-kappaB, degranulation, and cytokine production in mast cells.	2007	03	06	J Immunol	Chen	Yuhong

In view of the certain anatomic site-dependent frequency of chromosomal translocations involved in extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) pathogenesis, 17 salivary gland MALT lymphoma cases were analyzed for MALT1 and FOXP1 translocations. B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and forkhead box PA (FOXP1) protein expression were studied by immunohistochemistry and translocations identified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-specific probes FOXP1, t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1 and t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IgH-MALT1. None of the 11 analyzed cases showed FOXP1 rearrangement or amplification. The t(11;18) was present in five of 13 cases and the t(14;18) in three of 13 cases. MALT1 translocations were mostly mutually exclusive except in a single case. FOXP1 protein expression showed differences in the proportion of tumor cells with nuclear expression but not in their intensity, with the exception of one case where very intense nuclear staining was noted. BCL10 nuclear expression was present in four of 17 cases, two of which lacked t(11;18). Our results suggest that MALT1-specific translocations and FOXP1 rearrangements are not commonly involved in pathogenesis. A case with strong FOXP1 protein expression indicates the possibility that the upregulation of FOXP1 expression is significant in a small subset of salivary gland MALT lymphomas. Also a single case in which both MALT1 translocations were present indicates that these are not always mutually exclusive.	2007	02	01	Pathol Int	Borovecki	Ana
17202357	10.4049/jimmunol.178.2.953	Bcl10/Malt1 signaling is essential for TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation in thymocytes but dispensable for positive or negative selection.	During T cell development in the thymus, high-affinity/avidity TCR engagement induces negative selection by apoptosis, while lower affinity/avidity TCR interactions lead to positive selection and survival of thymocytes. Yet, the mechanisms that discriminate between positive and negative selection are not fully understood. One major regulator of survival and apoptosis in lymphoid cells is the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Several reports have indicated key roles for NF-kappaB in positive and negative selection. In peripheral T cells, TCR ligation activates NF-kappaB through a selective pathway that involves protein kinase Ctheta, Bcl10, and Malt1. While protein kinase Ctheta is dispensable for thymic TCR signaling, the molecular roles of Bcl10 and Malt1 in thymocytes have not been investigated. In the present study, we show that both Bcl10 and Malt1 are essential for TCR signaling in thymocytes as a genetic disruption of either molecule blocks TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation in these cells. To investigate the function of this pathway in thymic selection, we introduced the Bcl10 or Malt1 mutations into three well-established TCR transgenic mouse models. Surprisingly, using several in vivo or in vitro assays, we were unable to demonstrate a role for TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation in either positive or negative selection. Thus, while TCR signaling to NF-kappaB controls the activation of mature T cells, we suggest that this pathway is not involved in the positive or negative selection of thymocytes.	2007	02	22	J Immunol	Jost	Philipp J
17213322	10.1073/pnas.0606982104	Negative feedback loop in T cell activation through IkappaB kinase-induced phosphorylation and degradation of Bcl10.	Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB after stimulation through antigen receptors is important for lymphocyte differentiation, activation, proliferation, and protection against apoptosis. Much progress has been made in understanding the molecular events leading to NF-kappaB activation, but how this activation is eventually down-regulated is less well understood. Recent studies have indicated that Bcl10 functions downstream of lymphocyte antigen receptors to promote the activation of the IkappaB kinase complex leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of the IkappaB inhibitors of NF-kappaB. Bcl10 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, possibly in association with its nuclear localization. Here, we provide evidence that the IkappaB kinase complex phosphorylates Bcl10 after T cell antigen receptor stimulation and causes its proteolysis via the beta-TrCP ubiquitin ligase/proteasome pathway. These findings document a negative regulatory activity of the IKK complex and suggest that Bcl10 degradation is part of the regulatory mechanisms that precisely control the response to antigens. Mutants of Bcl10 in the IKK phosphorylation site are resistant to degradation, accumulate in the nucleus, and lead to an increase in IL-2 production after T cell antigen receptor stimulation.	2007	02	27	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Lobry	Camille
17287209	10.1074/jbc.M611038200	A Novel TRAF6 binding site in MALT1 defines distinct mechanisms of NF-kappaB activation by API2middle dotMALT1 fusions.	The recurrent translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma results in the expression of an API2.MALT1 fusion protein that constitutively activates NF-kappaB. The first baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain of API2 and the C terminus of MALT1, which contains its caspase-like domain, are present in all reported fusion variants and interact with TRAF2 and TRAF6, respectively, suggesting their contribution to NF-kappaB signaling by API2.MALT1. Also, the involvement of BCL10 has been suggested via binding to BIR1 of API2 and via its interaction with the immunoglobulin domains of MALT1, present in half of the fusion variants. However, conflicting reports exist concerning their roles in API2.MALT1-induced NF-kappaB signaling. In this report, streptavidin pulldowns of biotinylated API2.MALT1 fusion variants showed that none of the fusion variants interacted with endogenous BCL10; its role in NF-kappaB signaling by API2.MALT1 was further questioned by RNA interference experiments. In contrast, TRAF6 was essential for NF-kappaB activation by all fusion variants, and we identified a novel TRAF6 binding site in the second immunoglobulin domain of MALT1, which enhanced NF-kappaB activation when present in the fusion protein. Furthermore, inclusion of both immunoglobulin domains in API2.MALT1 further enhanced NF-kappaB signaling via intramolecular TRAF6 activation. Finally, binding of TRAF2 to BIR1 contributed to NF-kappaB activation by API2.MALT1, although additional mechanisms involving BIR1-mediated raft association are also important. Taken together, these data reveal distinct mechanisms of NF-kappaB activation by the different API2.MALT1 fusion variants with an essential role for TRAF6.	2007	06	06	J Biol Chem	Noels	Heidi
17317796	10.1354/vp.44-2-196	High-throughput immunophenotyping of 43 ferret lymphomas using tissue microarray technology.	To validate the use of the tissue microarray (TMA) method for immunophenotyping of ferret lymphomas, a TMA was constructed containing duplicate 1-mm cores sampled from 112 paraffin-embedded lymphoma tissue specimens obtained from 43 ferret lymphoma cases. Immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of CD3, CD79alpha, and Ki-67 (MIB-1) was determined by TMA and whole mount (WM) staining of each individual case for result comparison. There was a high correlation between CD79alpha and CD3 results comparing ferret TMA and WM sections (kappa statistic 0.71-0.73 for single-core TMA and 0.79-0.95 for duplicate-core TMA) and between continuous data from Ki-67 staining of ferret TMA sections and WM sections (concordance correlation coefficients 0.77 for single cores and 0.87 for duplicate cores). Subsequently, a panel of commercially available antibodies was applied to the TMA for the analysis of expression in ferret lymphomas. The results of this study confirmed previously published results suggesting specific cross-reactivity of the applied IHC markers (CD3, CD79alpha, Ki67) with ferret lymphoma tissue. Other IHC markers (CD45Ro, bcl2, bcl10, MUM1, CD30, vimentin) were also expressed in subsets of the included ferret lymphomas. Further studies are necessary to determine the usefulness of these markers for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of ferret lymphomas. In conclusion, the TMA technology was useful for rapid and accurate analysis of protein expression in large archival cohorts of ferret lymphoma cases.	2007	05	08	Vet Pathol	Hammer	A S
17356384	10.1097/01.jnen.0000248553.45456.96	Transcriptional profiling of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway identifies a subgroup of primary lymphoma of the central nervous system with low BCL10 expression.	Recent studies point to a role of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling in a subset of diffuse large B cell lymphomas. We have analyzed the expression of 21 genes encoding NF-kappaB family members, upstream modulators, and targets in 32 primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with nonmalignant germinal center centroblasts, expression of BCL10, REL, IAP1, and TRAF1 was significantly lower in PCNSLs, whereas that of BAX, BCLXL, BCL2, MALT1, CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, CARD14, CCND2, cFLIP, RELA, RELB, NFKB1, NFKB2, and IRF4 was higher. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data revealed two distinct subgroups of PCNSLs, which were characterized by significantly different transcriptional levels, predominantly of BCL10, but also of REL and IAP1. Thus, these quantitative RT-PCR data with expression of genes of the NF-kappaB family as well as NF-kappaB-regulated genes together with immunohistochemical detection of nuclear RELA and REL indicate activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in PCNSLs, which may contribute to their high proliferative activity and the low level of apoptosis.	2007	04	17	J Neuropathol Exp Neurol	Courts	Cornelius
17363905	10.1038/sj.emboj.7601622	Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the IkappaB kinase complex by two distinct signaling pathways.	The IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex serves as the master regulator for the activation of NF-kappaB by various stimuli. It contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory subunit, IKKgamma/NEMO. The activation of IKK complex is dependent on the phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta at its activation loop and the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. However, the molecular mechanism by which these inducible modifications occur remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that CARMA1, a key scaffold molecule, is essential to regulate NEMO ubiquitination upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. However, the phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta activation loop is independent of CARMA1 or NEMO ubiquitination. Further, we provide evidence that TAK1 is activated and recruited to the synapses in a CARMA1-independent manner and mediate IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation. Thus, our study provides the biochemical and genetic evidence that phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta and ubiquitination of NEMO are regulated by two distinct pathways upon TCR stimulation.	2007	05	14	EMBO J	Shambharkar	Prashant B
17371994	10.4049/jimmunol.178.7.4373	Bcl10 controls TCR- and FcgammaR-induced actin polymerization.	Bcl10 plays an essential role in the adaptive immune response, because Bcl10-deficient lymphocytes show impaired Ag receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation and cytokine production. Bcl10 is a phosphoprotein, but the physiological relevance of this posttranslational modification remains poorly defined. In this study, we report that Bcl10 is rapidly phosphorylated upon activation of human T cells by PMA/ionomycin- or anti-CD3 treatment, and identify Ser(138) as a key residue necessary for Bcl10 phosphorylation. We also show that a phosphorylation-deficient Ser(138)/Ala mutant specifically inhibits TCR-induced actin polymerization yet does not affect NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, silencing of Bcl10, but not of caspase recruitment domain-containing MAGUK protein-1 (Carma1) induces a clear defect in TCR-induced F-actin formation, cell spreading, and conjugate formation. Remarkably, Bcl10 silencing also impairs FcgammaR-induced actin polymerization and phagocytosis in human monocytes. These results point to a key role of Bcl10 in F-actin-dependent immune responses of T cells and monocytes/macrophages.	2007	06	19	J Immunol	Rueda	Daniel

17438001	10.1101/gad.1502507	CARMA3 deficiency abrogates G protein-coupled receptor-induced NF-{kappa}B activation.	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play pivotal roles in regulating various cellular functions. Although many GPCRs induce NF-kappaB activation, the molecular mechanism of GPCR-induced NF-kappaB activation remains largely unknown. CARMA3 (CARD and MAGUK domain-containing protein 3) is a scaffold molecule with unknown biological functions. By generating CARMA3 knockout mice using the gene targeting approach, here we show CARMA3 is required for GPCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. Mechanistically, we found that CARMA3 deficiency impairs GPCR-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation, although it does not affect GPCR-induced IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation, indicating that inducible phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta alone is not sufficient to induce its kinase activity. We also found that CARMA3 is physically associated with NEMO/IKKgamma, and induces polyubiquitination of an unknown protein(s) that associates with NEMO, likely by linking NEMO to TRAF6. Consistently, we found TRAF6 deficiency also abrogates GPCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. Together, our results provide the genetic evidence that CARMA3 is required for GPCR-induced NF-kappaB activation.	2007	05	22	Genes Dev	Grabiner	Brian C
17462996	10.1074/jbc.M610610200	Caspase-8 and c-FLIPL associate in lipid rafts with NF-kappaB adaptors during T cell activation.	Humans and mice lacking functional caspase-8 in T cells manifest a profound immunodeficiency syndrome due to defective T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-induced NF-kappaB signaling and proliferation. It is unknown how caspase-8 is activated following T cell stimulation, and what is the caspase-8 substrate(s) that is necessary to initiate T cell cycling. We observe that following TCR ligation, a small portion of total cellular caspase-8 and c-FLIP(L) rapidly migrate to lipid rafts where they associate in an active caspase complex. Activation of caspase-8 in lipid rafts is followed by rapid cleavage of c-FLIP(L) at a known caspase-8 cleavage site. The active caspase.c-FLIP complex forms in the absence of Fas (CD95/APO1) and associates with the NF-kappaB signaling molecules RIP1, TRAF2, and TRAF6, as well as upstream NF-kappaB regulators PKC theta, CARMA1, Bcl-10, and MALT1, which connect to the TCR. The lack of caspase-8 results in the absence of MALT1 and Bcl-10 in the active caspase complex. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of caspase activity attenuates NF-kappaB activation. The current findings define a link among TCR, caspases, and the NF-kappaB pathway that occurs in a sequestered lipid raft environment in T cells.	2007	09	17	J Biol Chem	Misra	Ravi S
17468049	10.1016/j.it.2007.04.004	Post-translational modifications regulate distinct functions of CARMA1 and BCL10.	Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is essential for the normal functioning of the immune system. Deregulated NF-kappaB signalling in lymphocytes can lead to immunodeficiency, but also to autoimmunity or lymphomas. Many of the signalling components controlling NF-kappaB activation in lymphocytes are now known, but it is less clear how distinct molecular components of this pathway are regulated. Here, we summarize recent findings on post-translational modifications of intracellular components of this pathway. Phosphorylation of the CARMA1 and BCL10 proteins and ubiquitylation of BCL10 affect the formation and stability of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, and also control negative feedback regulation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Moreover, the study of BCL10 phosphorylation isoforms has revealed a new mechanism controlling BCL10 nuclear translocation and an unexpected role for BCL10 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.	2007	08	09	Trends Immunol	Thome	Margot
17473310	10.1126/stke.3842007pe21	CARD-Bcl10-Malt1 signalosomes: missing link to NF-kappaB.	CARD11 (CARMA1), Bcl10, and Malt1 are required for nuclear factor NF-kappaB activation in response to antigen recognition. Initially, gene disruption experiments in mice pointed to a lymphocyte-specific role for CARD11-Bcl10-Malt1 complexes. However, strong evidence suggesting that conserved Bcl10-Malt1 complexes interact with different CARD scaffolds to connect various receptors in different cell types to NF-kappaB signaling has emerged more recently. The CARD10 (CARMA3)-Bcl10-Malt1 signalosome functions as a link between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and proinflammatory NF-kappaB activation. Further, Dectin-1-induced antifungal responses to NF-kappaB in dendritic cells depend on CARD9-Bcl10-Malt1. These results identify CARD-Bcl10-Malt1 signalosomes as pivotal regulators that link not only innate and adaptive immune responses, but also GPCR signaling, to the canonical NF-kappaB pathway.	2007	06	21	Sci STKE	Wegener	Elmar
17478723	10.1126/science.1137895	Regulation of NF-kappaB activation in T cells via association of the adapter proteins ADAP and CARMA1.	The adapter protein ADAP regulates T lymphocyte adhesion and activation. We present evidence for a previously unrecognized function for ADAP in regulating T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased phosphorylation of IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB). TCR-stimulated assembly of the CARMA1-BCL-10-MALT1 complex was substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. We further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association with the CARMA1 adapter and NF-kappaB activation but is not required for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion. These findings provide new insights into ADAP function and the mechanism by which CARMA1 regulates NF-kappaB activation in T cells.	2007	05	21	Science	Medeiros	Ricardo B
17502353	10.1128/MCB.01645-06	Phosphorylation of Bcl10 negatively regulates T-cell receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	Bcl10 (B-cell lymphoma 10) is an adaptor protein comprised of an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain and a C-terminal serine/threonine-rich domain. Bcl10 plays a critical role in antigen receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation and lymphocyte development and functions. Our current study has discovered that T-cell activation induced monophosphorylation and biphosphorylation of Bcl10 and has identified S138 within Bcl10 as one of the T-cell receptor-induced phosphorylation sites. Alteration of S138 to an alanine residue impaired T-cell activation-induced ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Bcl10, ultimately resulting in prolongation of TCR-mediated NF-kappaB activation and enhancement of interleukin-2 production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of Bcl10 at S138 down-regulates Bcl10 protein levels and thus negatively regulates T-cell receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	2007	08	23	Mol Cell Biol	Zeng	Hu

We assessed the incidence and clinical significance of the MALT lymphoma-associated genetic abnormalities t(11;18)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)/BCL10-IGH, t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1, t(3;14)/FOXP1-IGH, and extra copies of MALT1 and FOXP1 in gastric MALT lymphomas from Japan. The presence of translocations and copy number changes involving MALT1, IGH and FOXP1 were assessed in 90 cases of gastric MALT lymphoma using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). In cases carrying a MALT1 translocation, FISH for API2-MALT1 was performed, whereas in those carrying an IGH translocation, FISH was performed for BCL10, BCL6, BCL2, c-MYC and/or CCND1. t(11;18)/API2-MALT1 was detected in 18 of 87 (21%) cases and was significantly associated with Helicobacter pylori-negativity, resistance to H pylori eradication and Bcl10 nuclear expression. Four of 68 (6%) cases carried a translocation involving IGH and FOXP1 (n = 1), BCL2 (n = 1) or an unknown partner (n = 2). Neither t(1;14)/BCL10-IGH nor t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 was detected. Extra copies of MALT1 and FOXP1 were detected in 18 of 71 (25%) cases and 10 of 59 (17%) cases, respectively. The presence of extra copies of MALT1 was significantly associated with progression or relapse of lymphoma, and was an independent adverse prognostic factor for event-free survival as determined by multivariate analysis. t(11;18)/API2-MALT1 is frequent, whereas IGH-involved translocations are rare in gastric MALT lymphoma in Japan. The presence of extra copies of MALT1, often suggestive of partial or complete trisomy 18, is a frequent genetic aberration in gastric MALT lymphoma, which appears to predict adverse clinical behaviour.	2007	11	05	Gut	Nakamura	Shotaro
17540779	10.1152/ajpgi.00149.2007	Bcl10 mediates LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB and IL-8 in human intestinal epithelial cells.	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized as an inducer of the inflammatory response associated with gram-negative sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. LPS induction proceeds through Toll-like receptor (TLR) in immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). This report presents the first identification of Bcl10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10) as a mediator of the LPS-induced activation of IL-8 in human IEC. Bcl10 is a caspase-recruitment domain-containing protein, associated with constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphomas. The normal human IEC line NCM460, normal primary human colonocytes, and ex vivo human colonic tissue were exposed to 10 ng/ml of LPS for 2-6 h. Effects on Bcl10, phospho-IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaB, and IL-8 were determined by Western blot, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Effects of Bcl10 silencing by small-interfering RNA (siRNA), TLR4 blocking antibody, TLR4 silencing by siRNA, and an IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1/4 inhibitor on LPS-induced activation were examined. Following Bcl10 silencing, LPS-induced increases in NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, and IL-8 were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.001). Increasing concentrations of LPS were associated with higher concentrations of Bcl10 protein when quantified by ELISA, and the association between LPS exposure and increased Bcl10 was also demonstrated by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Exposure to TLR4 antibody, TLR4 siRNA, or an IRAK-1/4 inhibitor eliminated the LPS-induced increases in Bcl10, NF-kappaB, and IL-8. Identification of Bcl10 as a mediator of LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB and IL-8 in normal human IEC provides new insight into mechanisms of epithelial inflammation and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.	2007	09	26	Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
17613665	10.1080/15321810701454573	Development, evaluation, and application of a highly sensitive microtiter plate ELISA for human Bcl10 protein.	Bcl10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10) is a 233 amino acid CARD (caspase recruitment domain)-containing cellular protein, increasingly recognized as a mediator of NFkappaB activation in non-immune, as well as immune cells. Due to the importance of Bcl10 in diverse cell types, we developed a solid-phase, enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay to precisely measure Bcl10 in small volume cell lysates, using recombinant Bcl10 to standardize the assay. Standard curve measures Bcl10 from 0.25 ng/mL to 16 ng/mL, with very low intra- and inter-assay variation. Sample dilution and exogenous Bcl10 recovery experiments, comparisons with Western blot, and linear response to increasing doses of known Bcl10 activators confirm the specificity and precision of the ELISA.	2007	09	21	J Immunoassay Immunochem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
17660823	10.1038/ni1493	MALT1 directs B cell receptor-induced canonical nuclear factor-kappaB signaling selectively to the c-Rel subunit.	NF-kappaB (Rel) transcription factors control physiological and pathological immune cell function. The scaffold proteins Bcl-10 and MALT1 couple antigen-receptor signals to the canonical NF-kappaB pathway and are pivotal in lymphomagenesis. Here we found that Bcl-10 and MALT1 differentially regulated B cell receptor-induced activation of RelA and c-Rel. Bcl-10 was essential for recruitment of the kinase IKK into lipid rafts for the activation of RelA and c-Rel, for blocking apoptosis and for inducing division after B cell receptor ligation. In contrast, MALT1 participated in survival signaling but was not involved in IKK recruitment or activation and was dispensable for RelA induction and proliferation. MALT1 selectively activated c-Rel to control a distinct subprogram. Our results provide mechanistic insights into B cell receptor-induced survival and proliferation signals and demonstrate the selective control of c-Rel in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway.	2007	11	13	Nat Immunol	Ferch	Uta
17785812	10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.3752	Bcl10 plays a divergent role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine generation.	Activating receptors such as NKG2D and Ly49D mediate a multitude of effector functions including cytotoxicity and cytokine generation in NK cells. However, specific signaling events that are responsible for the divergence of distinct effector functions have yet to be determined. In this study, we show that lack of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein Bcl10 significantly affected receptor-mediated cytokine and chemokine generation, but not cytotoxicity against tumor cells representing ""missing-self"" or ""induced-self."" Lack of Bcl10 completely abrogated the generation of GM-CSF and chemokines and it significantly reduced the generation of IFN-gamma (&gt;75%) in NK cells. Commitment, development, and terminal maturation of NK cells were largely unaffected in the absence of Bcl10. Although IL-2-activated NK cells could mediate cytotoxicity to the full extent, the ability of the freshly isolated NK cells to mediate cytotoxicity was somewhat reduced. Therefore, we conclude that the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 signaling axis is critical for cytokine and chemokine generation, although it is dispensable for cytotoxic granule release depending on the activation state of NK cells. These results indicate that Bcl10 represents an exclusive ""molecular switch"" that links the upstream receptor-mediated signaling to cytokine and chemokine generations.	2007	11	05	J Immunol	Malarkannan	Subramaniam

17852708	10.1080/10428190701606818	Higher rates of t(11;18) in Chinese patients with transformed type of MALT lymphoma suggest novel pathways for progression of the disease.	To detect the t(11;18) chromosome translocation in different stages of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, we established a RT-PCR method by adopting three new primer pairs and using the RNA extracted from the paraffin tissues to amplify the t(11;18) fusion gene API2-MALT1 in shorter lengths. Our results showed five key findings, which are (a) higher detection rates of t(11;18) (21.13%) in Chinese patients with transformed MALT lymphoma, (b) lower detection rates of t(11;18) in stomach MALT lymphoma, (c) different organ localizations of MALT lymphoma in Chinese patients, (d) higher nuclear expression rates of Bcl-10 in low grade MALT (51.72%), and (e) lower response rates (50% CR, and 50% PR) to anti-H.-pylori therapy. These findings suggest novel pathways for low-grade MALT lymphoma to be progressed into transformed MALT lymphoma. This study also suggests that amplification of shorter length of PCR products from the paraffin-fixed tissues increases sensitivity, which is significant in improving the selection of the therapeutic regimen and assessing the prognosis of the disease.	2008	04	09	Leuk Lymphoma	Ke	Xiaoyan
17948050	10.1038/sj.emboj.7601897	Malt1 ubiquitination triggers NF-kappaB signaling upon T-cell activation.	Triggering of antigen receptors on lymphocytes is critical for initiating adaptive immune response against pathogens. T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement induces the formation of the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex that is essential for activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms that link CBM complex formation to IKK activation remain unclear. Here we report that Malt1 is polyubiquitinated upon T-cell activation. Ubiquitin chains on Malt1 provide a docking surface for the recruitment of the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO/IKKgamma. TRAF6 associates with Malt1 in response to T-cell activation and can function as an E3 ligase for Malt1 in vitro and in vivo, mediating lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of Malt1. Multiple lysine residues in the C-terminus of Malt1 serve as acceptor sites for the assembly of polyubiquitin chains. Malt1 mutants that lack C-terminal ubiquitin acceptor lysines are impaired in rescuing NF-kappaB signaling and IL-2 production in Malt1-/- T cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that induced Malt1 ubiquitination is critical for the engagement of CBM and IKK complexes, thereby directing TCR signals to the canonical NF-kappaB pathway.	2007	12	17	EMBO J	Oeckinghaus	Andrea
18040143	10.3960/jslrt.47.31	MALT lymphoma : recent advances in aetiology and molecular genetics.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a common low grade B-cell lymphoma arising from a background of chronic inflammatory disease at a number of mucosal sites. Those originating in the stomach are causatively linked to Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication of the bacterium with antibiotics leads to long-term complete regression of the lymphoma in aproximately 70% of cases. Now, there is further evidence of linking Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi and Chlamydia psittaci infection with immunoproliferative small intestine disease, MALT lymphoma of the skin and ocular adnexa respectively. t(11;18)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)/IGH-BCL10, t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 and t(3;14)/IGH-FOXP1 occur at considerably variable incidences in MALT lymphomas of different sites. The first three chromosome translocations are specifically associated with the MALT lymphoma entity and the oncogenic products of these translocations have been shown to target a common molecular pathway, i.e. the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. Here, I review the recent advances in our understanding of the association of microbial pathogens with MALT lymphoma of various sites and the molecular genetics underlying the lymphoma development.	2008	02	01	J Clin Exp Hematop	Du	Ming-Qing
18086859	10.1084/jem.20070379	IkappaB kinase beta-induced phosphorylation of CARMA1 contributes to CARMA1 Bcl10 MALT1 complex formation in B cells.	Protein kinase C (PKC) beta has been reported (Shinohara, H., T. Yasuda, Y. Aiba, H. Sanjo, M. Hamadate, H. Watarai, H. Sakurai, and T. Kurosaki. 2005. J. Exp. Med. 202:1423-1431; Sommer, K., B.

Immunity. 23:561-574) to play a crucial role in B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation through phosphorylation of caspase recruitment domain 11, Bimp3 (CARMA1). However, it remains unclear whether this PKCbeta-mediated phosphorylation accounts fully for the activation status of CARMA1, because involvement of other kinases, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent kinase 1, has also been suggested. We show that PKCbeta mediates phosphorylation of CARMA1 on Ser668, which in turn is essential for BCR-mediated CARMA1-Bcl10-mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) association and subsequent IKK activation. Our analyses also demonstrate that the downstream kinase IKKbeta contributes to facilitating formation of the complex CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 by mediating phosphorylation of CARMA1. Hence, our data suggest that PKCbeta is crucial for initial activation of IKK. The activated IKKbeta does not merely function as an effector enzyme but also modifies the upstream signaling complex through a feedback mechanism, thereby optimizing the strength and duration of the nuclear factor kappaB signal.	2008	01	07	J Exp Med	Shinohara	Hisaaki
18307876		[Clonal relationship between transformed and non-transformed components in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma].	To analyze the clonal relationship between transformed and non-transformed components in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Six cases of MALT lymphoma with high-grade transformation were studied. Immunohistochemical study was carried out by EliVision using bcl-10 antibody. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of API2-MALT1 fusion gene transcripts. The target cells were selected by laser microdissection and studied by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis for rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. In the 6 cases of MALT lymphoma with high-grade transformation, nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of bcl-10 was demonstrated in 1 case, while API2-MALT1 fusion gene was present in 2 cases. Identical fragments of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were detected in both transformed and non-transformed components in each of the 6 cases, except for the differences at 2 nucleotide positions in N or D regions in 2 cases. The tumor cells from both transformed and non-transformed components in MALT lymphoma derive from the same clone.	2009	04	21	Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi	Jiang	Wei
18307945		[Significance of detection of Bcl-10 novel mutation in ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma].	To examine the expression of Bc1-10 gene in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, atypical lymphatic hyperplasia and reactive lymphatic hyperplasia; as well as to discover novel mutations and their role in clinical diagnosis and pathogenesis of ocular adnexal lymphatic disorders. Thirty-one specimens of ocular adnexal lymphoma were obtained from the department of ophthalmology of Shanghai Changzheng hospital, second military medical university during surgery and were preserved in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting. The expression of Bc1-10 gene in ocular adnexal specimens was examined by molecular biological methods. The DNA sequences were analyzed by Sanger method and the results were compared with those of the Gene Bank blast to identify novel mutations. The protein expression of mutant Bc1-10 and NF-kappaB in these specimens were detected by immunohistological method and immunofluorescence. Confocal microscope was used to observe the colocalization of Bc1-10 and NF-kappaB expressions. Of the 31 specimens, 14 were positive for Bc1-10, of which 10 showed novel mutations of Bc1-10. One of the four atypical lymphatic hyperplasia specimens was positive for Bc1-10, this mutation was reported by others previously. One of the four reactive lymphatic hyperplasia specimens was positive for Bc1-10. Fourteen (60.8%) of the 23 MALT lymphoma specimens were positive for aberration of Bc1-10, including 6 cases with nuclear expression at moderate intensity and 8 cases with expression in the cytoplasm at weak to moderate intensities. Mutations of Bcl-10 were also expressed in the cytoplasm at moderate intensity in two cases with atypical lymphatic hyperplasia and expressed at moderate intensity in one case with reactive lymphatic hyperplasia. I kappa alpha was expressed diffusely in the cytoplasm in 20 cases, among which co-expression of I kappa alpha and Bcl-10 was present in 14 cases. Novel mutation of Bc1-10 gene in ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma is detected in Chinese patients. Detection of genetic mutation is consistent with and more sensitive than the pathological diagnosis. It can be used to identify the stage and the quality of the disease even no morphological changes are present for discrimination. It can be used as a sensitive index for early diagnosis.	2010	11	04	Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi	Zhu	Jing
18346354		[Abnormal expression of bcl-10 protein in extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma type].	To evaluate the diagnostic role of nuclear expression of bcl-10 protein in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. One hundred and forty cases of MALT lymphoma were collected from Cancer Hospital of Fudan University (including 38 cases from stomach, 35 cases from ocular adnexa, 16 cases from intestine, 15 cases from skin, 15 cases from salivary gland, 14 cases from lung, 3 cases from thyroid and 4 cases from other sites). Ten cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia of tonsil, 5 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of orbit and 143 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma other than MALT lymphoma (including 20 cases of NK/T cell lymphoma, 20 cases of follicular lymphomas, 20 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphomas, 20 cases of nodal diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 10 cases of gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 13 cases of nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 12 cases of mantle cell lymphoma, 11 cases of splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 6 cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, 3 cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma, 1 case of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and 1 case of plasmacytoma were used as controls. Immunohistochemical study for bcl-10, as well as dual staining with CD20, was performed by EnVision method in paraffin sections. In reactive follicular hyperplasia of tonsil, bcl-10 was moderately or strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells, while the mantle cells were negative and the marginal zone cells and paracortical T cells showed weak staining. In the 5 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of orbit, 2 were bcl-10-negative and the remaining 3 expressed bcl-10 in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells. As for non-MALT lymphomas, 3 gastric DLBCL showed nuclear expression. The remaining cases showed variable cytoplasmic staining. In some cases of lymphoma, bcl-10 was expressed in tumor cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells. On the other hand, 92.1% (129/140) of MALT lymphoma were bcl-10 positive. Among those cases, 54.3% (76/140) showed cytoplasmic positivity and 37.9% (53/140) showed nuclear positivity. The nuclear positivity rate of bcl-10 in different anatomic sites was different. The staining was most intense in MALT lymphoma of ocular adnexa. Dual staining with CD20 showed that the bcl-10-positive cells were also CD20-positive, though the number of bcl-10-positive cells were less than that of CD20-positive cells. Bcl-10 expression in lymphoid hyperplasia is a universal phenomenon. Cytoplasmic expression of bcl-10 is seen in many different kinds of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and reactive lymphoid conditions. In some cases of lymphoma, bcl-10 is expressed in tumor cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells, suggesting a possible role of abnormal bcl-10 expression in tumorgenesis. Nuclear expression of bcl-10 is seen mainly in MALT lymphoma, especially when occurring in ocular adnexa and lung. This is in contrast to loss of bcl-10 expression in residual germinal center cells.	2008	05	08	Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi	Li	Bai-Zhou

The association between four BCL10 single nucleotide polymorphisms at codons 5, 8, 162, and intron 1 and the susceptibility or progression for germ cell tumors (GCTs) was investigated in 73 testicular GCT patients and 72 controls. GCT patients with metastatic disease were more likely to have a variant type allele of the polymorphisms at codon 5 (age-adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=6.25; 95% CI=1.09-35.83; P=0.040) and codon 8 (aOR=4.63; 95% CI=1.35-15.93; P=0.015) than those with the localized disease. Therefore, BCL10 polymorphisms at codons 5 and 8 may play a role in the progression to advanced stage GCTs.	2006	10	06	Cancer Lett	Inoue	Takamitsu
16280327	10.1074/jbc.M511014200	A pathway for tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced Bcl10 nuclear translocation. Bcl10 is up-regulated by NF-kappaB and phosphorylated by Akt1 and then complexes with Bcl3 to enter the nucleus.	Bcl10 overexpression and nuclear translocation were originally identified in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with t(1;14)(p32;q32) chromosome translocation. DNA amplification of Bcl10 was also found in other solid tumors. We have recently shown that nuclear translocation of Bcl10 is a specific molecular determinant of Helicobacter pylori-independent mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (Kuo, S.-H., Chen, L. T., Yeh, K.-H., Wu, M. S., Hsu, H. C., Yeh, P. Y., Mao, T. L., Chen, C. L., Doong, S. L., Lin, J. T., and Cheng, A.-L. (2004) J. Clin. Oncol. 22, 3491-3497). However, the molecular mechanism of Bcl10 nuclear translocation remains unknown. In this study, we observed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) up-regulates the expression of Bcl10 and induces a fraction of Bcl10 nuclear translocation in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that an NF-kappaB-binding site resides in the Bcl10 5 '-untranslated region. This study also demonstrates that Akt1, activated by TNFalpha, phosphorylates Bcl10 at Ser218 and Ser231 and that phosphorylated Bcl10 subsequently complexes with Bcl3 to enter the nucleus. Either inhibition of Akt1 or depletion of Bcl3 blocks Bcl10 nuclear translocation. In summary, these findings characterize a molecular linkage that directs Bcl10 nuclear translocation in response to TNFalpha treatment.	2006	02	28	J Biol Chem	Yeh	Pei Yen
16323006	10.1007/s00428-005-0122-0	Ocular adnexal marginal zone B cell lymphoma: a clinical and pathologic study of 23 cases.	To better characterize ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MZL-MALT), we analyzed the clinical and pathologic features of 23 patients (11 men, 12 women, median age 66 years). The tumor was confined to one ocular structure in 18 cases (conjunctiva, n=8; orbit, n=8; or lacrimal gland, n=2). Concurrent extraorbital disease was detected by the staging procedure in five patients, and preferentially involved other MALT sites. Histogenetic B cell marker studies, available in 13 cases, showed an early post-germinal center (GC) phenotype (BCL-6(-)/IRF4(+)/CD138(-)) (n=5) or a late post-GC phenotype (BCL-6(-)/IRF4(+)/CD138(+)) (n=8), which could be helpful for discrimination from other types of small-B cell lymphoma. BCL10 was positive in 12 of 13 patients tested, with nuclear (n=4) or cytoplasmic (n=8) immunoreactivity. These staining patterns ruled out t(1;14)(p22;q32) translocation. T(11;18)(q21;q21), another MZL-MALT-specific translocation, was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in four of 15 patients tested. Clinical outcome was excellent but the overall relapse rate was 26.1% with a median follow-up of 39 months (range 6-132 months). Regardless of the disease stage at diagnosis, combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy seemed to be more effective than chemotherapy alone in ocular adnexal MZL-MALT, as persistent complete remission was achieved in nine patients receiving combination therapy, while six of 14 patients treated with chemotherapy alone relapsed.	2007	08	28	Virchows Arch	Charlotte	Frédéric
16341151	10.1038/modpathol.3800523	MALT1 and BCL10 aberrations in MALT lymphomas and their effect on the expression of BCL10 in the tumour cells.	Among the genetic abnormalities reported to occur in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, the three translocations t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) are of particular interest because they appear to be specific for, or at least closely related to this type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These translocations affect the MALT1 (18q21) and BCL10 (1p22) genes. We retrieved 77 consecutive biopsies of MALT lymphomas (documented with frozen material) over a 10-year period and investigated these cases for the presence of these three translocations with fluorescence in situ hybridisation, along with the immunohistochemical analysis of the intracellular localisation of the BCL10 protein. The above-listed translocations occurred mutually exclusive and were detected in 10, 1 and 3% of the cases, respectively (the latter incidence being much lower than in the previously reported studies by one single group). These genetic rearrangements corresponded well with the aberrant subcellular localisation of the BCL10 protein as found by immunohistochemistry: t(11;18)(q21;q21) and (1;14)(p22;q32) were marked by a, respectively, moderate to strong nuclear BCL10 staining pattern while t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas were characterised by a perinuclear BCL10 staining pattern. This study further supports the close interaction between the MALT1 and BCL10 proteins in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas and may indicate that BCL10 immunohistochemistry is a simple technique to identify those MALT lymphoma cases with an underlying genetic aberration.	2006	03	21	Mod Pathol	Sagaert	Xavier

16395405	10.1172/JCI25641	cIAP2 is a ubiquitin protein ligase for BCL10 and is dysregulated in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas.	The pathogenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas is associated with independent chromosomal translocations that lead to the upregulation of either BCL10 or MALT1 or the generation of a fusion protein, cIAP2-MALT1. While both BCL10 and MALT1 are critically involved in antigen receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation, the role of cIAP2 is not clear. Here we show that cIAP2 is a ubiquitin ligase (E3) of BCL10 and targets it for degradation, inhibiting antigen receptor-mediated cytokine production. cIAP2-MALT1 lacks E3 activity, and concomitantly, the BCL10 protein is stabilized in MALT lymphomas harboring this fusion. Furthermore, BCL10 and cIAP2-MALT1 synergistically activate NF-kappaB. These results reveal cIAP2 as an inhibitor of antigenic signaling and implicate its dysfunction in MALT lymphomas.	2006	03	02	J Clin Invest	Hu	Shimin
16432253	10.1084/jem.20051982	The Bcl10-Malt1 complex segregates Fc epsilon RI-mediated nuclear factor kappa B activation and cytokine production from mast cell degranulation.	Mast cells are pivotal effector cells in IgE-mediated allergic inflammatory diseases. Central for mast cell activation are signals from the IgE receptor FcepsilonRI, which induce cell degranulation with the release of preformed mediators and de novo synthesis of proinflammatory leukotrienes and cytokines. How these individual mast cell responses are differentially controlled is still unresolved. We identify B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (Malt1) as novel key regulators of mast cell signaling. Mice deficient for either protein display severely impaired IgE-dependent late phase anaphylactic reactions. Mast cells from these animals neither activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) nor produce tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin 6 upon FcepsilonRI ligation even though proximal signaling, degranulation, and leukotriene secretion are normal. Thus, Bcl10 and Malt1 are essential positive mediators of FcepsilonRI-dependent mast cell activation that selectively uncouple NF-kappaB-induced proinflammatory cytokine production from degranulation and leukotriene synthesis.	2006	04	03	J Exp Med	Klemm	Stefanie
16495340	10.1091/mbc.e05-10-0985	POLKADOTS are foci of functional interactions in T-Cell receptor-mediated signaling to NF-kappaB.	Stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) results in the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-kappaB, that are crucial for T-cell proliferation and gain of effector functions. On TCR engagement, several proteins within the TCR-directed NF-kappaB signaling pathway undergo dynamic spatial redistribution, but the significance of these redistribution events is largely unknown. We have previously described TCR-induced cytoplasmic structures called POLKADOTS (punctate and oligomeric killing or activating domains transducing signals) that are enriched in the NF-kappaB signaling intermediate, Bcl10. We now show that these structures are formed only under conditions that promote efficient NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, POLKADOTS formation is dependent on functional domains of specific NF-kappaB signal transducers. Through use of a photoactivatable GFP, we demonstrate that POLKADOTS contain both a highly stable and a rapidly equilibrating protein component. FRET analyses show that POLKADOTS are sites of enriched interactions between Bcl10 and partner signaling proteins. These observations strongly suggest that POLKADOTS are focal sites of dynamic information exchange between cytosolic intermediates in the process of TCR activation of NF-kappaB.	2006	08	08	Mol Biol Cell	Rossman	Jeremy S

Many details of the generic pathway for induction of NF-kappaB have been delineated, but it is still not clear how multiple, diverse receptor systems are able to converge on this evolutionarily conserved family of transcription factors. Recent studies have shown that the CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins are critical for coupling the common elements of the NF-kappaB pathway to the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. We previously demonstrated a role for the serine/threonine kinase Akt in CD28-mediated NF-kappaB induction. Using a CARMA1-deficient T-cell line, we have now found that the CARMA complex is required for induction of NF-kappaB by Akt, in cooperation with protein kinase C activation. Furthermore, using a novel selective inhibitor of Akt, we confirm that Akt plays a modulatory role in NF-kappaB induction by the TCR and CD28. Finally, we provide evidence for a physical and functional interaction between Akt and CARMA and for Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl10. Therefore, in T cells, Akt impinges upon NF-kappaB signaling through at least two separate mechanisms.	2006	06	20	Mol Cell Biol	Narayan	Preeti
16512826	10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.05969.x	Distinct comparative genomic hybridisation profiles in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas with and without t(11;18)(q21;q21).	t(11;18)(q21;q21) occurs specifically in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and the translocation generates a functional API2-MALT1 fusion product that activates nuclear factor (NF)kappaB. t(11;18) positive lymphomas usually lack the chromosomal aberrations and microsatellite alterations frequently seen in the translocation-negative MALT lymphomas. To further understand their genetic differences, we investigated gastric MALT lymphomas with and without t(11;18) by comparative genomic hybridisation. In general, both chromosomal gains and losses were far more frequent in t(11;18)-negative (median = 3.4 imbalances) than t(11;18)-positive cases (median = 1.6 imbalances), with gains being more frequent than losses. Recurrent chromosomal gains involving whole or major parts of a chromosome were seen for chromosomes 3, 12, 18 and 22 (23%, 19%, 19% and 27% respectively). Discrete recurrent chromosomal gains were found at 9q34 (11/26 = 42%). Bioinformatic analysis of genes mapping to 9q34 revealed potential targets. Among them, TRAF2 and CARD9 are known interaction partners of BCL10, playing a role in NFkappaB activation. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridisation confirmed genomic gain of the TRAF2, CARD9 and MALT1 loci in 5/6 and 2/2 cases showing chromosomal gains at 9q34 and 18q21 respectively. The results further highlight the genetic difference between MALT lymphomas with and without t(11;18). Moreover, our findings suggest that genomic gain of genes that modulate NFkappaB activation, such as MALT1, TRAF2 and CARD9, may play a role in the pathogenesis of the translocation-negative MALT lymphoma.	2006	05	03	Br J Haematol	Zhou	Yuanping
16572121	10.1038/nature04687	A loss-of-function RNA interference screen for molecular targets in cancer.	The pursuit of novel therapeutic agents in cancer relies on the identification and validation of molecular targets. Hallmarks of cancer include self-sufficiency in growth signals and evasion from apoptosis; genes that regulate these processes may be optimal for therapeutic attack. Here we describe a loss-of-function screen for genes required for the proliferation and survival of cancer cells using an RNA interference library. We used a doxycycline-inducible retroviral vector for the expression of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to construct a library targeting 2,500 human genes. We used retroviral pools from this library to infect cell lines representing two distinct molecular subgroups of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), termed activated B-cell-like DLBCL and germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL. Each vector was engineered to contain a unique 60-base-pair 'bar code', allowing the abundance of an individual shRNA vector within a population of transduced cells to be measured using microarrays of the bar-code sequences. We observed that a subset of shRNA vectors was depleted from the transduced cells after three weeks in culture only if shRNA expression was induced. In activated B-cell-like DLBCL cells, but not germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL cells, shRNAs targeting the NF-kappaB pathway were depleted, in keeping with the essential role of this pathway in the survival of activated B-cell-like DLBCL. This screen uncovered CARD11 as a key upstream signalling component responsible for the constitutive IkappaB kinase activity in activated B-cell-like DLBCL. The methodology that we describe can be used to establish a functional taxonomy of cancer and help reveal new classes of therapeutic targets distinct from known oncogenes.	2006	05	31	Nature	Ngo	Vu N
16572204	10.1038/sj.leu.2404192	Molecular pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma: two signaling pathways underlying the antiapoptotic effect of API2-MALT1 fusion protein.	At least three recurrent chromosomal translocations, t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), t(14;18)(q32;q21), involving the API2-MALT1 fusion protein, BCL10 and MALT1, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Several lines of evidence indicated that both BCL10 and MALT1 are required for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation by antigen receptor stimulation in lymphocytes, and API2-MALT1 can bypass this BCL10/MALT1 signaling pathway. Nuclear factor kappa B activation may contribute to antiapoptotic effect through NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes. We recently demonstrated that API2-MALT1 can induce transactivation of the API2 gene through NF-kappaB activation, thus highlighting a positive feedback-loop mechanism of self-activation by upregulating its own expression in t(11;18) MALT lymphomas. We also demonstrated that API2-MALT1 possesses an antiapoptotic effect, in part, through its direct interaction with apoptotic regulators. These findings therefore led us to hypothesize that the antiapoptotic effect by API2-MALT1 may be mediated by its interaction with apoptotic regulators, on the one hand, and by NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes on the other. We also found that BCL10 and MALT1 are shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm, and that MALT1 can regulate the subcellular location of BCL10.	2006	10	30	Leukemia	Nakagawa	M
16636337	10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6150	Forkhead box protein P1 expression in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas predicts poor prognosis and transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Gene expression profiling studies have reported upregulated mRNA expression of forkhead box protein P1 (FOXP1) in response to normal B-cell activation and high expression in a poor prognosis subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Recently, it was also found that FOXP1 rearrangements and expression of its protein occur in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. In this study, we investigated FOXP1 expression in its relationship to morphology, genetic features, and prognosis in a series of 70 MALT lymphomas. All samples were morphologically reviewed and stained for FOXP1. Presence of structural and/or numeric aberrations of the FOXP1, BCL10, and MALT1 genes was investigated. For all patients, a complete clinical data set was collected. We detected nuclear expression of FOXP1 in 20 of the 70 MALT lymphomas (nine of them featuring structural or numeric aberrations of the FOXP1 locus). FOXP1 positivity was confined to MALT lymphomas with poor clinical outcome (with impact of FOXP1 expression on relapse rate and disease-free survival). It was also found that MALT lymphomas with strong FOXP1 expression are at risk of transforming into an aggressive DLBCL of nongerminal center phenotype if they feature, in addition, a polymorphic histology and the presence of trisomy 3 and 18. The data presented show that FOXP1 expression is an independent prognostic factor in MALT lymphomas. The data also support the hypothesis that a subgroup of nongerminal center DLBCLs (those marked by FOXP1 expression and trisomy 3 and 18) might represent a large-cell variant of MALT lymphomas.	2006	06	12	J Clin Oncol	Sagaert	Xavier
16636680	10.1038/modpathol.3800609	Nuclear BCL-10 expression is common in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia and does not correlate with p65 NF-kappaB activation.	B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL-10) is expressed in the cytoplasm of normal germinal center and marginal zone B-cells and is involved in lymphocyte development and activation. Aberrant nuclear expression of BCL-10 occurs in a subset of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MALT lymphomas), primarily those with the t(1;14)(p22;q32) or t(11;18)(q21;q21). Little is known about BCL-10 expression in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM). We assessed for BCL-10 in 51 bone marrow (BM) specimens involved by LPL/WM using immunohistochemical methods. All patients had monoclonal IgM in serum. Extent of BM involvement was assessed using PAX-5/BSAP and CD20 immunostains and the pattern and percentage of B-cells positive for BCL-10 was determined. The p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), a molecule downstream of BCL-10, was also assessed immunohistochemically. Nuclear BCL-10 staining was present in 28/51 (55%) specimens. BCL-10 expression correlated with greater extent of BM involvement (P=0.001), but did not correlate with serum IgM paraprotein levels, type of immunoglobulin light chain, or clinical variables. Nuclear expression of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was detected in 17/50 (34%) specimens, suggesting that NF-kappaB is active in a subset of LPL/WM. p65 NF-kappaB activation did not correlate with nuclear BCL-10 immunostaining. Cytogenetic analysis in 29 cases showed no evidence of the t(1;14) or t(11;18). These results indicate that nuclear BCL-10 expression is common in LPL/WM and does not correlate with MALT lymphoma-associated translocations or p65 NF-kappaB nuclear staining.	2007	08	08	Mod Pathol	Merzianu	Mihai
16648871	10.1038/modpathol.3800597	Nuclear bcl10 expression characterizes a group of ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas with shorter failure-free survival.	Ocular adnexa B-cell lymphomas are a relatively rare group of extranodal lymphomas, marginal-zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphomas) being the most frequent type at this location. As with other nongastrointestinal MALT lymphomas, ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas have distinct characteristics from those of the gastric MALT model, implying specific pathogenic events, which could be of interest in the prediction of clinical behavior and the choice between therapeutic options. In a series of 39 cases of ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas, studied using a tissue microarray, we observed that the most frequent alteration was related to apoptosis regulation. Thus, caspase 3 activity was completely abolished, and phosphorylated IkappaBalpha, a marker of NF-kappaB activation, showed increased expression, while cases with an increased number of large cells displayed increased expression of survivin and other cell-cycle-related proteins, such as cyclin A, cyclin E and Ki67, and p16 expression was reduced. There were no occurrences of t(11;18)(q21,q21), while 5/37 cases exhibited t(14;18)(q32;q21). Aberrant nuclear expression of bcl10 was observed in 11 cases, independently of the presence of translocations, and was significantly associated with phosphorylated IkappaBalpha expression and a reduced TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nicked-end labeling apoptotic index. Moreover, patients with tumoral bcl10 nuclear expression showed shorter failure-free survival.	2006	09	21	Mod Pathol	Franco	Renato

16775419	10.4161/cc.5.13.2866	CIAP2 inhibits anigen receptor signaling by targeting Bcl10 for degredation.	The cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) is a RING-containing protein ubiquitin ligase. In a high percentage of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, cIAP2 is fused to MALT1/paracaspase as a result of the t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation. The physiological function of cIAP2 in lymphocytes and how this function may be affected by the translocation are not well understood. We have shown that cIAP2 normally inhibits antigen receptor signaling by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of Bcl10, a critical component for antigenic signaling to NF-kappaB. The cIAP2-MALT1 fusion protein lacks this E3 activity and is incapable of ubiquitinating Bcl10, likely causing enhanced Bcl10 expression. Furthermore, cIAP2-MALT1 and Bcl10 synergistically activate NF-kappaB. These results reveal a physiological function of cIAP2, identify Bcl10 upregulation as a unifying molecular mechanism for MALT lymphomas, and define the mechanism and effects of this upregulation in t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphomas.	2006	12	27	Cell Cycle	Hu	Shimin

16784987	10.1016/j.humpath.2006.02.012	Aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression and lack of t(11;18)(q21;q21) in primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.	Inhibition of apoptosis seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of marginal zone lymphoma. Apoptosis regulator B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) may show aberrant nuclear localization in some aggressive extracutaneous MALT lymphomas, often in association with a MALT1 gene t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation. The possible occurrence of this association in primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) remains insufficiently explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate BCL10 protein expression pattern and its possible relationship to the presence of t(11;18)(q21;q21) and other MALT1 gene abnormalities in PCMZL and to assess their clinical significance. The study included 42 consecutive PCMZL patients diagnosed on the basis of the World Health Organization/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer classification criteria. BCL10 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in all cases, whereas t(11;18)(q21;q21) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed on 21 samples. In addition, the presence of other MALT1 gene translocations was explored in 26 samples by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization using a MALT1 locus-specific probe. We observed the presence of aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression in a significant number of PCMZL cases (36%, 15/42). This aberrant expression was significantly related to the development of extracutaneous disease. In contrast, neither the t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation nor other MALT1 gene translocations could be demonstrated. t(11;18)(q21;q21), strongly linked to extracutaneous MALT lymphomas, does not seem to play a role in PCMZL. The participation of other MALT1 gene translocations in PCMZL pathogenesis seems also unlikely.	2006	08	04	Hum Pathol	Gallardo	Fernando

16799010	10.1167/iovs.05-1312	Detection of the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation and proto-oncogene expression in primary intraocular lymphoma.	Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma that initially infiltrates the retina, vitreous, or optic nerve head, with or without central nervous system involvement. This study examined the expression of the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation, the bcl-10 gene, and high expression of bcl-6 mRNA in PIOL cells. Microdissection and PCR analysis were used to examine vitreous specimens in patients with PIOL for the presence of bcl-2 t(14;18) translocations, the bcl-10 gene, and expression of bcl-6 mRNA. A medical record review was also conducted to determine whether the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation correlated with prognosis. Forty of 72 (55%) PIOL patients expressed the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation at the major breakpoint region. Fifteen of 68 (22%) patients expressed the translocation at the minor cluster region. The bcl-10 gene was detected in 6 of 26 (23%) patients, whereas 4 of 4 (100%) PIOL patients expressed higher levels of bcl-6 mRNA compared with inflammatory lymphocytes. An analysis of clinical outcome in 23 PIOL patients revealed no significant association between bcl-2 t(14;18) translocations and survival or relapse. However, patients with the translocation were significantly younger. PIOL has unique molecular patterns of bcl-2, bcl-10, and bcl-6 when compared with other systemic lymphomas. This study lays the foundation for future studies aimed at exploring the genotypic classification of PIOL based on the quantitative molecular framework of gene expression profiling, with the goal of providing useful adjuncts to the pathologic diagnosis of this complex disease.	2006	08	07	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	Wallace	Dana J
16809782	10.1128/MCB.02469-05	Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is a modulator of CARMA1-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	CARMA1 is a central regulator of NF-kappaB activation in lymphocytes. CARMA1 and Bcl10 functionally interact and control NF-kappaB signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR). Computational analysis of expression neighborhoods of CARMA1-Bcl10MALT 1 for enrichment in kinases identified calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) as an important component of this pathway. Here we report that Ca(2+)/CaMKII is redistributed to the immune synapse following T-cell activation and that CaMKII is critical for NF-kappaB activation induced by TCR stimulation. Furthermore, CaMKII enhances CARMA1-induced NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, we have shown that CaMKII phosphorylates CARMA1 on Ser109 and that the phosphorylation facilitates the interaction between CARMA1 and Bcl10. These results provide a novel function for CaMKII in TCR signaling and CARMA1-induced NF-kappaB activation.	2006	08	11	Mol Cell Biol	Ishiguro	Kazuhiro
16818229	10.1016/j.molcel.2006.05.027	Essential role for IkappaB kinase beta in remodeling Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complexes upon T cell activation.	T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB is controlled by PKCtheta-dependent activation of the Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1 (CBM) complex. Antigen-induced phosphorylation of Bcl10 has been reported, but its physiological function is unknown. Here we show that the putative downstream kinase IKKbeta is required for initial CBM complex formation. Further, upon engagement of IKKbeta/Malt1/Bcl10 with Carma1, IKKbeta phosphorylates Bcl10 in the C terminus and thereby interferes with Bcl10/Malt1 association and Bcl10-mediated IKKgamma ubiquitination. Mutation of the IKKbeta phosphorylation sites on Bcl10 enhances expression of NF-kappaB target genes IL-2 and TNFalpha after activation of primary T cells. Thus, our data provide evidence that IKKbeta serves a dual role upstream of its classical substrates, the IkappaB proteins. While being essential for triggering initial CBM complex formation, IKKbeta-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl10 exhibits a negative regulatory role in T cell activation.	2006	08	21	Mol Cell	Wegener	Elmar
16830336	10.1002/gcc.20352	Quantitative microsatellite analysis to delineate the commonly deleted region 1p22.3 in mantle cell lymphomas.	The molecular pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), a subset of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with a poor prognosis, is still poorly understood. In addition to the characteristic primary genetic alteration t(11;14)(q13;q32), several further genetic changes are present in most cases. One of the most frequent genomic imbalances is the deletion of 1p22.1-p31.1 observed in nearly one-third of MCL cases. This might indicate the presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) in this critical region of deletion. Quantitative microsatellite analysis (QuMA) is a real-time PCR-based method to detect DNA copy number changes. Since QuMA has the resolving power to detect subtle genomic alterations, including homozygous deletions, this may help to identify candidate tumor suppressor genes from deleted regions. To gain more insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MCL, QuMA was performed on genomic DNA from 57 MCL cases. Eight microsatellite loci mapping to the chromosomal region 1p22.3 were analyzed. Losses were observed in 51 of the 57 ( approximately 89.5%) samples. Two cases showed a homozygous deletion at the locus containing the gene SH3GLB1, which plays a key role in Bax-mediated apoptosis. Two hotspots with copy number losses were detected at chromosomal localizations 85.4 and 86.6 Mb encompassing BCL10 and CLCA2. Both the genes seem to be attractive candidates to study tumor suppressor function in MCL.	2006	10	03	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	Balakrishnan	Asha
16831874	10.1074/jbc.M513057200	The IRAK-1-BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6-TAK1 cascade mediates signaling to NF-kappaB from Toll-like receptor 4.	Our previous studies have revealed that the signaling protein BCL10 plays a major role in adaptive immunity by mediating NF-kappaB activation in the LPS/TLR4 pathway. In this study, we show that IRAK-1 acts as the essential upstream adaptor that recruits BCL10 to the TLR4 signaling complex and mediates signaling to NF-kappaB through the BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6-TAK1 cascade. Following dissociation from IRAK-1, BCL10 is translocated into the cytosol along with TRAF6 and TAK1, in a process bridged by a direct BCL10-Pellino2 interaction. RNA interference against MALT1 markedly reduced the level of NF-kappaB activation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages, which suggests that MALT1 plays a major role in the LPS/TLR4 pathway. MALT1 interacted with BCL10 and TRAF6 to facilitate TRAF6 self-ubiquitination in the cytosol, which was strictly dependent on the dissociation of BCL10 from IRAK-1. We show that BCL10 oligomerization is a prerequisite for BCL10 function in LPS signaling to NF-kappaB and that IRAK-1 dimerization is an important event in this process.	2006	12	18	J Biol Chem	Dong	Wei
16862125	10.1038/nature04926	Card9 controls a non-TLR signalling pathway for innate anti-fungal immunity.	Fungal infections are increasing worldwide due to the marked rise in immunodeficiencies including AIDS; however, immune responses to fungi are poorly understood. Dectin-1 is the major mammalian pattern recognition receptor for the fungal component zymosan. Dectin-1 represents the prototype of innate non-Toll-like receptors (TLRs) containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) related to those of adaptive antigen receptors. Here we identify Card9 as a key transducer of Dectin-1 signalling. Although being dispensable for TLR/MyD88-induced responses, Card9 controls Dectin-1-mediated myeloid cell activation, cytokine production and innate anti-fungal immunity. Card9 couples to Bcl10 and regulates Bcl10-Malt1-mediated NF-kappaB activation induced by zymosan. Yet, Card9 is dispensable for antigen receptor signalling that uses Carma1 as a link to Bcl10-Malt1. Thus, our results define a novel innate immune pathway and indicate that evolutionarily distinct ITAM receptors in innate and adaptive immune cells use diverse adaptor proteins to engage selectively the conserved Bcl10-Malt1 module.	2006	09	11	Nature	Gross	Olaf
16863911	10.1016/j.exphem.2006.06.003	The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 releases a subset of G-CSF-primed peripheral blood progenitor cells with specific gene expression characteristics.	AMD3100 is a new CXCR4 antagonist that induces a rapid release of hematopoietic progenitors from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. We conducted a clinical study where patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with AMD3100 (A) to increase the number of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) when given a mobilization regimen of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, G). Because experimental data suggest that A+G-mobilized PBPCs are functionally different from G-mobilized PBPCs, we were interested in an intraindividual comparison of the gene expression profile of CD34+ cells in the two different settings. To this end peripheral blood CD34+ cells of three patients (three G, three A+G samples) were isolated by immunomagnetic followed by flow cytometric sorting to a purity of &gt;99%. Total RNA was purified. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 and the software package Micro Array Solutions 1.3 (SAS Institute Inc.). We found a pattern of unanimously higher (81 genes, log2 ratio &gt; 0.5; p &lt; 0.0001) or lower (29 genes, log2 ratio &lt; -0.4; p &lt; 0.0001) expressed genes in the A+G-mobilized vs G-mobilized CD34+ PBPCs. Significant changes of four selected genes noted in the microarray analysis were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genes were grouped according to gene function. Only increased expression was found in the categories antiapoptosis (e.g., MPO, HSPA1B), cell cycle (e.g., MS4A3, RRM2), replication/DNA repair (e.g., MPO, HSPA1B), cell motility (e.g., TNFSF4, HMMR), and oxygen transport. Decreased expression occurred in the proapoptosis gene group (e.g., MDA5, BCL10). CXCR4 receptor gene expression itself was significantly 1.5-fold higher in the A+G vs G group. We conclude that A+G-mobilized CD34+ PBPCs express significantly higher amounts of genes that potentially promote superior engraftment after myeloablative therapy than G-mobilized CD34+ PBPCs.	2006	08	31	Exp Hematol	Fruehauf	Stefan
16917511	10.1038/modpathol.3800668	MALT1 gene rearrangements and NF-kappaB activation involving p65 and p50 are absent or rare in primary MALT lymphomas of the breast.	Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas arising in the breast are uncommon and few cases have been assessed for MALT lymphoma-associated translocations, BCL-10 expression, or NF-kappaB activation. In this study, we analyzed eight cases of primary breast MALT lymphoma. We also included 14 cases of primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma since some of these may represent transformation of MALT lymphoma, known to occur at extra-mammary MALT sites. All cases were assessed for MALT1 gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using immunohistochemical methods, all cases were assessed for BCL-10, and subsets were assessed for NF-kappaB p65 and p50. None of the cases had MALT1 gene rearrangements by FISH. Of eight MALT lymphomas, BCL-10 was positive in seven (88%), with moderate nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in six, and a weak cytoplasmic staining in one. NF-kappaB p65 (n=8) and p50 (n=5) were negative or showed only cytoplasmic staining (ie inactivated) in all cases. Of 14 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases, BCL-10 was positive in 12 (87%), with weak-to-moderate cytoplasmic staining in 10, weak cytoplasmic and focally nuclear staining in one, and a moderate-to-strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in one. NF-kappaB p65 (n=11) showed cytoplasmic staining in all cases, whereas p50 (n=8) showed nuclear positivity (ie activated) in two (25%) cases. We conclude that MALT1 gene rearrangements are absent or rare in primary breast MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In MALT lymphomas, the moderate BCL-10 nuclear expression in six neoplasms is inconsistent with the FISH results, suggesting that BCL-10 immunostaining overestimates the frequency of MALT1 gene rearrangements. We also could not demonstrate NF-kappaB activation using nuclear staining for p65 and p50. In contrast, breast diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are heterogeneous. Weak cytoplasmic BCL-10 staining in most cases and evidence of NF-kappaB p50 activation in a subset differs from breast MALT lymphomas.	2007	01	05	Mod Pathol	Talwalkar	Sameer S
16920630	10.1016/j.cub.2006.06.062	Caspase-8 regulation by direct interaction with TRAF6 in T cell receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation.	Triggering of lymphocyte antigen receptors is the critical first step in the adaptive immune response against pathogens. T cell receptor (TCR) ligation assembles a large membrane signalosome, culminating in NF-kappaB activation [1,2]. Recently, caspase-8 was found to play a surprisingly prominent role in lymphocyte activation in addition to its well-known role in apoptosis [3]. Caspase-8 is activated after TCR stimulation and nucleates a complex with B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10), paracaspase MALT1, and the inhibitors of kappaB kinase (IKK) complex [4]. We now report that the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 binds to active caspase-8 upon TCR stimulation and facilitates its movement into lipid rafts. We identified in silico two putative TRAF6 binding motifs in the caspase-8 sequence and found that mutation of critical residues within these sites abolished TRAF6 binding and diminished TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, RNAi-mediated silencing of TRAF6 abrogated caspase-8 recruitment to the lipid rafts. Protein kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta), CARMA1, and BCL10 are also required for TCR-induced caspase-8 relocation, but only PKCtheta and BCL10 control caspase-8 activation. Our results suggest that PKCtheta independently controls CARMA1 phosphorylation and BCL10-dependent caspase-8 activation and unveil an essential role for TRAF6 as a critical adaptor linking these two convergent signaling events.	2006	11	20	Curr Biol	Bidère	Nicolas
17043017		CARMA1 and chromosomal translocations in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT type or diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	We analyzed the configuration of the CARMA1 gene, encoding a protein that closely interacts with BCL10 and MALT1, in a series of 120 extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT-type and 35 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Our study suggests that CARMA1 is not targeted by chromosomal translocations in these lymphoma entities.	2007	01	08	Haematologica	Adam	Patrick
17073595	10.2174/138945006778559256	The Bcl10/Malt1 signaling pathway as a drug target in lymphoma.	The development of lymphomas and leukemias is frequently caused by chromosomal translocations that deregulate cellular pathways of differentiation, proliferation or survival. The molecules that are involved in these aberrations provide rational targets for selective drug therapies. Recently, several disease specific translocations have been identified in human MALT lymphoma. These aberrations either upregulate the expression of BCL10 or MALT1 or induce the formation of API2-MALT1 fusion proteins. Genetic and biochemical experiments identified BCL10 and MALT1 as central components of an oligomerization-ubiquitinylation-phosphorylation cascade that activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB in response to antigen receptor ligation. Deregulation of the signaling cascade is directly associated with antigen independent MALT lymphoma growth. Here we provide an overview of the physiological and pathological functions of BCL10/MALT1 signal transduction and discuss the potential of this pathway as a drug target.	2007	01	03	Curr Drug Targets	Jost	P
17099876	10.1002/cncr.22326	Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: a clinicopathologic and molecular study with reference to antibiotic treatment.	The majority of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma develops in Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis. Little is still known regarding the clinicopathologic features of gastric MALT lymphoma not associated with H. pylori infection. One hundred thirty-seven patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, in whom H. pylori status was evaluated using at least both serology and histology, were enrolled. Clinical, histopathologic, and molecular findings were compared between H. pylori-negative group (n = 12; 9%) and H. pylori-positive group (n = 125; 91%). t(11;18)(q21;q21) was investigated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. In cases without diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) component, H. pylori-negative lymphomas located more frequently in the proximal stomach (70%), less frequently appeared as superficial type (40%), and frequently invaded the submucosa or beyond (70%). Histologically, lymphoepithelial lesions (57%), lymphoid follicles (43%), and background mucosal atrophy (50%) in the H. pylori-negative group were less frequent than in the H. pylori-positive group (91%, 93%, and 100%, respectively). The frequencies of t(11;18)(q21;q21) (100%) and BCL10 nuclear expression (100%) in the H. pylori-negative group were significantly higher than in the H. pylori-positive group (2% and 27%, respectively). Response to antibiotic treatment was observed not only in the H. pylori-positive group (75%), but also in the H. pylori-negative group (2 of 7 patients, 29%). In cases with a DLBCL component, such differences were not observed between the 2 groups. H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma is characterized by frequent t(11;18)(q21;q21). Antibiotic treatment should be considered also for this disease, although cases with t(11;18)(q21;q21) may need additional strategies.	2007	02	12	Cancer	Nakamura	Shotaro
17122510	10.1097/01.pas.0000213275.60962.2a	The incidence and anatomic site specificity of chromosomal translocations in primary extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) in North America.	Several balanced translocations have been identified in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) but there are few data regarding their frequency in different anatomic sites or the frequency of translocations involving BCL6 or kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chain genes (IGK or IGL), particularly in patients from geographic regions other than Europe and Japan. One hundred thirty-three paraffin-embedded North American primary MALT lymphoma specimens from diverse anatomic sites were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes for API2-MALT1, IGH-MALT1, IGH-BCL10, IGH-FOXP1, IGH, +/- centromeres 3, 7, 12, and 18, and a subset (n=74) were analyzed using FISH probes for IGK, IGL, and BCL6. Translocations were mutually exclusive and were detected in 26% of cases (17% API2-MALT1, 5% IGH-MALT1, 3% IGH-unknown translocation partner, and 1% IGH-BCL10). Aneuploidy was associated with IGH-MALT1 and IGH-BCL10 but only rarely with API2-MALT1. There was striking site specificity, with API2-MALT1 showing a marked predilection for lung and intestine, and IGH-MALT1 and IGH-BCL10 occurring almost exclusively in lung. Twenty-three percent of translocation-negative primary MALT lymphomas from diverse sites showed complete/partial trisomy 18. No MALT lymphomas with translocations involving IGK, IGL, BCL6, or FOXP1 were identified. This FISH panel detected cytogenetic abnormalities in half of all MALT lymphomas, and translocations arose preferentially in MALT lymphomas of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Differences in incidence and anatomic site specificity of translocations between North American and non-North American cases may reflect geographic variability of infectious or other etiologic factors.	2007	01	04	Am J Surg Pathol	Remstein	Ellen D
17274374		[Expression of BCL-10 protein and the relationship with API2-MALT1 fusion gene in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue].	To investigate the relationship of BCL-10 protein and API2-MALT1 fusion gene in MALT lymphoma. Specimens from 86 cases of MALT lymphoma were studied by immunohistochemical staining for BCL-10. RT-PCR was used to detect the transcripts of API2-MALT1 fusion gene. In all 10 cases of Hashimoto thyroiditis only cytoplasmic BCL-10 expression in lymphoid cells was observed. In 86 MALT lymphoma cases, 42 cases (48. 8%) exhibited BCL-10 expression in both nucleus and cytoplasm. API2-MALT1 fusion gene was detected in 35 cases (40. 7%) of MALT lymphoma. BCL-10 nuclear expression was correlated with API2-MALT1 fusion gene transcript (r = 0. 374,P = 0. 000). BCL-10 nuclear expression is correlated with API2-MALT1 fusion gene expression in MALT lymphoma.	2008	02	14	Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi	Li	Lei
15598810	10.1182/blood-2004-06-2297	MALT1 and the API2-MALT1 fusion act between CD40 and IKK and confer NF-kappa B-dependent proliferative advantage and resistance against FAS-induced cell death in B cells.	The most frequently recurring translocations in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, t(11;18)(q21;q21) and t(14;18)(q32; q21), lead to formation of an API2-MALT1 fusion or IgH-mediated MALT1 overexpression. Various approaches have implicated these proteins in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappa B) signaling, but this has not been shown experimentally in human B cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that MALT1 is predominantly expressed in normal and malignant germinal center B cells, corresponding to the differentiation stage of MALT lymphoma. We expressed MALT1 and apoptosis inhibitor-2 API2/MALT1 in human B-cell lymphoma BJAB cells and found both transgenes in membrane lipid rafts along with endogenous MALT1 and 2 binding partners involved in NF-kappa B signaling, B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and CARMA1 (caspase recruitment domain [CARD]-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase [MAGUK] 1). API2-MALT1 and exogenous MALT1 increased constitutive NF-kappa B activity and enhanced I kappa B kinase (IKK) activation induced by CD40 stimulation. Both transgenes protected BJAB cells from FAS (CD95)-induced death, consistent with increases in NF-kappa B cytoprotective target gene expression, and increased their proliferation rate. Expression of a dominant-negative I kappa B alpha mutant showed that these survival and proliferative advantages are dependent on elevated constitutive NF-kappa B activity. Our findings support a model in which NF-kappa B signaling, once activated in a CD40-dependent immune response, is maintained and enhanced through deregulation of MALT1 or formation of an API2-MALT1 fusion.	2005	05	03	Blood	Ho	Liza
15682432	10.1002/path.1711	FISH analysis of MALT lymphoma-specific translocations and aneuploidy in primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma.	Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (PCMZL) share histological and clinical characteristics with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas suggesting a common pathogenesis. A number of recurrent structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations have been described in MALT lymphoma, but their incidence in PCMZL is largely unknown, as is their relation with clinical and pathological data. In this study, the incidence of t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), two different t(14;18)(q32;q21), involving either IGH/MALT1 or IGH/BCL2, and numerical aberrations of chromosomes 3, 7, 12 and 18 were analysed in 12 patients with PCMZL, with follow-up of up to 10 years. Nuclei were isolated from paraffin wax sections for dual-colour interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using various probe sets either flanking or spanning the involved genes. T(14;18)(q32;q21), with breakpoints in IGH and MALT1, was found in three cases. All three had partly monocytoid histological appearances and lacked blastic transformation. An additional trisomy of chromosome 3 was detected in one of these cases. Trisomy 18 was present in two lymphomas without monocytoid morphology. No definite correlation was seen with any clinical feature, including Borrelia serology. Neither t(11;18)(q21;q21), nor t(1;14)(p22;q32) or any other translocation involving IGH, BCL10, MALT1, BCL2 and API2, amplification or deletion of chromosomal region 11q21, 18q21, 1p22, and 14q32 was detected. These results indicate that a subgroup of PCMZL with partly monocytoid morphology is genetically related to MZL at other extranodal sites.	2005	03	02	J Pathol	Schreuder	M I
15682443	10.1002/path.1715	MALT lymphoma with t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1 is characterized by strong cytoplasmic MALT1 and BCL10 expression.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is specifically associated with t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21). t(11;18)(q21;q21) fuses the N-terminus of the API2 gene to the C-terminus of the MALT1 gene and generates a functional API2-MALT1 product. t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) bring the BCL10 and MALT1 genes respectively to the IGH locus and deregulate their expression. The oncogenic activity of the three chromosomal translocations is linked by the physiological role of BCL10 and MALT1 in antigen receptor-mediated NFkappaB activation. In this study, MALT1 and BCL10 expression was examined in normal lymphoid tissues and 423 cases of MALT lymphoma from eight sites, and their expression was correlated with the above translocations, which were detected by molecular and molecular cytogenetic methods. In normal B-cell follicles, both MALT1 and BCL10 were expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm, high in centroblasts, moderate in centrocytes and weak/negative in mantle zone B-cells. In MALT lymphoma, MALT1 and BCL10 expression varied among cases with different chromosomal translocations. In 9/9 MALT lymphomas with t(14;18)(q32;q21), tumour cells showed strong homogeneous cytoplasmic expression of both MALT1 and BCL10. In 12/12 cases with evidence of t(1;14)(p22;q32) or variants, tumour cells expressed MALT1 weakly in the cytoplasm but BCL10 strongly in the nuclei. In all 67 MALT lymphomas with t(11;18)(q21;q21), tumour cells expressed weak cytoplasmic MALT1 and moderate nuclear BCL10. In MALT lymphomas without the above translocations, both MALT1 and BCL10, in general, were expressed weakly in the cytoplasm. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed a good correlation between MALT1 and BCL10 mRNA expression and underlining genetic changes, with t(14;18)(q32;q21)- and t(1;14)(p22;q32)-positive cases displaying the highest MALT1 and BCL10 mRNA expression respectively. These results show that MALT1 expression pattern is identical to that of BCL10 in normal lymphoid tissues but varies in MALT lymphomas, with high cytoplasmic expression of both MALT1 and BCL10 characterizing those with t(14;18)(q32;q21).	2005	03	02	J Pathol	Ye	Hongtao
15694184	10.1016/j.beha.2004.08.003	Update on MALT lymphomas.	Gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a histologically distinct tumour derived from MALT acquired as a result of Helicobacter pylori infection. Eradication of H. pylori causes clinical regression of the lymphoma in 75% of cases. In seeking to identify those cases resistant to this therapy, and in the interests of further understanding the biology of MALT lymphoma, genetic alterations of MALT lymphomas have been investigated. Three translocations, t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) are specifically associated with MALT lymphoma and the genes involved have been identified. T(11;18) results in a chimeric fusion between the API2 and MALT1 genes and is specifically associated with gastric MALT lymphomas that do not respond to eradication of H. pylori. T(1;14) and t(14;18) deregulate BCL10 and MALT1 expression, respectively. These three chromosomal translocations that involve different genes appear to share common oncogenic properties by targeting the same nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) oncogenic pathway.	2005	07	07	Best Pract Res Clin Haematol	Isaacson	Peter G
15703784	10.1038/sj.leu.2403644	T(3;14)(p14.1;q32) involving IGH and FOXP1 is a novel recurrent chromosomal aberration in MALT lymphoma.	The three chromosomal translocations t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32) are associated with MALT lymphoma. In a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid, we observed t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) by cytogenetic analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed that the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) was rearranged on chromosome 14. Long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on chromosome 3. To determine the frequency of the t(3;14)(p14.1;q32), two fluorescence in situ hybridization assays were established to screen 91 MALT lymphomas, all of which were negative for the above-mentioned three translocations, and eight splenic and six nodal marginal zone lymphomas. Overall, nine MALT lymphomas (10%) harbored t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) comprising tumors of the thyroid (three of six), ocular adnexa (four of 20), and skin (two of 20), whereas those of the stomach (n = 20), salivary gland (n = 20), and lung (n = 5) were negative as well as the splenic and nodal marginal zone lymphomas. Most t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) + MALT lymphomas harbored additional genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. Further studies revealed that the three known translocations and t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) are mutually exclusive. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed upregulation of FOXP1 in cases with t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) or trisomy 3. This study identifies FOXP1 as a new translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT lymphomas.	2005	05	26	Leukemia	Streubel	B
15711920	10.1007/s10495-005-6059-6	Anti-apoptotic action of API2-MALT1 fusion protein involved in t(11;18)(q21;q21) MALT lymphoma.	At least three distinct chromosomal translocations, t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) involving the API2 (also known as c-IAP2)-MALT1 fusion protein, BCL10, and MALT1, respectively, have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Our findings showed that several variants of the API2-MALT1 fusion protein can occur in patients with t(11;18)(q21;q21), and that API2-MALT1 can potently enfance activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas. We also found that MALT1 is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, as is the case with API2, but upon the synthesis of fusion, API2-MALT1 becomes stable against this pathway. This stability of API2-MALT1 may thus result in inappropriate nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma. Recent biochemical and genetic studies have clearly shown that BCL10 and MALT1 form a physical and functional complex and are both required for NF-kappaB activation by antigen receptor stimulation in T and B lymphocytes. It has also been shown that CARMA1, a newly discovered member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) families, is critical for antigen receptor-stimulated NF-kappaB activation. It can be assumed that API2-MALT1 can bypass this normal BCL10/MALT1 cellular signaling pathway linked to NF-kappaB activation, thereby inducing antigen receptor-independent proliferation of lymphocytes. Furthermore, BCL10/MALT1- and API2-MALT1-induced NF-kappaB activation may contribute to anti-apoptotic action probably through NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes. We recently provided direct evidence that API2-MALT1 indeed exerts anti-apoptotic action, in part, through its direct interaction with apoptotic regulators including Smac. Taken together, these findings prompt us to hypothesize that the anti-apoptotic action of API2-MALT1 may be mediated partly by the direct interaction with apoptotic regulators as well as partly by upregulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes. Further studies can be expected to stimulate research into the development of therapeutic drugs that specifically inhibit the antigen receptor signaling-stimulated NF-kappaB activation pathway: such molecule targeting drugs should be useful for interfering with inappropriate proliferation of lymphocytes associated with inflammatory and neoplastic disorders.	2005	06	06	Apoptosis	Hosokawa	Y

15802604	10.1126/science.1107107	PDK1 nucleates T cell receptor-induced signaling complex for NF-kappaB activation.	Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB after engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Recent reports have elucidated a signaling pathway that involves the protein kinase C (PKC), the scaffold protein CARD11 (also called CARMA-1), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein Bcl10, and the paracaspase (protease related to caspases) MALT1 as critical intermediates linking the TCR to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. However, the events proximal to the TCR that initiate the activation of this signaling pathway remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has an essential role in this pathway by regulating the activation of PKC and through signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC and CARD11 to lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC recruits the IKK complex, whereas PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex, thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit known as NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier). Hence, PDK1 plays a critical role by nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway in T cells.	2005	04	12	Science	Lee	Ki-Young
15845895	10.1182/blood-2005-01-0004	Nuclear expression of BCL10 or nuclear factor kappa B helps predict Helicobacter pylori-independent status of low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas with or without t(11;18)(q21;q21).	The t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation is a specific marker for Helicobacter pylori-independent status of low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. However, there are no reliable markers to predict tumor response to H pylori eradication in patients without t(11;18)(q21;q21). Nuclear expression of BCL10 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was recently found to be closely associated with H pylori-independent status of the high-grade counterpart of gastric MALT lymphoma, which usually lacks t(11;18)(q21;q21). This study examined whether these 2 markers can also predict H pylori-independent status of low-grade gastric MALT lymphomas without t(11; 18)(q21;q21). Sixty patients who underwent successful H pylori eradication for low-grade gastric MALT lymphomas were included. Forty-seven (78.3%) patients were negative for t(11;18)(q21;q21); among them, 36 (76.6%) were H pylori dependent and 11 (23.4%) were H pylori independent. Nuclear expression of BCL10 was significantly higher in H pylori-independent than in H pylori-dependent tumors (8 of 11 [72.7%] vs 3 of 36 [8.3%]; P &lt; .001). Nuclear expression of NF-kappaB was also significantly higher in H pylori-independent than in H pylori-dependent tumors (7 of 11 [63.6%] vs 3 of 36 [8.3%]; P &lt; .001). Further, nuclear translocation of BCL10 and NF-kappaB was observed in 12 of the 13 patients with t(11;18)(q21;q21), and all these 12 patients were H pylori independent. In summary, nuclear expression of BCL10 or NF-kappaB is predictive of H pylori-independent status of low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma with or without t(11;18)(q21; q21).	2005	09	21	Blood	Yeh	Kun-Huei
15878976	10.1182/blood-2004-04-1248	Bcl10 can promote survival of antigen-stimulated B lymphocytes.	To understand the nature of negative responses through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), we have screened an expression cDNA library for the ability to block BCR-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in the immature B-cell line, WEHI-231. We isolated multiple copies of full-length, unmutated Bcl10, a signaling adaptor molecule encoded by a gene found to translocate to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus in some mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. A conditionally active form of B-cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) protected WEHI-231 cells from BCR-induced apoptosis upon activation. Induction of Bcl10 activity caused rapid activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. These results support genetic and biochemical experiments that have implicated Bcl10 and its binding partners Carma1 and MALT1 in mediating the ability of the BCR to activate NF-kappaB. The ability of Bcl10 expression to prevent BCR-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells was dependent on NF-kappaB activation. Finally, overexpression of Bcl10 in primary B cells activated ex vivo promoted the survival of these cells after removal of activating stimuli. Taken together these results support the hypothesis that enhanced BCL10 expression caused by translocation to the IGH locus can promote formation of MALT lymphomas.	2005	10	11	Blood	Tian	Maoxin Tim

16123224	10.1182/blood-2004-12-4785	MALT1 contains nuclear export signals and regulates cytoplasmic localization of BCL10.	MALT1, BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma 10), and API2 (apoptosis inhibitor 2)-MALT1 are key molecules in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomagenesis. We previously reported that MALT1 and API2-MALT1 were localized only in cytoplasm, where we suggested that both molecules were likely to be active. In the study presented here, we further examined the localization-determining region by generating various mutants and were able to demonstrate that there were nuclear export signal (NES)-containing domains in the MALT1 C-terminal region. The use of leptomycin B, an NES-specific inhibitor, demonstrated that both MALT1 and API2-MALT1 were predominantly retained in the nuclei, indicating that these molecules were shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner. It was also found that MALT1 was involved in the nuclear export of BCL10, which is originally localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm. These results correlate well with the nuclear BCL10 expression pattern in both t(1;14) and t(11;18) MALT lymphomas. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of MALT1 and BCL10 complex may indicate that these molecules are involved not only in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway but also in other biologic functions in lymphocytes.	2006	01	06	Blood	Nakagawa	Masao
16127295	10.1159/000086789	Accumulation of BCL10 at the perinuclear region is required for the BCL10-mediated nuclear factor-kappa B activation.	The dysregulated overexpression of BCL10 that results from a specific chromosomal translocation t(1;14)(p22;q32) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma has been shown to activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, which may promote growth and survival in tumor cells. Accordingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying NF-kappaB activation may be responsible for lymphomagenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying NF-kappaB activation by BCL10 overexpression. HeLa or COS-1 cells were transfected with BCL10, intracellular localization of BCL10 and the activation of NF-kappaB were analyzed. BCL10 expressed at a high level exhibited a filamentous distribution at the perinuclear region, whereas BCL10 at a low level of expression displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Furthermore, the BCL10-mediated NF-kappaB activation was efficiently inhibited by a Ca2+ chelating agent or a Ca2+ channel blocker. We also found that amino acids (107-119) of BCL10 are required for the formation of filamentous structures at the perinuclear region and NF-kappaB activation. These findings suggest that the filamentous pattern of overexpressed BCL10 at the perinuclear region adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum is important for the BCL10-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	2005	10	14	Pathobiology	Nakamura	Kyoko
16155022	10.1200/JCO.2005.05.011	Molecular pathogenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type occur in a number of anatomic sites, but share overlapping morphologic and immunophenotypic features. Helicobacter pylori infection has been identified as an etiologic factor in gastric MALT lymphoma, and a growing list of other infectious organisms have recently been shown to be associated with MALT lymphomas at other anatomic sites. Although cause and effect has not been established for most of these infectious agents, our understanding of the biology has significantly improved, in part through the application of standard cytogenetic analyses. The common karyotypic alterations that characterize MALT lymphomas include the trisomies 3 and 18, the translocations t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(3;14)(q27;q32), and the recently described t(3;14)(p14.1;q32). This apparent complexity of cytogenetic alterations that have now been implicated in the pathogenesis of extranodal MALT lymphoma serves as a paradigm for molecular cross talk in neoplastic disease. Recent data have shown that at least three of the disparate translocations affect a common signaling mechanism, and thus unify all three under a common pathogenesis, resulting in the constitutive activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway.

Although caspase recruitment domain (CARD) membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein 1 (CARMA1) and CARD9 play important roles in lymphocyte activation, the significance of CARMA1 and CARD9 in the pathogenesis of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma remains to be elucidated. By using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the expression levels of mRNA of CARMA1, CARD9, Bcl10, and the apoptosis inhibitor 2 (API2)-MALT1 chimeric transcript were determined in tissue specimens from 65 patients with primary gastric B-cell lymphoma (43 patients with low-grade MALT lymphoma, 16 patients with MALT lymphoma plus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBL], and 6 patients with DLBL without MALT lymphoma) and in tissue specimens from 18 patients with chronic gastritis. The expression levels of CARMA1 and BCL10 were examined immunohistochemically in 30 patients with lymphoma. CARMA1 mRNA was detected in 55% of lymphoma patients but in only 17% of chronic gastritis patients. The positive rates for CARD9, Bcl10, and API2-MALT1 chimeric transcript in the lymphoma patients were 48%, 98%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the 3 molecules were not detected in any specimens from patients with chronic gastritis. The expression of CARMA1 and CARD9 was frequent in the Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (100% and 86%, respectively), in the API2-MALT1 chimeric transcript-positive patients (100% and 100%, respectively), and in the specimens from patients who did not respond to H. pylori eradication (76% and 71%, respectively). In addition, CARMA1 expression was positive more frequently in patients of DLBL without MALT lymphoma (100%) than in patients of MALT lymphoma (51%). CARMA1 protein expression was correlated significantly with the expression of CARMA1 mRNA and also with the expression of nuclear BCL10. The overexpression of CARMA1 and CARD9 presumably is associated with the development or progression of gastric B-cell lymphoma, especially among patients who have disease in which the pathogenesis is not related to H. pylori.	2005	12	07	Cancer	Nakamura	Shigeo
16310461	10.1016/j.ajo.2005.05.038	BCL10 expression in ocular adnexal lymphomas.	To study BCL10 expression in ocular adnexal lymphoma in the US population and its association with clinical outcomes. Institutional, retrospective study. Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibody against BCL10 on two tissue microarray blocks that were constructed with paraffin-embedded tissues from the same cohort of 48 patients with ocular adnexal lymphomas. The main outcomes that were measured include extraorbital involvement, recurrence rate, and time to recurrence. The median length of the follow-up period was 40 months. Aberrant BCL10 expression (nuclear [moderate intensity] and cytoplasmic [weak to moderate intensity] staining) was observed in 10 of 33 cases (30.3%) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, in 4 of 10 cases (40%) of follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 9 cases; grade 2, 1 case), in 0 of 2 cases of diffused large B-cell lymphoma, in 0 of 1 case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and in 1 of 1 case (100%) of mantle cell lymphoma. There were no differences in clinical parameters at examination (ie, average age, gender, site of occurrence, laterality, extraorbital involvement at diagnosis), recurrence rate, and time to recurrence for patients (MALT lymphoma or follicular lymphoma) with or without aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression. Aberrant BCL10 expression can occur in other types of ocular adnexal lymphomas besides MALT lymphoma. Ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma may have slightly lower frequency of aberrant BCL10 expression than gastric/pulmonary MALT lymphomas that have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, aberrant BCL10 nuclear expression in ocular adnexal lymphoma does not seem to correlate with clinical outcome. Further studies that include a larger number of cases and longer follow-up period are needed to confirm our observation.	2005	12	22	Am J Ophthalmol	Vejabhuti	Choladda
16440771		[Long-term remission after CHOP therapy in a case of multifocal extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with t(1 ; 14) (p22 ; q32) and rearrangement of bcl-10].	The translocation t(1 ; 14)(p22 ; q32) has been reported only in cases of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Moreover, bcl-10 is a novel apoptotic signaling gene located at 1p22 and t(1 ; 14)(p22 ; q32) may directly expose bcl-10 to Ig somatic hypermutation. A recent report indicates a pathogenic role of bcl-10 mutation in the progression of MALT lymphomas. In this report, we describe the first case of multiple extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with t(1 ; 14)(p22 ; q32). A 70-year-old woman was diagnosed as having DLBCL of multiple extranodal sites (lung, duodenum, colon and kidney). Cytogenetic analysis of a renal lesion revealed the chromosome translocations t(1 ; 14)(p22 ; q32) and both IgH and bcl-10 gene rearrangements were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The patient received a regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP). She achieved complete remission after six cycles of chemotherapy and has been free of disease for more than five years. This is the first case of bcl-10 gene rearrangement in DLBCL with t(1 ; 14)(p22 ; q32) and this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of aggressive lymphomas such as MALT lymphomas or in the progression of MALT lymphomas.	2006	03	14	Rinsho Ketsueki	Sakai	Rika
16545185		[Expression of bcl-10 protein in MALT lymphoma].	To investigate the significance of bcl-10 protein expression in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Sixty-two cases of MALT lymphoma were reviewed and immunohistochemical studies for bcl-10 and Ki-67 were performed. Sixty out of the 62 cases studied (96.8%) were positive for bcl-10. Thirty-three (53.2%) showed bcl-10 expression in both the nuclei and cytoplasm, while 27 cases (43.6%) showed only cytoplasmic staining. The 10 cases with Hashimoto's thyroiditis demonstrated bcl-10 expression in the cytoplasm. The mean age of patients with bcl-10 nuclear expression (51.4 years old) was 5.2 years younger than those (56.6 years) without bcl-10 nuclear expression. The former category also showed a male predilection (male to female ratio = 19:14, in contrast to 10:19 in the latter category). The frequency of bcl-10 nuclear expression was lower in cases from thyroid but higher in cases from lung, stomach and intestine (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between bcl-10 nuclear expression and clinical tumor stage (P &gt; 0.05) or tumor cell morphology (P &gt; 0.05). Amongst the 40 cases of gastrointestinal MALT lymphoma, bcl-10 nuclear expression correlated with extent of tumor involvement. The protein was expressed in 36.4% (4 out of 11 cases) of MALT lymphoma confined to mucosa or submucosa, 65.2% (15 out of 23 cases) of those invading down to muscularis propria or subserosa, and 100% (all 6 cases) of those extending beyond serosa (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in Ki-67 proliferative index between bcl-10-positive and bcl-10-negative groups (P &lt; 0.05). Follow-up data were available in 52 patients (83.9%) and the five-year survival rate was no statistically significant difference in survival between bcl-10-positive (29 patients, 96.3%) and bcl-10-negative groups (23 patients, 66.4%, P &gt; 0.05). Two expression patterns of bcl-10 protein were observed in MALT lymphoma: mixed nuclear-cytoplasmic and cytoplasmic only. The bcl-10 nuclear expression appears more important and correlates with anatomic site of tumor and extent of tumor involvement. Immunohistochemical detection of bcl-10 may carry some diagnostic and prognostic implications in assessment of MALT lymphoma.	2007	08	16	Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi	Li	Lei
14574335	10.1038/sj.leu.2403185	Primary pulmonary MALT lymphomas show frequent and heterogeneous cytogenetic abnormalities, including aneuploidy and translocations involving API2 and MALT1 and IGH and MALT1.	API2-MALT1 fusion and aneuploidy are common chromosomal abnormalities in MALT lymphoma. In studying their incidence and relationship in primary pulmonary MALT lymphomas, a translocation involving MALT1 and IGH was also identified. In all, 28 primary pulmonary MALT lymphomas were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization using an API2-MALT1 probe and multiple centromeric probes, as well as IGH-BCL2, IGH-MALT1, and MALT1 breakapart probes in selected cases. Seven (25%) had API2-MALT1 fusion; all seven lacked aneuploidy except for two with trisomy 3 in a small clone. Three (11%) had IGH-MALT1 fusion; two also showed trisomy 3 and 12. A total of 11 (39%) had aneuploidy only, with trisomy 3 and 18 being the most common. Ectopic nuclear bcl-10 expression, which has been previously associated with API2-MALT1, was seen by immunohistochemistry in 86% of API2-MALT1 fusion-positive cases, one IGH-MALT1 fusion-positive case, two aneuploidy-only cases, and two normal cases. In primary pulmonary MALT lymphomas, cytogenetic abnormalities are common (75%) and heterogeneous, encompassing API2-MALT1 and IGH-MALT1, which are mutually exclusive, as well as aneuploidy, which may be present in the latter but is rare in the former. Ectopic nuclear bcl-10 expression is associated with API2-MALT1 but may also be seen in IGH-MALT1 fusion-positive, aneuploidy-only, and normal cases.	2004	02	10	Leukemia	Remstein	E D
14638696	10.1074/jbc.C300460200	Rip2 participates in Bcl10 signaling and T-cell receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	Engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately results in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which regulates many T-cell functions including proliferation, differentiation and cytokine production. Herein we demonstrate that Rip2, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing serine/threonine kinase, plays an important role in this cascade and is required for optimal TCR signaling and NF-kappaB activation. Following TCR engagement, Rip2 associated with Bcl10, a CARD-containing signaling component of the TCR-induced NF-kappaB pathway, and induced its phosphorylation. Rip2-deficient mice were defective in TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation, interleukin-2 production, and proliferation in vitro and exhibited defective T-cell-dependent responses in vivo. The defect in Rip2-/- T-cells correlated with a lack of TCR-induced Bcl10 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deficiency in Bcl10-dependent NF-kappaB activation could be rescued in Rip2-/- embryonic fibroblasts by exogenous wild-type Rip2 but not a kinase-dead mutant. Together these data define an important role for Rip2 in TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation and T-cell function and highlight the significance of post-translational modification of Bcl10 by Rip2 in T-cell signaling.	2004	02	10	J Biol Chem	Ruefli-Brasse	Astrid A
14657271	10.1242/jcs.00904	NF-kappaB signaling in lymphocytes: a new cast of characters.	Cell-surface antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes are complex, multisubunit assemblies that must recruit several accessory proteins and activate multiple signaling pathways in order to illicit a proper immune response. One pathway culminates in the activation of specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, which is necessary for the ultimate activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Since NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response (e.g. in lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production), it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms by which NF-kappaB is regulated. Nevertheless, the connection between PKC activation and NF-kappaB has remained a mystery that has now been at least partly solved. Recent findings implicate a new scaffolding protein, Bimp3/CARMA1/CARD11, as a key factor in bridging PKC activation with the downstream activation of Bcl10 and MALT1, which ultimately stimulates NF-kappaB. Since some of these signaling components are lymphocyte specific, therapeutic agents that block this pathway could blunt the inappropriate proliferation of lymphocytes associated with certain inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Alternatively, agents that specifically augment this pathway, thereby enhancing immune function in immunodeficiency, may be developed.	2004	07	09	J Cell Sci	Lucas	Peter C
14673152	10.1128/MCB.24.1.164-171.2003	CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation is mediated by recruitment of protein kinase C-theta, Bcl10, and IkappaB kinase beta to the immunological synapse through CARMA1.	CARMA1 (also known as CARD11) is a scaffold molecule and contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and a membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) domain. It plays an essential role in mediating CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which CARMA1 mediates costimulatory signals remains to be determined. Here, we show that CARMA1 is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. This membrane association is essential for the function of CARMA1, since a mutant of CARMA1, CARMA1(L808P), that is defective in the membrane association cannot rescue CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation in JPM50.6 CARMA1-deficient T cells. Although CD3/CD28 costimulation effectively induces the formation of the immunological synapse in CARMA1-deficient T cells, the recruitment of protein kinase C-theta (PKC-theta), Bcl10, and IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) into lipid rafts of the immunological synapse is defective. Moreover, expression of wild-type CARMA1, but not CARMA1(L808P), restores the recruitment of PKC-theta, Bcl10, and IKKbeta into lipid rafts in CARMA1-deficient T cells. Consistently, expression of a mutant CARMA1, CARMA1(DeltaCD), that cannot associate with Bcl10 failed to restore CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation in JPM50.6 cells, whereas expression of Bcl10-CARMA(DeltaCD) fusion protein effectively restored this NF-kappaB activation. Together, these results indicate that CARMA1 mediates CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation by recruiting downstream signaling components into the immunological synapse.	2004	01	21	Mol Cell Biol	Wang	Donghai
14674990	10.1111/j.1440-1827.2004.01580.x	No evidence of a correlation between BCL10 expression and API2-MALT1 gene rearrangement in ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma.	In the present study, 62 cases of ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative disorders were reviewed clinicopathologically. Of them, 51 were extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma), five were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, one was NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type, and four were reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. These lymphoma cases showed a favorable clinical course and localized disease, except for the case of NK/T cell lymphoma, although 19 cases (32.8%) had a recurrence of disease. To clarify the correlation between BCL10 protein expression and API2-MALT1 gene rearrangement, the 51 cases of MALT lymphoma and 5 cases of DLBCL were analyzed by immunohistochemical and RT-PCR methods. Nuclear BCL10 expression was identified in 58% of MALT lymphoma cases, but not in any DLBCL cases. There was no evidence of a correlation between aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression and the clinical parameters examined in the present study. API2-MALT1 transcription was not demonstrated in either the MALT lymphoma cases or the DLBCL cases studied using a multiplex one-tube reverse transcriptase-PCR method. These findings indicate that the nuclear expression of BCL10 is unlikely to correlate with the API2-MALT1 fusion gene in ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma.	2008	04	03	Pathol Int	Adachi	Akiko
14695475	10.1038/nature02273	Bcl10 activates the NF-kappaB pathway through ubiquitination of NEMO.	The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is activated in response to many stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, environmental stresses and, in the case of B and T lymphocytes, by antigenic stimulation. Bcl10 is essential for NF-kappaB activation by T- and B-cell receptors. T and B lymphocytes from Bcl10-deficient mice fail to activate NF-kappaB in response to antigen-receptor stimulation and, as a consequence, are unable to proliferate. Bcl10 overexpression is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB, a process that requires the NF-kappaB essential modulator NEMO (also known as IKK-gamma), which is the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB kinase complex. However, the cellular mechanism by which Bcl10 activates the NF-kappaB pathway remains unclear. Here we show that Bcl10 targets NEMO for lysine-63-linked ubiquitination. Notably, a mutant form of NEMO that cannot be ubiquitinated inhibited Bcl10-induced NF-kappaB activation. Paracaspase and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC13) were both required for Bcl10-induced NEMO ubiquitination and subsequent NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, short interfering RNAs that reduced the expression of paracaspase and UBC13 abrogated the effects of Bcl10. Thus, the adaptor protein Bcl10 promotes activation of NF-kappaB transcription factors through paracaspase- and UBC13-dependent ubiquitination of NEMO.	2004	01	16	Nature	Zhou	Honglin
14724296	10.1073/pnas.0307858100	Complex and dynamic redistribution of NF-kappaB signaling intermediates in response to T cell receptor stimulation.	The central zone of the supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) is a zone of T cell receptor (TCR) enrichment that forms at a T cell/antigen-presenting cell (APC) junction in response to antigen stimulation. We demonstrate that there is a surprisingly complex relocalization process that brings PKC and Bcl10, two intermediates in TCR activation of NF-kappaB, to the cytoplasmic face of the c-SMAC. TCR activation causes enrichment of PKC at the c-SMAC, followed by Bcl10 relocalization to punctate cytoplasmic structures, often at sites distant from the c-SMAC. These Bcl10 structures then undergo further relocalization, becoming enriched at the c-SMAC. TCR activation of NF-kappaB therefore involves the dynamic relocalization of multiple signaling intermediates, with distinct phases proximal to and distant from the c-SMAC.	2004	03	30	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Schaefer	Brian C
14754896	10.1074/jbc.M310599200	MALT1/paracaspase is a signaling component downstream of CARMA1 and mediates T cell receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation.	T cell receptor (TCR) induces a series of signaling cascades and leads to activation of multiple transcription factors, including NF-kappaB. Although the mechanism of TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation is not fully understood, recent studies indicate that Bcl10 and CARMA1, two adaptor/scaffold proteins, play essential roles in mediating TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. MALT1/paracaspase is a caspase-like protein that contains an N-terminal death domain, two Ig-like domains, and a C-terminal caspase-like domain. It binds to Bcl10 through its Ig-like domains and cooperates with Bcl10 to activate NF-kappaB. Recently, it has been shown that MALT1 is involved in mediating TCR signal transduction, leading to activation of NF-kappaB. In this study, we show that MALT1 is recruited into the lipid rafts of the immunological synapse following activation of the TCR and the CD28 coreceptor (CD3/CD28 costimulation). This recruitment of MALT1 is dependent on CARMA1 because CD3/CD28 costimulation failed to recruit MALT1 into lipid rafts in CARMA1-deficient T cells. In addition, we also found that MALT1 not only binds to Bcl10 directly, but also associates with CARMA1 in a Bcl10-independent manner. Therefore, MALT1, Bcl10, and CARMA1 form a trimolecular complex. Expression of a MALT1 deletion mutant containing only the N-terminal death domain and the two Ig-like domains completely blocked CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced, but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced, NF-kappaB activation. Together, these results indicate that MALT1 is a crucial signaling component in the TCR signaling pathway.	2004	07	22	J Biol Chem	Che	Tuanjie
14989765		[Expression of t(11;18) and bcl-10 in gastrointestinal MALT lymphoma].	To detect chromosome translocation t(11;18) (q21;q21) and the nuclear expression of bcl-10 in gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in Chinese, a possible API2-MALT fusion transcript specific to t(11; 18) (q21; q21) in tumors from 42 cases of primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (29 cases of low grade MALT lymphoma, 13 cases of transformed MALT lymphoma) and 40 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma was examined by means of RT-PCR and proved by DNA-sequencing. Bcl-10 expression was examined by immunohistochemical method. The results showed that t(11;18) (q21;q21) was 14% positive in cases of low grade MALT lymphomas and 46% positive in transformed MALT lymphomas, but none in cases of DLBCL. Bcl-10 nuclear expression was seen 61% in low grade MALT and 69% in transformed MALT lymphoma. It was suggested that t(11;18) (q21;q21) was related to the prognosis and development of highly advanced MALT lymphoma but not relevant to DLBCL. Bcl-10 nuclear expressions were not significantly different between these two groups, which remains to be explained.	2004	06	15	Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Dong	Fei

15070758	10.1073/pnas.0400885101	Differential dependence of CD4+CD25+ regulatory and natural killer-like T cells on signals leading to NF-kappaB activation.	Natural killer-like (NK) T, regulatory T (TR), and memory type T cells display surface phenotypes reminiscent of activated T cells. Previously, we reported that the generation of TR cells and, to a lesser extent, of memory type T cells, depends on IkappaB kinase 2. Here, we show that T cell-specific ablation of IkappaB kinase 2, in addition, completely precludes NKT cell development. T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-induced signals to activate NF-kappaB are essential for mature T cell activation, leading us to hypothesize that this pathway could play an important role in the generation of the antigen-driven T cell subsets comprising TR, memory type T, and NKT cells. TCR-mediated NF-kappaB activation critically depends on Bcl10 and PKCtheta. By using mice deficient for these proteins, we demonstrate that the generation of TR and, to a lesser extent, of memory type T cells, depends on Bcl10 and PKCtheta, and therefore, most likely on NF-kappaB activation initiated by TCR engagement. NKT cells, on the other hand, require PKCtheta for thymic development, whereas absence of Bcl10 leads primarily to the reduction of peripheral NKT cell numbers.	2004	07	19	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Schmidt-Supprian	Marc
15082780	10.1128/MCB.24.9.3860-3873.2004	Degradation of Bcl10 induced by T-cell activation negatively regulates NF-kappa B signaling.	Bcl10 is a critical regulator of NF-kappa B activity in T and B cells, coupling antigen receptor signaling to NF-kappa B activation via protein kinase C (PKC). Here we show that PKC or T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 signaling results in downregulation of Bcl10 protein levels, thereby attenuating NF-kappa B transcriptional activity. Bcl10 degradation requires an intact caspase recruitment domain and is not observed after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha or lipopolysaccharides. Bcl10 downregulation is not affected by proteasome inhibitors but is accompanied by transient localization to lysosomal vesicles, suggesting involvement of the lysosomal pathway rather than the proteasome. The HECT domain ubiquitin ligases NEDD4 and Itch promote ubiquitination and degradation of Bcl10, thus downmodulating NF-kappa B activation. Since CD3/CD28-induced activation of JNK is not affected by the decline of Bcl10, degradation of Bcl10 selectively terminates IKK/NF-kappa B signaling in response to TCR stimulation. Together, these results suggest a new mechanism of negative signaling in which TCR/PKC signaling initially activates Bcl10 but later promotes its degradation.	2004	06	10	Mol Cell Biol	Scharschmidt	Erika

15125833	10.1016/s1097-2765(04)00236-9	The TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAK1 kinase mediate IKK activation by BCL10 and MALT1 in T lymphocytes.	The CARD domain protein BCL10 and paracaspase MALT1 are essential for the activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Here we present evidence that TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAK1 protein kinase mediate IKK activation by BCL10 and MALT1. RNAi-mediated silencing of MALT1, TAK1, TRAF6, and TRAF2 suppressed TCR-dependent IKK activation and interleukin-2 production in T cells. Furthermore, we have reconstituted the pathway from BCL10 to IKK activation in vitro with purified proteins of MALT1, TRAF6, TAK1, and ubiquitination enzymes including Ubc13/Uev1A. We find that a small fraction of BCL10 and MALT1 proteins form high molecular weight oligomers. Strikingly, only these oligomeric forms of BCL10 and MALT1 can activate IKK in vitro. The MALT1 oligomers bind to TRAF6, induce TRAF6 oligomerization, and activate the ligase activity of TRAF6 to polyubiquitinate NEMO. These results reveal an oligomerization --&gt; ubiquitination --&gt; phosphorylation cascade that culminates in NF-kappaB activation in T lymphocytes.	2004	06	23	Mol Cell	Sun	Lijun
15143341	10.1038/modpathol.3800164	t(1;14) and t(11;18) in the differential diagnosis of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is caused by several B-cell proliferative disorders including lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is particularly difficult as there is a considerable overlap in histological presentation. We report a case of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia with involvement of the peripheral blood, bone marrow and stomach. Serum chemistry revealed an IgM of 5.4 g/dl, but Bence-Jones protein in urine was negative. Abnormal lymphoid cells were detected in both blood and the bone marrow. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate showed that majority of cells were CD20(+), CD38(+), expressing immunoglobulin lambda light chain, but CD5(-) and CD10(-). Gastric biopsies revealed infiltration of the gastric mucosa by small lymphoid cells showing plasmacytoid differentiation and occasional Dutcher bodies. Lymphoepithelial lesions and Helicobacter pylori were not seen. Thus, the differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma was raised. To resolve this, we performed BCL10 immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the API2-MALT1 fusion transcript of t(11;18)(q21;q21). Both bone marrow and gastric biopsies showed strong BCL10 nuclear staining, similar to that seen in t(1;14)(p22;q32) positive mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, but absence of the API2-MALT1 fusion transcript. To further ascertain whether the detection of t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(11;18)(q21;q21) can be reliably used for the differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, we screened for these translocations by BCL10 immunohistochemistry in 58 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and RT-PCR for t(11;18)(q21;q21) in 40 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, respectively. None of the lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas studied harbored these translocations. Thus, detection of t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(11;18)(q21;q21) is useful in the differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	2005	01	13	Mod Pathol	Ye	Hongtao
15184390	10.1074/jbc.M402244200	Physical and functional interaction of CARMA1 and CARMA3 with Ikappa kinase gamma-NFkappaB essential modulator.	CARMA proteins are scaffold molecules that contain a caspase recruitment domain and a membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like domain. CARMA1 plays a critical role in mediating activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor following antigen receptor stimulation of both B and T lymphocytes. However, the biochemical mechanism by which CARMA1 regulates activation of NFkappaB remains to be determined. Here we have shown that CARMA1 and CARMA3 physically associate with Ikappa kinase gamma/NFkappaB essential modulator (IkappaKgamma-NEMO) in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. CARMA1 participates to an inducible large molecular complex that contains IkappaKgamma/NEMO, Bcl10, and IkappaKalpha/beta kinases. Expression of the NEMO-binding region of CARMA3 exerts a dominant negative effect on Bcl10-mediated activation of NFkappaB. Thus, our results provide direct evidence for physical and functional interaction between CARMA and the IkappaK complex and offer a biochemical framework to understand the molecular activities controlled by CARMA-1, -2, and -3 and Bcl10.	2004	09	24	J Biol Chem	Stilo	Romania
15207693	10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.112	Characterization of Bcl10 as a potential transcriptional activator that interacts with general transcription factor TFIIB.	The importance of aberrant Bcl10 nuclear expression implicated in lymphomagenesis is becoming increasingly apparent. Our previous works indicate that Bcl10 can transactivate gene expression in yeast, nevertheless, little is known about the activities of nuclear Bcl10 in the mammalian cells and the mechanisms by which it modulates transcription. To understand it better, we mapped the location of the activation domain of Bcl10. This was done in the context of its interaction with TFIIB, as well as its ability to activate transcription as a fusion protein linked to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 in the mammalian cells. Both approaches demonstrated that Bcl10 contains an activation domain in its N-terminal 13 amino acids. Together, these findings suggest that Bcl10 nuclear expression may modulate gene expression and Bcl10 is a potential transcriptional activator apart from its traditional roles that have been found.	2004	08	13	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Liu	Yingle
15210867	10.112/4.3.3	Ubiquitination for activation: new directions in the NF-kappaB roadmap.	Signal transduction through the T cell receptor (TCR) and a costimulatory molecule, CD28, results in the stimulation of multiple signaling pathways, leading to the activation of several transcription factors including activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The molecular mechanisms by which NF-kappaB is activated by TCR-CD28 have only recently become known. New findings indicate that the adaptor molecules CARMA1 and Bcl10 are essential to the process. Additionally, a critical role for MALT1/paracaspase has been identified. MALT1, CARMA1, and Bcl10 form a tripartite protein complex, in which Bcl10 is thought to facilitate the oligomerization of MALT1 monomers. Overexpression of MALT1, as observed in a subset of lymphoma patients, leads to the potent activation of NF-kappaB, suggesting that MALT1 might stimulate (directly or indirectly) the kinase complex [IKK, inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase] responsible for activating cytoplasmic NF-kappaB for translocation into the nucleus. Moreover, the MALT1-CARMA1-Bcl10 complex is responsible for ubiquitination of NEMO, a step that appears to be critical for TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation but not for induction mediated by other stimuli such as TNF or IL-1.	2008	03	24	Mol Interv	Lynch	Oonagh T
15213237	10.1074/jbc.M400241200	BCL10 mediates lipopolysaccharide/toll-like receptor-4 signaling through interaction with Pellino2.	Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways signal through microbial components stimulation to induce innate immune responses. Herein, we demonstrate that BCL10, a critical molecule that signals between the T cell receptor and IkappaB kinase complexes, is involved in the innate immune system and is required for appropriate TLR4 pathway and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, BCL10 was recruited to TLR4 signaling complexes and associated with Pellino2, an essential component down-stream of BCL10 in the TLR4 pathway. In a BCL10-deficient macrophage cell line, LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was consistently defective, whereas activator protein-1 and Elk-1 signaling was intact. In addition, we found that BCL10 was targeted by SOCS3 for negative regulation in LPS signaling. The recruitment of BCL10 to TLR4 signaling complexes was attenuated by induced expression of SOCS3 in a feedback loop. Furthermore, ectopic SOCS3 expression blocked the interaction between BCL10 and Pellino2 together with BCL10-generated NF-kappaB activation and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression. Together, these data define an important role of BCL10 in the innate immune system.	2004	12	10	J Biol Chem	Liu	Yingle
15337797	10.1200/JCO.2004.10.087	Nuclear expression of BCL10 or nuclear factor kappa B predicts Helicobacter pylori-independent status of early-stage, high-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas.	A high percentage of early-stage, high-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas remain Helicobacter pylori dependent. t(11;18)(q21;q21), a genetic aberration highly predictive of H. pylori-independent status in low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma, is rarely detected in its high-grade counterpart. This study examined whether nuclear expression of BCL10 or nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is useful in predicting H. pylori-independent status in patients with stage IE high-grade gastric MALT lymphomas. Twenty-two patients who had participated in a prospective study of H. pylori eradication for stage IE high-grade gastric MALT lymphomas were studied. The expression of BCL10 and NF-kappaB in pretreatment paraffin-embedded lymphoma tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The presence of t(11;18)(q21;q21) was identified by a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the API2-MALT1 chimeric transcript. Aberrant nuclear expression of BCL10 was detected in seven (87.5%) of eight H. pylori-independent and in none of 14 H. pylori-dependent high-grade gastric MALT lymphomas (P &lt;.001). All seven patients with nuclear BCL10 expression had nuclear expression of NF-kappaB, compared with only two of 15 patients without nuclear BCL10 expression (P =.002). As a single variable, the frequency of nuclear expression of NF-kappaB was also significantly higher in H. pylori-independent tumors than in H. pylori-dependent tumors (seven of eight [87.5%] v two of 15 [12.3%]; P =.002). The API2-MALT1 fusion transcript was detected in only one (12.5%) of eight H. pylori-independent lymphomas. Nuclear expression of BCL10 or NF-kappaB is highly predictive of H. pylori-independent status in high-grade gastric MALT lymphoma, and coexpression of these two markers in the nuclei is frequent.	2004	09	17	J Clin Oncol	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
15539155	10.1016/j.immuni.2004.09.012	SAP regulates T(H)2 differentiation and PKC-theta-mediated activation of NF-kappaB1.	XLP is caused by mutations affecting SAP, an adaptor that recruits Fyn to SLAM family receptors. SAP-deficient mice recapitulate features of XLP, including increased T cell activation and decreased humoral responses post-infection. SAP-deficient T cells also show increased TCR-induced IFN-gamma and decreased T(H)2 cytokine production. We demonstrate that the defect in IL-4 secretion in SAP-deficient T cells is independent of increased IFN-gamma production. SAP-deficient cells respond normally to polarizing cytokines, yet show impaired TCR-mediated induction of GATA-3 and IL-4. Examination of TCR signaling revealed normal Ca(2+) mobilization and ERK activation in SAP-deficient cells, but decreased PKC-theta recruitment, Bcl-10 phosphorylation, IkappaB-alpha degradation, and nuclear NF-kappaB1/p50 levels. Similar defects were observed in Fyn-deficient cells. SLAM engagement amplified PKC-theta recruitment in wt but not SAP- or Fyn-deficient cells, arguing that a SAP/Fyn-mediated pathway enhances PKC-theta/NF-kappaB1 activation and suggesting a role for this pathway in T(H)2 regulation.	2004	12	15	Immunity	Cannons	Jennifer L
15540895	10.1532/ijh97.04101	Nuclear factor kappaB activation and antiapoptosis in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	Three distinct chromosomal translocations, t(11;18), t(1;14), and t(14;18), involving the API2-MALT1 fusion protein, BCL10, and MALT1 have been convincingly implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that BCL10 and MALT1 form a physical and functional complex and are both essential for nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation by antigen receptor stimulation in lymphocytes. API2-MALT1 can bypass the BCL10/MALT1 pathway linking to NF-kappaB activation, thereby inducing antigen receptor-independent events of lymphocytes. BCL10/MALT1- and API2-MALT1-induced NF-kappaB activation can be assumed to be able to contribute to antiapoptosis, probably through NF-kappaB-mediated up-regulation of several apoptotic inhibitor genes. We also have provided direct evidence that API2-MALT1 can exert an antiapoptotic effect, in part through its direct interaction with apoptotic regulators. We therefore hypothesize that the antiapoptotic effect of API2-MALT1 may be mediated by the interaction with apoptotic regulators as well as by the up-regulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes. Finally, we hope that further studies will stimulate research leading to the development of therapeutic drugs that specifically inhibit the antigen receptor-stimulated NF-kappaB activation pathway. Such drugs should be useful for interfering with inappropriate proliferation of lymphocytes associated with inflammatory and neoplastic disorders, including MALT lymphomas.	2005	02	16	Int J Hematol	Hosokawa	Yoshitaka
15541657	10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.022	The roles of CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 in antigen receptor signaling.	Lymphocyte activation plays a critical role in immune responses. Dysregulation of lymphocyte activation can cause autoimmune, immunodeficient diseases, or leukemia/lymphoma. Lymphocyte activation is triggered by stimulation of antigen receptors, T cell receptors (TCR) or B cell receptors (BCR), on the surfaces of T or B lymphocyte, respectively. Stimulation of TCR or BCR induces a series of signal transduction cascades leading to activation of multiple transcription factors including NF-kappaB. Recent studies demonstrate that CARMA1, a scaffold protein, plays an essential role in mediating TCR- or BCR-induced NF-kappaB activation by recruiting two adaptor proteins, Bcl10 and MALT1, to lipid rafts following stimulation of antigen receptors. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism by which proximal signaling components connect antigen receptor signaling to CARMA1, and how CARMA1 regulates Bcl10 and MALT1, leading to activation of NF-kappaB. In addition, the roles of CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 in lymphocyte activation and development will also be discussed.	2005	04	28	Semin Immunol	Lin	Xin
15577674	10.1097/00000478-200412000-00003	Gastric MALT lymphomas are divided into three groups based on responsiveness to Helicobacter Pylori eradication and detection of API2-MALT1 fusion.	Gastric MALT lymphoma shows unique features including regression by Helicobacter pylori eradication and API2-MALT1 fusion. We performed a molecular and clinicopathologic study for 115 cases. All eradication-responsive cases were devoid of API2-MALT1 fusion. All tumors positive for the fusion and all negative for H. pylori infection were nonresponsive to the eradication. Consequently, gastric MALT lymphomas were divided into three groups: Eradication-responsive and fusion-negative (group A, n = 72), eradication-nonresponsive and fusion-negative (group B, n = 22), and eradication-nonresponsive and fusion-positive (group C, n = 21). Group A tumors were characterized by low clinical stage and superficial gastric wall involvement, and group C tumors by low H. pylori infection rate, advanced clinical stage, and nuclear BCL10 expression. All group C tumors showed exclusively low-grade histology. Group B tumors, which have not been well recognized, frequently showed nodal involvement, deep gastric wall involvement, and advanced clinical stage, and sometimes an increased large cell component. A multivariate discriminant analysis revealed that responsiveness to the eradication could be predicted accurately by negative API2-MALT1 fusion, positive H. pylori infection, low clinical stage, and superficial gastric wall invasion, the former being the most important factor for the prediction. This 3-group categorization may be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of gastric MALT lymphoma.	2005	01	13	Am J Surg Pathol	Inagaki	Hiroshi
15634591		[Expression of BCL-10 in gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma].	To explore the significance of BCL-10 protein expression in the gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed using CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD45RO, CD23, CD5, CD10 monoclonal antibodies in 43 cases of gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas, including 25 indolent classical MALT lymphomas and 18 MALT lymphomas with large cell transformation. BCL-10 protein expression was assayed in the tumor cells. In 25 low-grade MALT lymphomas, expression of BCL-10 was found in the nuclei in 10 cases, in both nuclei and cytoplasm 1 case, in cytoplasm 3 cases and no expression 11 cases. In 18 transformed MALT lymphomas, BCL-10 was expressed in the nuclei in 7 cases, in both nuclei and cytoplasm 1 case, in cytoplasm 2 cases, no expression 8 cases. The frequency of BCL-10 expression in nuclei was the highest (44.2%). The frequency of BCL-10 expression in nuclei in the gastrointestinal MALT lymphoma is high, indicating that it may associate with the pathogenesis of this entity, and may be helpful to its diagnosis.	2008	12	22	Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Wang	Miao
15637807	10.1016/j.febslet.2004.10.094	Inhibition of Bcl10-mediated activation of NF-kappa B by BinCARD, a Bcl10-interacting CARD protein.	We have identified a novel CARD-containing protein from EST database. BinCARD (Bcl10-interacting protein with CARD). BinCARD was ubiquitously expressed. Co-immunoprecipitation, In vitro binding, mammalian two-hybrid, and immunostaining assays revealed that BinCARD interacted with Bcl10 through CARD. BinCARD potently suppressed NF-kappa B activation induced by Bcl10 and decreased the amounts of phosphorylated Bcl10. Mutations at the residue Leu17 or Leu65, which is highly conserved in CARD, abolished the inhibitory effects of BinCARD on both Bcl10-induced activation of NF-kappa B and phosphorylation of Bcl10. Further, expression of BinCARD inhibited Bcl10 phosphorylation induced by T cell activation signal. These results suggest that BinCARD interacts with Bcl10 to inhibit Bcl10-mediated activation of NF-kappa B and to suppress Bcl10 phosphorylation.	2005	01	28	FEBS Lett	Woo	Ha-Na
12393483	10.1182/blood-2002-07-2009	Cell cycle deregulation in B-cell lymphomas.	Disruption of the physiologic balance between cell proliferation and death is a universal feature of all cancers. In general terms, human B-cell lymphomas can be subdivided into 2 main groups, low- and high-growth fraction lymphomas, according to the mechanisms through which this imbalance is achieved. Most types of low-growth fraction lymphomas are initiated by molecular events resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis, such as translocations affecting BCL2, in follicular lymphoma, or BCL10 and API2/MLT1, in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. This results in cell accumulation as a consequence of prolonged cell survival. In contrast, high-growth fraction lymphomas are characterized by an enhanced proliferative activity, as a result of the deregulation of oncogenes with cell cycle regulatory functions, such as BCL6, in large B-cell lymphoma, or c-myc, in Burkitt lymphoma. Low- and high-growth fraction lymphomas are both able to accumulate other alterations in cell cycle regulation, most frequently involving tumor suppressor genes such as p16(INK4a), p53, and p27(KIP1). As a consequence, these tumors behave as highly aggressive lymphomas. The simultaneous inactivation of several of these regulators confers increased aggressivity and proliferative advantage to tumoral cells. In this review we discuss our current knowledge of the alterations in each of these pathways, with special emphasis on the deregulation of cell cycle progression, in an attempt to integrate the available information within a global model that describes the contribution of these molecular changes to the genesis and progression of B-cell lymphomas.	2003	03	13	Blood	Sánchez-Beato	Margarita
12517817	10.1182/blood-2002-10-3167	High incidence of t(11;18)(q21;q21) in Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma.	In approximately 5% to 10% of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection is absent, and their pathogenesis is poorly understood. We reviewed the clinical data and histology, and we examined t(11;18)(q21;q21) and BCL10 expression pattern in 17 such cases. In each case, the absence of H pylori was confirmed by negative serology and histology/immunohistochemistry. Five cases with stage I(E) disease were first treated with antibiotics, and none of them showed any endoscopic or histologic response. Review of the histology failed to identify any apparent difference between gastric MALT lymphomas with and without H pylori infection. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed t(11;18)(q21;q21) in 9 (53%) of 17 cases, more frequent in lymphomas at stage II(E) or above (5 of 6) than those at stage I(E) (3 of 10). Two t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive lymphomas were treated by partial gastrectomy and more than 16 years later showed lymphoma relapse in the gastric stump with dissemination to other mucosal sites, poorly responsive to therapy. BCL10 nuclear expression was observed in 7 of 8 t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive cases and 4 of 7 t(11;18)(q21;q21)-negative cases, including one case suspicious for a BCL10-involved chromosomal translocation. Our results show that t(11;18)(q21;q21) occurs at a high frequency in H pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphomas. Translocation-positive gastric MALT lymphomas tend to be aggressive, and patients with such lymphomas might benefit from prompt treatment and close follow-up.	2003	05	21	Blood	Ye	Hongtao

NF-kappaB is an important mediator of genotoxic stress and regulates the expression of genes required for both cell proliferation and cell death. Bcl10 is phosphorylated in vivo, however, the protein kinase or kinases responsible are not known. Here, we show that Bcl10 is phosphorylated in response to UV irradiation. UV-induced phosphorylation of Bcl10 was inhibited by the p38 stress-activated protein kinase inhibitors SB203580 and PD169316, suggesting that p38 is required for UV-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl10.	2003	04	09	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Bodero	Amanda J
12651604	10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63908-9	API2-MALT1 fusion defines a distinctive clinicopathologic subtype in pulmonary extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.	t(11;18)(q21;q21) is associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma and results in API2-MALT1 fusion. However, its clinicopathologic significance remains unclarified. API2-MALT1 fusion is detected most frequently in MALT lymphomas primarily involving the lung. We therefore screened 51 cases of pulmonary MALT lymphoma for API2-MALT1 fusion, and studied its relationship with clinicopathologic factors including the immunohistochemical expression of BCL10, another MALT lymphoma-associated molecule. The API2-MALT1 fusion transcript was detected in 21 of 51 (41%) cases, and was correlated with the absence of any underlying autoimmune disease, and with a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase, a ""typical"" histology without marked plasmacytic differentiation or an increased number of large cells, and aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression. However, its prognostic impact was not identified in the limited follow-up (6 to 187 months, median 27). These data suggest that the API2-MALT1 fusion may be a causative gene abnormality unrelated to autoimmune disease. In addition, this alteration may define a homogeneous MALT lymphoma subtype that is clinically more indolent and histologically more ""typical."" Aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression may have a possible role as a tool to screen for this API2-MALT1 fusion. A large-scale study with a long follow-up is necessary to establish the prognostic significance of API2-MALT1 fusion.	2003	06	12	Am J Pathol	Okabe	Mitsukuni
12676782	10.1182/blood-2002-11-3502	Variable frequencies of t(11;18)(q21;q21) in MALT lymphomas of different sites: significant association with CagA strains of H pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma.	t(11;18)(q21;q21) is a specific chromosomal translocation associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. It fuses the amino terminal of the API2 gene to the carboxyl terminal of the MALT1 gene and generates a chimeric fusion product. Although the translocation is frequently detected in gastric and pulmonary MALT lymphoma, its incidence in MALT lymphomas from other sites is largely unknown. It also remains unknown whether the occurrence of the translocation is influenced by the nature of preceding diseases associated with MALT lymphomas. We screened for t(11; 18)(q21;q21) in 417 cases of MALT lymphoma from 8 major sites by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. t(11;18)(q21;q21) was found at highest frequencies in MALT lymphomas from the lung (38%) and stomach (24%), and at moderate frequencies in those from the conjunctiva (19%) and orbit (14%). However, the translocation was found only rarely in MALT lymphomas from the salivary gland (1%) and was absent in those from the thyroid, skin, liver, and other rare sites, and in immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID). In gastric MALT lymphoma, t(11;18)(q21;q21) was significantly associated with infection by CagA-positive strains of Helicobacter pylori. As CagA-positive strains of H pylori are much more potent in induction of host inflammatory responses, including activation of neutrophils, which release highly genotoxic oxygen reactive species, we therefore examined neutrophil infiltration in recognized precursors of MALT lymphoma including H pylori-associated gastritis, lymphoepithelial sialadenitis, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Neutrophil infiltration was prominent in H pylori-associated gastritis but not in lymphoepithelial sialadenitis and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Our results demonstrate that t(11;18)(q21; q21) occurs at markedly variable frequencies in MALT lymphoma of different sites and suggest that the occurrence of the translocation is influenced by the nature of premalignant diseases associated with MALT lymphoma. Oxidative damage might play a role in development of t(11;18)(q21; q21).	2003	09	22	Blood	Ye	Hongtao
12692046	10.1136/gut.52.5.641	Distinct methylated profiles in Helicobacter pylori dependent and independent gastric MALT lymphomas.	Gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are clinically subdivided into Helicobacter pylori dependent and independent, according to H. pylori infection and the therapeutic course. In previous reports it has been suggested that H. pylori independent cases develop from H. pylori dependent cases, and sometimes transform into high grade diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). To better understand the pathogenesis of H. pylori dependent and independent MALT lymphomas, we analysed the methylation profiles of eight independent CpG islands, including p15, p16, p73, hMLH1, death associated protein kinase, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31 in H. pylori dependent and independent MALT lymphomas, DLBCLs, and H. pylori associated chronic gastritis. We first confirmed that H. pylori independent cases had a high incidence of t(11;18)(q21;q21) (4/8 cases) and aberrant BCL10 expression (7/8 cases) compared with H. pylori dependent cases and gastric DLBCLs. In the methylation pattern study, all 13 H. pylori dependent MALT lymphomas had more than four methylated loci while H. pylori independent cases had less than two. According to the previous criterion, all H. pylori dependent MALT lymphomas (13/13, 100%) and five of 10 (50%) DLBCLs were classified as CpG island methylator phenotype positive (CIMP+). In contrast, all H. pylori independent MALT lymphomas were CIMP-. The distinct methylation pattern together with lack of chromosomal translocation in H. pylori dependent MALT lymphomas suggest that H. pylori dependent and independent MALT lymphomas have a different pathogenesis.	2003	06	24	Gut	Kaneko	Y
12720128	10.1053/sonc.2003.50049	Dysregulation of apoptosis in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia does not involve nuclear factor kappa B activation.	Indolent lymphoproliferative disorders such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) are characterized by defective apoptosis, which leads to progressive accumulation of slowly dividing neoplastic lymphocytes. Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is considered to have a central pathogenic role in some hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (ENMZL). NFkappaB activation may inhibit apoptosis through the transactivation of genes such as Bcl-2 and may therefore be an important mechanism in indolent lymphoproliferative disorders, including WM. In order to assess this potential mechanism, we used immunohistochemistry to determine the presence and subcellular localisation of the major NFkappaB subunits p50 and p65. Nuclear staining of NFkappaB subunits (indicative of activation) was not seen in any of the 40 cases examined. Thirty-seven (95%) cases showed cytoplasmic positivity for both p50 and p65 and one case demonstrated cytoplasmic staining for p65 alone, while the two remaining cases showed complete absence of staining. We would therefore conclude that NFkappaB activation is not a feature of WM and that alternative mechanisms of apoptosis inhibition should be investigated in this disorder.	2003	06	02	Semin Oncol	Leitch	Derek

We have reviewed the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypical, and molecular features of a series of 27 cases of nodal marginal zone lymphoma with the aim of defining this entity more precisely. The series was characterized by a relatively favorable clinical course, with a low clinical stage at diagnosis (59% patients with clinical stage I-II) and a 5-year overall survival probability of 79%. However, the disease persisted in a relatively large fraction of the patients, thus yielding a 5-year failure-free survival probability of 22%. Molecular and immunohistochemical analyses of the series revealed heterogeneity in the frequency of IgV(H) somatic mutation and in the expression of IgD, CD43, MUM1, and CD38. Apart from the absence of nuclear Bcl10, no clear distinction could be made from the expression profiling of other B-cell lymphomas claimed to be derived from marginal zone B cells. Additionally, the immunophenotype of the tumoral cells in all cases but one differed from that described in monocytoid B cells. It was characterized by a Bcl2-, p21+, cyclin E+ profile. The analysis of apoptosis-regulator proteins disclosed abnormalities in the expression of survivin and active caspase 3, which could partially explain the abnormal regulation of apoptosis observed in these tumors. Molecular and immunohistochemical data obtained in this study strongly imply that there is significant heterogeneity among the cases included in the category termed nodal marginal zone lymphoma.	2003	07	08	Am J Surg Pathol	Camacho	Francisca I

12841349		Bcl10 protein can act as a transcription activator in yeast.	The Bcl10 gene has recently been cloned from the chromosomal translocation t(1:14) (p22; q32) in a low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and was implicated in the pathogenesis of this and several other tumor types. In yeast two hybrid systems, when it was fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain of pGBT9, this fusion protein can activate the expression of reporter genes without Gal4-AD domain. Through deletion assay and secondary structure prediction, we found that the N-terminal of Bcl10 contributed more to activation than the C-terminal. It has been recently reported that Bcl10 expression is correlated with the activation of NF-kappaB in eukaryotic cells, so it may represent an important role in protein expression. Our research is the first to demonstrate a new function of Bcl10: transcription activation in yeast.	2004	03	01	Mol Cell Biochem	Chen	Ming
12867038	10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00491-3	Requirement for CARMA1 in antigen receptor-induced NF-kappa B activation and lymphocyte proliferation.	Ligation of antigen receptors (TCR, BCR) on T and B lymphocytes leads to the activation of new transcriptional programs and cell cycle progression. Antigen receptor-mediated activation of NF-kappa B, required for proliferation of B and T cells, is disrupted in T cells lacking PKC theta and in B and T cells lacking Bcl10, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing adaptor protein. CARMA1 (also called CARD11 and Bimp3), the only lymphocyte-specific member in a family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffolding proteins that interact with Bcl10 by way of CARD-CARD interactions, is required for TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Here we show that T cells from mice lacking CARMA1 expression were defective in recruitment of Bcl10 to clustered TCR complexes and lipid rafts, in activation of NF-kappa B, and in induction of IL-2 production. Development of CD5(+) peritoneal B cells was disrupted in these mice, as was B cell proliferation in response to both BCR and CD40 ligation. Serum immunoglobulin levels were also markedly reduced in the mutant mice.

Cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma is a recently proposed entity and constitutes a cutaneous counterpart of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Borrelia burgdorferi infection has been suggested as a possible causative agent in European cutaneous cases of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, whereas API2-MALT1 fusion and BCL10 mutation are highly associated with MALT lymphoma. Aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression may be closely correlated with API2-MALT1 fusion in gastric and pulmonary MALT lymphomas. We examined 24 Asian cases of cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma for B. burgdorferi involvement, API2-MALT1 fusion, BCL10 cellular expression, and BCL10 mutation. Neither Borrelia DNA nor API2-MALT1 fusion transcript was detected. Nuclear BCL10 expression was evident in tumor cells of 11 of 24 cases, although BCL10 mutation was found in one case only. Clinicopathologically, nuclear BCL10 was more frequently expressed in macroscopically nodular lesions than in plaques or papules (p = 0.0031). These data suggest that 1) B. burgdorferi infection may not play an important role in developing cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in Asian cases, 2) neither API2-MALT1 fusion nor BCL10 mutation is closely associated with the pathogenesis, 3) aberrant nuclear BCL10 may frequently be expressed in the absence of these genetic abnormalities, and 4) nuclear BCL10 expression may be clinically important because it was observed in locally aggressive tumors.	2003	09	04	Am J Surg Pathol	Li	Chunmei

12910267	10.1038/ni963	Defective development and function of Bcl10-deficient follicular, marginal zone and B1 B cells.	Bcl10 is an intracellular protein essential for nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation after lymphocyte antigen receptor stimulation. Using knockout mice, we show that absence of Bcl10 impeded conversion from transitional type 2 to mature follicular B cells and caused substantial decreases in marginal zone and B1 B cells. Bcl10-deficient B cells showed no excessive apoptosis. However, both Bcl10-deficient follicular and marginal zone B cells failed to proliferate normally, although Bcl10-deficient marginal zone B cells uniquely failed to activate NF-kappaB efficiently after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Bcl10-deficient marginal zone B cells did not capture antigens, and Bcl10-deficient (Bcl10-/-) mice failed to initiate humoral responses, leading to an inability to clear blood-borne bacteria. Thus, Bcl10 is essential for the development of all mature B cell subsets.	2003	09	30	Nat Immunol	Xue	Liquan
12950026	10.1002/path.1426	Infrequent somatic Fas mutations but no evidence of Bcl10 mutations or t(11;18) in primary cutaneous MALT-type lymphoma.	Genetic alterations that allow tumour cells to evade apoptosis have recently been identified as key features of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (MALT-type lymphoma). The t(11;18), which produces the putative anti-apoptotic fusion protein API2-MALT1, has been identified in a large proportion of extracutaneous MALT-type lymphomas and a smaller fraction of tumours harbour mutations that inactivate the pro-apoptotic functions of Fas and Bcl10. The present study has examined the status of these genes in 19 primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCLs), 12 of which were MALT-type lymphomas according to the WHO classification. None of the 19 PCBCLs carried the t(11;18) and tumour-specific Bcl10 alterations were not identified at the genomic level or at the mRNA level. Somatic Fas mutations causing truncation of the Fas receptor were identified in two MALT-type lymphomas. Both patients with Fas mutant PCBCL exhibited benign conditions of dysregulated lymphoproliferation. One had autoimmune diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis and the other had a 25-year history of recurrent cutaneous pseudo-lymphomas. It is suggested that Fas mutation permits the survival and hence the accumulation of autoreactive B cells. This expansion of autoreactive B cells is analogous to the expansion of B cells chronically stimulated by exogenous antigens in the development of MALT-type lymphoma.	2003	10	24	J Pathol	Grønbaek	Kirsten
12960515	10.1097/00001622-200309000-00001	Update: gastric MALT lymphoma.	Gastric MALT lymphoma is a model malignancy for examination of how neoplasia may arise from chronic inflammation. It is also exemplifies the translation of biologic knowledge of a disease towards improved clinical practice. Several recent publications have furthered the understanding of gastric MALT lymphoma pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and treatment. A substantial fraction of cases will harbor a balanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 18. This translocation results in the generation of a novel fusion protein, aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression, and activation of the NF-kB pathway. The result is H. pylori-independent growth and a unique clinical picture characterized by a more advanced presentation and unresponsiveness to H. pylori eradication therapy. While more likely to require cytotoxic therapy, this subtype is paradoxically less likely to undergo large-cell transformation. Finally, clinical trials are helping define the optimal role for H. pylori eradication therapy and are demonstrating that therapeutic approaches incorporating stomach conservation are preferable for those cases unresponsive to eradication therapy. The pathogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma has been elucidated to a large degree in recent years. Understanding the biology of this disease will most certainly translate into clinical practice.	2004	02	17	Curr Opin Oncol	Kahl	Brad S
14502259	10.1038/sj.thj.6200295	T(11;18)(q21;q21) in gastric MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of Chinese patients.	T(11;18)(q21;q21) occurs at variable frequencies in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas of different sites. In gastric MALT lymphoma, it occurs in 30% cases and the translocation positive tumours are frequently at advanced stages and do not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication. Intriguingly, t(11;18)(q21;q21) has been observed only rarely in mucosal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), despite that at least a proportion of these tumours are believed to be the result of transformation of an MALT lymphoma. We previously examined t(11;18)(q21;q21) in gastric MALT lymphoma of Chinese in Taiwan and found the translocation in one of the three transformed MALT lymphomas studied. To extend this observation, we have examined t(11;18)(q21;q21) in a large cohort of gastric lymphomas of Chinese in China including 39 MALT lymphomas (12 with high-grade components) and 53 DLBCL by reverse transcription and PCR. Of these cases, RNA samples extracted from 36 MALT lymphomas including 10 cases with high-grade component and 46 DLBCL were adequate for detection of the translocation as judged by control RT-PCR of a house-keeping gene. T(11;18)(q21;q21) was found in 8/36 (22%) MALT lymphomas and 1/46 (2%) DLBCL. None of the MALT lymphoma with high-grade component showed t(11;18)(q21;q21). Our results suggest that t(11;18)(q21;q21) occurs only occasionally in transformed MALT lymphoma.	2004	06	24	Hematol J	Huang	Xuebiao

14576442	10.1126/science.1090769	Regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent lymphocyte activation and development by paracaspase.	Paracaspase (MALT1), a member of an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of caspase-like proteins, has been shown to bind and colocalize with the protein Bcl10 in vitro and, because of this association, has been suggested to be involved in the CARMA1-Bcl10 pathway of antigen-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. We demonstrate that primary T and B lymphocytes from paracaspase-deficient mice are defective in antigen-receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation, cytokine production, and proliferation. Paracaspase acts downstream of Bcl10 to induce NF-kappaB activation and is required for the normal development of B cells, indicating that paracaspase provides the missing link between Bcl10 and activation of the IkappaB kinase complex.	2003	12	18	Science	Ruefli-Brasse	Astrid A
14614861	10.1016/s1074-7613(03)00293-0	Differential requirement for Malt1 in T and B cell antigen receptor signaling.	The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) involving MALT1 is the most common chromosomal abnormality in lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Although the paracaspase MALT1 can bind to BCL10, the physiological function of MALT1 is unknown. Using mouse models, we show that Malt1 is essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and IL-2 production in response to TCR ligation and strictly required for signal-specific NF-kappaB activation induced by the TCR but not TNF-alpha or IL-1 signaling. Malt1 operates downstream of Bcl10, controls the catalytic activity of the canonical IKK complex, and regulates the signaling of Jnk and p38 MAP kinases. In contrast to Bcl10 disruption, however, inactivation of Malt1 has only mild effects on B cell activation and does not cause defects during neurodevelopment. Thus, Malt1 is an essential regulator of Bcl10 signaling that is differentially required depending on cellular context.	2003	12	18	Immunity	Ruland	Jürgen
14634131	10.4049/jimmunol.171.11.6154	Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain is a regulator of procaspase-1 activation.	Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC)/target of methylation-induced silencing/PYCARD represents one of only two proteins encoded in the human genome that contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) together with a pyrin, AIM, ASC, and death domain-like (PAAD)/PYRIN/DAPIN domain. CARDs regulate caspase family proteases. We show here that ASC binds by its CARD to procaspase-1 and to adapter proteins involved in caspase-1 activation, thereby regulating cytokine pro-IL-1beta activation by this protease in THP-1 monocytes. ASC enhances IL-1beta secretion into the cell culture supernatants, at low concentrations, while suppressing at high concentrations. When expressed in HEK293 cells, ASC interferes with Cardiak/Rip2/Rick-mediated oligomerization of procaspase-1 and suppresses activation this protease, as measured by protease activity assays. Moreover, ASC also recruits procaspase-1 into ASC-formed cytosolic specks, separating it from Cardiak. We also show that expression of the PAAD/PYRIN family proteins pyrin or cryopyrin/PYPAF1/NALP3 individually inhibits IL-1beta secretion but that coexpression of ASC with these proteins results in enhanced IL-1beta secretion. However, expression of ASC uniformly interferes with caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta secretion induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as LPS and TNF, suggesting pathway competition. Moreover, LPS and TNF induce increases in ASC mRNA and protein expression in cells of myeloid/monocytic origin, revealing another level of cross-talk of cytokine-signaling pathways with the ASC-controlled pathway. Thus, our results suggest a complex interplay of the bipartite adapter protein ASC with PAAD/PYRIN family proteins, LPS (Toll family receptors), and TNF in the regulation of procaspase-1 activation, cytokine production, and control of inflammatory responses.	2004	03	01	J Immunol	Stehlik	Christian

14681324	10.1097/01.MP.0000097283.47637.58	API2-MALT1 fusion gene in colorectal lymphoma.	The API2-MALT1 fusion gene was originally identified from a t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation, a specific chromosomal abnormality that is found in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Gastric MALT lymphomas positive for the API2-MALT1 fusion gene do not respond to Helicobacter pylori-eradication therapy, but otherwise, the incidence and clinicopathological behavior of colorectal MALT lymphoma with this genetic abnormality are unclear. We examined the API2-MALT1 fusion by multiplex RT-PCR method in 47 cases of MALT lymphoma and 13 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and evaluated the relevance of API2-MALT1 positivity to the clinical and pathological features. The mean ages of MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients were 65 (range, 37-87 y) and 58 (range, 14-85 y) years, respectively. API2-MALT1 fusion genes were detected in seven cases (15%) of MALT lymphoma and one case (8%) of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In MALT lymphomas, the tumor size in API2-MALT1-positive cases was 62 +/- 39 mm (mean +/- SD), statistically larger than that in API2-MALT1-negative cases (25 +/- 19 mm; P &lt;.01). The API2-MALT1-positive cases demonstrated more advanced clinical stages and a male predominance, compared with API2-MALT1-negative cases. Thus, API2-MALT1-positive tumors should be cared for as a more aggressive subgroup and be followed for a longer time.	2004	07	28	Mod Pathol	Sakugawa	Sumie Takase
14716524	10.1007/s10120-003-0260-5	Colliding gastric and intestinal phenotype well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach developing in an area of MALT-type lymphoma.	A 73-year-old man presented with an abnormal gastric shadow during a check-up of atomic bomb survivors. Radiological examination and endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed a protruding tumor, type 0-I+IIa, on the lesser curvature of the midstomach. An initial diagnosis of early gastric cancer was made and a segmental gastrectomy was planned. However, distal gastrectomy with D3 lymph node dissection was necessary, because intraoperative frozen section showed that the paraaortic lymph nodes (N3) were positive for cancer. The tumor in the resected specimen was, microscopically, a well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1) with pT2 (MP), pN3, ly2, and v1, in final (f) stage IV. The tumor cells of the type 0-I segment appeared as gastric phenotype and those of the type 0-IIa segment as intestinal phenotype. The border between the two was distinct. The tumor had focally invaded the muscularis propria where only the gastric phenotype was shown and the histological type became less differentiated. Thus, special attention should be paid to possible unexpected deep-wall invasion and lymph node metastasis in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas of the gastric phenotype. Further, in this patient, diffusely proliferating low-grade lymphoma was also observed incidentally in the gastric mucosa within and around the carcinoma. This was diagnosed as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma with aberrant expression of BCL10. Finally, this case was considered to be a colliding gastric and intestinal phenotype well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach developed in an area involved by MALT-type lymphoma. Because no Helicobacter pylori was detected throughout the mucosae and the patient had no history of its infection, the three tumors may have developed under the same conditions as those seen in Helicobacter pylori infection, but without this infection.	2004	04	02	Gastric Cancer	Suenaga	Mitsukuni
15202520	10.1080/10428190310001623793	Molecular pathogenesis of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.	Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type occur in a number of anatomic sites, but share overlapping morphological and immunophenotypic features. Helicobacter pylori infection has been identified as an etiological factor in gastric MALT lymphoma, but the cause of MALT lymphomas at other sites remains a matter of speculation. Despite these limitations in understanding the etiology of MALT lymphoma, standard cytogenetic analysis has proved useful by demonstrating similar alterations in MALT lymphomas from different anatomic sites. The common cytogenetic alterations that characterize MALT lymphomas include t(11:18)(q21:q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32) and, more recently, t(14;18)(q32;q21). The apparent complexity of the cytogenetic alterations that have now been implicated in the pathogenesis of extranodal MALT lymphoma serves as a paradigm for molecular cross talk in neoplastic disease. Recent data have shown that these very disparate translocations affect a common signaling mechanism, and thus unify all three under a common pathogenesis, resulting in the constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway.	2004	10	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Gascoyne	Randy D
11748643	10.1002/path.1015	BCL10 in malignant lymphomas--an evaluation using fluorescence in situ hybridization.	BCL10 is a tumour suppressor gene originally cloned from a t(1;14)(p22;q32) breakpoint in a case of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Translocations involving this gene, though uncommon, are sometimes encountered in MALT lymphomas. This gene is thought to play an important role in the development of malignant lymphomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was therefore undertaken on 22 cases of malignant lymphoma of varying histology to establish the incidence of rearrangements involving the BCL10 gene. Initially, one case with a novel t(1;2)(p22;p12) translocation involving the BCL10 gene was identified, in a marginal zone lymphoma of the MALT type, and was reported elsewhere. Seven other cases were subsequently identified with abnormalities in the 1p region, including a translocation with a breakpoint in the 1p22 region in a case of lymphoblastic lymphoma. However, none of these involved the BCL10 gene. Mutation analysis of BCL10 was then performed on 57 cases of malignant lymphoma, including 17 MALT lymphomas, by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of tumour DNA. Tissue was obtained for mutation analysis for 12 of the 22 cases analysed by FISH. Selected cases with SSCP band shifts were further studied by direct sequencing. Polymorphisms were identified in eight cases, but no mutations of pathogenic significance were identified. Further RT-PCR and mutation analysis was performed on cDNAs from 12 cases (four MALT, seven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, one Hodgkin's disease) in which DNA analysis had already been completed. This included the MALT lymphoma with the t(1;2)(p22;p12) rearrangement. Again, no mutations were identified in the coding sequence. This study confirms that rearrangements of the BCL10 gene are uncommon in lymphoma (1/22) and may be limited tothe MALT subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. It was also found that breakpoints or rearrangements in the 1p22 region do not necessarily involve the BCL10 gene. Moreover, the absence of mutations at both the DNA (0/60) and the mRNA (0/12) level indicates that this gene is not frequently inactivated by mutation, in those tumours in which it is not involved in translocations. Our findings suggest that the BCL10 gene is unlikely to have a frequent or key role in general lymphomagenesis.	2002	02	04	J Pathol	Achuthan	R
11753078	10.1097/00062752-200201000-00009	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	Since the first description of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in 1983 rapid advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis and underlying molecular events associated with the development of this tumor. Lymphoma arises at extranodal sites in which a pre-existing inflammatory response has provoked the acquisition of organized lymphoid tissue. Specific molecular events have been associated with the development of MALT lymphoma including t(11;18) and alterations in Bcl-10 protein expression, and these appear to be interlinked. In gastric MALT lymphoma Helicobacter pylori is the most common stimulus for the acquisition of lymphoid tissue. Eradication of this organism has been shown to result in regression of the tumor in many cases, but there are a few that will not respond to this approach. Predicting those cases unlikely to respond to H pylori eradication alone has been investigated in a number of ways. An underlying t(11;18) within the tumor cells appears to predict for a lack of response. Clinical measurement of the depth of infiltration of the wall by gastric MALT lymphoma as measured by endoscopic ultrasound has been less clear. More superficial tumors are more likely to respond, but regression has been reported even in cases with local lymph node involvement. For superficial lymphomas at other sites alternatives to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgery have been sought. Local injections of interferon (IF) alpha have been successful in treating conjunctival lymphoma, and this approach may be of use for other superficial lesions.	2002	02	06	Curr Opin Hematol	Wotherspoon	Andrew Charles

11830492	10.1182/blood.v99.4.1398	BCL10 mutation does not represent an important pathogenic mechanism in gastric MALT-type lymphoma, and the presence of the API2-MLT fusion is associated with aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression.	Two recurrent translocations have been associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma, t(11;18)(q21;q21) and t(1;14)(p22;q32). The first, t(11;18)(q21;q21), results in the fusion protein API2-MLT (API2-MALT1). Through t(1;14)(p22;q32), the BCL10 gene is entirely transferred to the IgH gene, resulting in its overexpression. Wild-type BCL10 is implicated in apoptosis, and it has been suggested that mutated forms gain oncogenic activity. The occurrence of genomic BCL10 mutations in 35 gastric MALT-type lymphomas with or without t(11;18)(q21;q21) (10 and 25 cases, respectively) was investigated. DNA extracted from either whole tissue sections or microdissected clusters of tumor cells was used. Five polymerase chain reactions amplifying the coding exons were performed and were followed by direct sequencing of the products. Twenty differences with the published BCL10 sequence, all single nucleotide substitutions, were detected in 16 cases. Of these, 12 represented known polymorphisms, either at codon 8, 213, or 5. Of the remaining 8 substitutions, 2 were silent and 6 resulted in amino acid substitutions. Mutation analysis results were correlated with the BCL10 expression pattern. Aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression was detected in 14 cases. No association could be demonstrated between the latter and the presence of BCL10 mutations. In contrast, all 10 cases carrying t(11;18)(q21;q21) showed nuclear expression, whereas this staining pattern was absent in 21 of 25 cases without t(11;18)(q21;q21). These results demonstrate that BCL10 mutations are rare in gastric MALT-type lymphoma and are not related to the aberrant nuclear expression of BCL10. In contrast, they indicate that the presence of the API2-MLT fusion protein is associated with aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression.	2002	04	25	Blood	Maes	Brigitte
11836626		Lack of Bcl10 mutations in malignant cartilaginous tumors.	The Bcl10 gene was recently isolated from the breakpoint region of t(1;14)(p22;q32) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Somatic mutations of Bcl10 were found in not only t(1;14)-bearing MALT lymphomas, but also a wide range of other tumors. To clarify the actual frequency and spectrum of Bcl10 mutations in primary malignant chondrogenic tumors, we examined 89 cases of malignant chondrogenic tumors comprising 17 conventional chondrosarcomas, 33 mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, and 39 clear cell chondrosarcomas. Polymerase chain reaction single-stranded conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses were done. No Bcl10 mutations were found in our series of malignant chondrogenic tumors. While screening for mutations, we also found three polymorphisms at codons 8 exon 1 of the Bcl10 gene. Our results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of Bcl10 are extremely rare in malignant cartilaginous tumors and do not commonly contribute to their molecular pathogenesis.	2002	04	30	Int J Mol Med	Park	Yong-Koo
11850073	10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00548-9	Cytogenetic characterization of diffuse large cell lymphoma using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization.	We have employed multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) to characterize the cytogenetic changes in 20 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), that contained complex and partially characterized karyotypes. The M-FISH analysis helped to delineate 94% of the unidentified abnormalities and assisted in redefining some unidentified/misidentified karyotypic changes. Recurrent breakpoints observed in approximately 20% cases included 14q32, 3p21, 3q27, 22q12, 1q25, and 18q21 (in decreasing order), and 1p22, 1q21, 4q31, 6q21, and 8q24 (in four cases each). Numerical gain of chromosomes 7, 9, 12, and X and loss of chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 17, and Y, were noted in approximately 20% of cases. The minimum deleted regions encompassed 6q21-q25, 1p22-p36, 1q32-q44, 2p23-p25, 4q31-q35, 13p13-q14, and 17p11-p13. Two cases presented with a sole structural abnormality, and one contained a der(17)t(9;17)(p21;p13), which has not been reported earlier as a sole abnormality in DLBCL. Upon completely characterizing the karyotypes, we observed with interesting that in 55% of the cases, more than one BCL gene bearing regions was involved in translocations. In the remaining 45%, where only one or none of the BCL gene regions was involved in a rearrangement, we observed the loss of chromosomes 6 and/or 17 or partial deletions of 6q and/or 17p or gain of 7 and/or 12. Our findings suggest that, although BCL2 and BCL6 are most often implicated in DLBCL, the possibility of the disruptions of BCL3, BCL8, BCL9, and BCL10 as a ""primary event"" in DLBCL cannot be ruled out. Most often, a combination of events may be necessary for the genesis of DLBCL or progression of follicular lymphoma to DLBCL. Overall, M-FISH has enhanced our ability to provide a comprehensive karyotypic analysis, and has helped in defining the importance of BCL3, BCL8, BCL9, and BCL10 carrying breakpoints in DLBCL.	2002	03	20	Cancer Genet Cytogenet	Dave	Bhavana J

12017308		Lack of BCL10 mRNA mutation in lymphold malignancies.	BCL10, a gene involved in the chromosomal translocation t(1;14)(p22;q32) found in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT lymphoma), has shown mutation in not only MALT lymphomas but also other lymphold tumors. However, the mutation rate remains controversial. One possible reason is variation in the source material (DNA or RNA), with most studies having been done using tumor DNA. Accordingly, we studied BCL10 mutations using tumor RNA. Fifty lymphoid malignancies (26 malignant lymphomas, 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemias and 14 acute lymphoblastic leukemias) were examined. Total RNA was extracted from the tumor cells and first-strand cDNA was subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism and fragment length analysis. Then the results were confirmed by direct sequencing. No mutations of the BCL10 gene were found in the 50 samples. There were four polymorphisms (3G to T, 24G to C, 485C to T and 638G to A). All samples showed at least one 24C allele. The BCL10 mutations studied are rare events at the RNA level and may not be associated with the mechanism of tumorigenesis in most lymphoid tumors.	2002	06	25	Anticancer Res	Kawano	Takeshi
12091384	10.1074/jbc.M202222200	Protein kinase C-associated kinase (PKK) mediates Bcl10-independent NF-kappa B activation induced by phorbol ester.	Protein kinase C-associated kinase (PKK) is a recently described kinase of unknown function that was identified on the basis of its specific interaction with PKC beta. PKK contains N-terminal kinase and C-terminal ankyrin repeats domains linked to an intermediate region. Here we report that the kinase domain of PKK is highly homologous to that of two mediators of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation, RICK and RIP, but these related kinases have different C-terminal domains for binding to upstream factors. We find that expression of PKK, like RICK and RIP, induces NF-kappa B activation. Mutational analysis revealed that the kinase domain of PKK is essential for NF-kappa B activation, whereas replacement of serine residues in the putative activation loop did not affect the ability of PKK to activate NF-kappa B. A catalytic inactive PKK mutant inhibited NF-kappa B activation induced by phorbol ester and Ca(2+)-ionophore, but it did not block that mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, or Nod1. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by dominant negative PKK was reverted by co-expression of PKC beta I, suggesting a functional association between PKK and PKC beta I. PKK-mediated NF-kappa B activation required IKK alpha and IKK beta but not IKK gamma, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. Moreover, NF-kappa B activation induced by PKK was not inhibited by dominant negative Bimp1 and proceeded in the absence of Bcl10, two components of a recently described PKC signaling pathway. These results suggest that PKK is a member of the RICK/RIP family of kinases, which is involved in a PKC-activated NF-kappa B signaling pathway that is independent of Bcl10 and IKK gamma.	2002	10	17	J Biol Chem	Muto	Akihiro
12154356	10.1038/ni824	A requirement for CARMA1 in TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation.	Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex initiates multiple signaling cascades that lead to the activation of several transcription factors, including the NF-kappa B family members. Although various proximal signaling components of the TCR have been intensively studied, the distal components that mediate TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation remain largely unknown. Using a somatic mutagenesis approach, we cloned a CARMA1-deficient T cell line. Deficiency in CARMA1 (originally known as CARDII) resulted in selectively impaired activation of NF-kappa B induced by the TCR and a consequent defect in interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Reconstitution of the CARMA1-deficient cells with CARMA1 fully rescued this signaling defect. Together, our results show that CARMA1 is an essential signaling component that mediates TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation.	2002	09	19	Nat Immunol	Wang	Donghai
12154360	10.1038/ni830	CARMA1 is a critical lipid raft-associated regulator of TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation.	CARMA1 is a lymphocyte-specific member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of scaffolding proteins, which coordinate signaling pathways emanating from the plasma membrane. CARMA1 interacts with Bcl10 via its caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). Here we investigated the role of CARMA1 in T cell activation and found that T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation induced a physical association of CARMA1 with the TCR and Bcl10. We found that CARMA1 was constitutively associated with lipid rafts, whereas cytoplasmic Bcl10 translocated into lipid rafts upon TCR engagement. A CARMA1 mutant, defective for Bcl10 binding, had a dominant-negative (DN) effect on TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation and IL-2 production and on the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (Jnk) pathway when the TCR was coengaged with CD28. Together, our data show that CARMA1 is a critical lipid raft-associated regulator of TCR-induced NF-kappa B activation and CD28 costimulation-dependent Jnk activation.	2002	09	19	Nat Immunol	Gaide	Olivier
12389689	10.1258/00222150260171605	Lack of Bcl10 gene mutations in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.	The Bcl10 gene encodes a protein probably involved in some apoptotic regulatory pathways. Bcl10 mutations lead to the translation of truncated proteins that show gain-of-function transforming activity; it has been suggested that Bcl10 may represent a major target gene for inactivation in many human cancers. To define the frequency of Bcl10 mutations in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and their possible association with tumour progression, we investigated a large panel of tumours representative of all grades and stages of malignancy. To detect pathogenic mutations in exons 1, 2 and 3 of the Bcl10 gene, we performed a silver-staining polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing. We revealed the presence of SSCP variants in 18 out of 91 laryngeal tumours. Direct DNA sequencing showed previously described polymorphisms but no pathogenic mutations. We have strong evidence that the Bcl10 gene is not involved in laryngeal carcinogenesis.	2002	11	29	J Laryngol Otol	Ronchetti	Domenica
14993411	10.1124/mi.2.6.356	Determining the destiny of NF-kappa B after TCR ligation: it's CARMA1.	In T lymphocytes, the ""novel"" protein kinase C theta (PKC theta) isoform and the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) are required for cell proliferation and the production of cytokines in response to T cell activation; however, the molecular interactions that link PKCtheta and NF-kappaB have remained unknown. Two recent reports demonstrate that CARMA1 (caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein-1) bridges the gap between PKCtheta and the IkappaB kinase (IKK)-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in T cells. Excessive T lymphocyte activation and proliferation are hallmarks of T cell-derived leukemias. Given that CARMA1 is specifically expressed in lymphoid tissues, could pharmacological inhibitors be designed to inhibit CARMA1's (or PKCtheta's) ability to promote the activation of NF-kappaB?	2004	06	09	Mol Interv	Bunnell	Stephen C
11163238	10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00189-1	Bcl10 is a positive regulator of antigen receptor-induced activation of NF-kappaB and neural tube closure.	Bcl10, a CARD-containing protein identified from the t(1;14)(p22;q32) breakpoint in MALT lymphomas, has been shown to induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappaB in vitro. We show that one-third of bcl10-/- embryos developed exencephaly, leading to embryonic lethality. Surprisingly, bcl10-/- cells retained susceptibility to various apoptotic stimuli in vivo and in vitro. However, surviving bcl10-/- mice were severely immunodeficient and bcl10-/- lymphocytes are defective in antigen receptor or PMA/Ionomycin-induced activation. Early tyrosine phosphorylation, MAPK and AP-1 activation, and Ca2+ signaling were normal in mutant lymphocytes, but antigen receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation was absent. Thus, Bcl10 functions as a positive regulator of lymphocyte proliferation that specifically connects antigen receptor signaling in B and T cells to NF-kappaB activation.	2001	03	22	Cell	Ruland	J
11238466	10.1083/jcb.152.5.1115	Equine herpesvirus protein E10 induces membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of its cellular homologue, bcl-10.	v-E10, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing gene product of equine herpesvirus 2, is the viral homologue of the bcl-10 protein whose gene was found to be translocated in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. v-E10 efficiently activates the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 stress kinase, and the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcriptional pathway and interacts with its cellular homologue, bcl-10, via a CARD-mediated interaction. Here we demonstrate that v-E10 contains a COOH-terminal geranylgeranylation consensus site which is responsible for its plasma membrane localization. Expression of v-E10 induces hyperphosphorylation and redistribution of bcl-10 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, a process which is dependent on the intactness of the v-E10 CARD motif. Both membrane localization and a functional CARD motif are important for v-E10-mediated NF-kappaB induction, but not for JNK activation, which instead requires a functional v-E10 binding site for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6. Moreover, v-E10-induced NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by a dominant negative version of the bcl-10 binding protein TRAF1, suggesting that v-E10-induced membrane recruitment of cellular bcl-10 induces constitutive TRAF-mediated NF-kappaB activation.	2001	05	17	J Cell Biol	Thome	M
11259443	10.1074/jbc.M102488200	Card10 is a novel caspase recruitment domain/membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member that interacts with BCL10 and activates NF-kappa B.	BCL10 belongs to the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of proteins that regulate apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Analysis of BCL10-deficient mice has revealed that BCL10 mediates NF-kappaB activation by antigen receptors in B and T cells. We recently identified a subclass of CARD proteins (CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14) that may function to connect BCL10 to multiple upstream signaling pathways. We report here that CARD10 is a novel BCL10 interactor that belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, a class of proteins that function to organize signaling complexes at plasma membranes. When expressed in cells, CARD10 binds to BCL10 and signals the activation of NF-kappaB through its N-terminal effector CARD domain. We propose that CARD10 functions as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of a BCL10 signaling complex that activates NF-kappaB.	2001	07	19	J Biol Chem	Wang	L
11262391	10.1074/jbc.M009984200	Bcl10 and MALT1, independent targets of chromosomal translocation in malt lymphoma, cooperate in a novel NF-kappa B signaling pathway.	At least two distinct recurrent chromosomal translocations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma. The first, t(1;14), results in the transfer of the entire Bcl10 gene to chromosome 14 wherein Bcl10 expression is inappropriately stimulated by the neighboring Ig enhancer. The second, t(11;18), results in the synthesis of a novel fusion protein, API2-MALT1. Until now, no common mechanism of action has been proposed to explain how the products of these seemingly unrelated translocations may contribute to the same malignant process. We show here that Bcl10 and MALT1 form a strong and specific complex within the cell, and that these proteins synergize in the activation of NF-kappaB. The data support a mechanism of action whereby Bcl10 mediates the oligomerization and activation of the MALT1 caspase-like domain. This subsequently activates the IKK complex through an unknown mechanism, setting in motion a cascade of events leading to NF-kappaB induction. Furthermore, the API2-MALT1 fusion protein also strongly activates NF-kappaB and shows dependence upon the same downstream signaling factors. We propose a model whereby both the Bcl10.MALT1 complex and the API2-MALT1 fusion protein activate a common downstream signaling pathway that originates with the oligomerization-dependent activation of the MALT1 caspase-like domain.	2001	07	26	J Biol Chem	Lucas	P C
11278692	10.1074/jbc.M010512200	CARD11 and CARD14 are novel caspase recruitment domain (CARD)/membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family members that interact with BCL10 and activate NF-kappa B.	The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein-binding module that mediates the assembly of CARD-containing proteins into apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling complexes. We report here that CARD protein 11 (CARD11) and CARD protein 14 (CARD14) are novel CARD-containing proteins that belong to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, a class of proteins that functions as molecular scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at specialized regions of the plasma membrane. CARD11 and CARD14 have homologous structures consisting of an N-terminal CARD domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite domain comprised of a PDZ domain, an Src homology 3 domain, and a GUK domain with homology to guanylate kinase. The CARD domains of both CARD11 and CARD14 associate specifically with the CARD domain of BCL10, a signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB through the IkappaB kinase complex in response to upstream stimuli. When expressed in cells, CARD11 and CARD14 activate NF-kappaB and induce the phosphorylation of BCL10. These findings suggest that CARD11 and CARD14 are novel MAGUK family members that function as upstream activators of BCL10 and NF-kappaB signaling.	2001	05	24	J Biol Chem	Bertin	J
11356195	10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02414-0	Carma1, a CARD-containing binding partner of Bcl10, induces Bcl10 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation.	Bcl10, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein identified from a breakpoint in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B lymphomas, is essential for antigen-receptor-mediated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in lymphocytes. We have identified a novel CARD-containing protein and interaction partner of Bcl10, named Carma1. Carma1 is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes and represents a new member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family. Carma1 binds Bcl10 via its CARD motif and induces translocation of Bcl10 from the cytoplasm into perinuclear structures. Moreover, expression of Carma1 induces phosphorylation of Bcl10 and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We propose that Carma1 is a crucial component of a novel Bcl10-dependent signaling pathway in T-cells that leads to the activation of NF-kappaB.	2001	06	28	FEBS Lett	Gaide	O
11387339	10.1074/jbc.M103824200	Bimp1, a MAGUK family member linking protein kinase C activation to Bcl10-mediated NF-kappaB induction.	Bcl10 and MALT1, products of distinct chromosomal translocations in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, cooperate in activating NF-kappaB. Mice lacking Bcl10 demonstrate severe immunodeficiency associated with failure of lymphocytes to activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in response to antigen receptor stimulation and protein kinase C activation. We characterize Bimp1, a new signaling protein that binds Bcl10 and activates NF-kappaB. Bimp1-mediated NF-kappaB activation requires Bcl10 and IkappaB kinases, indicating that Bimp1 acts upstream of these mediators. Bimp1, Bcl10, and MALT1 form a ternary complex, with Bcl10 bridging the Bimp1/MALT1 interaction. A dominant negative Bimp1 mutant inhibits NF-kappaB activation by anti-CD3 ligation, phorbol ester, and protein kinase C expression. These results suggest that Bimp1 links surface receptor stimulation and protein kinase C activation to Bcl10/MALT1, thus leading to NF-kappaB induction.	2001	09	06	J Biol Chem	McAllister-Lucas	L M
11466612	10.1038/sj.onc.1204576	Interchangeable binding of Bcl10 to TRAF2 and cIAPs regulates apoptosis signaling.	Bcl10 was identified as a candidate gene responsible for low grade B cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Overexpression of Bcl10 in cultured cells was reported to promote apoptosis, however, the mechanism of regulation of apoptosis mediated by Bcl10 has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we analysed the apoptosis signaling pathway mediated by Bcl10, focusing on phosphorylation of Bcl10 and the dynamic interaction with its binding partners during apoptosis. Previously, we have demonstrated that Bcl10 potentially interacts with the other apoptosis regulator, TNF receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs). The present results showed that the complex formation of these molecules was regulated by phosphorylation of Bcl10, that is, phosphorylation of Bcl10 resulted in binding of Bcl10 to cIAPs and the dissociation of it from TRAF2. Moreover, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl10 enhanced apoptosis, suggesting that changes in the binding partners of Bcl10 were correlated to the promotion of apoptosis as mediated by Bcl10. Indeed, the mutant which was deleted from the binding site of Bcl10 for cIAPs, could not induce apoptosis. These findings indicate that Bcl10 is a mediator of apoptosis signaling, by switching over binding to cIAPs from TRAF2 through the events of Bcl10 phosphorylation.	2001	08	09	Oncogene	Yui	D
11605060	10.3892/or.8.6.1333	Absence of Bcl10 gene mutations in Ewing's sarcomas.	The Bcl10 gene was recently isolated from the breakpoint region of t(1;14)(p22;q32) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Somatic mutations of Bcl10 were found in not only t(1;14)-bearing MALT lymphomas, but also a wide range of other tumors. To clarify the actual frequency and spectrum of Bcl10 mutations in primary malignant Ewing's sarcomas, we examined 31 cases of Ewing's sarcomas. Polymerase chain reaction single-stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing analyses were done. No Bcl10 mutations were found in our series of Ewing's sarcomas. While screening for mutations, we found three polymorphisms at codons 8 exon 1 of the Bcl10 gene. Our results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of Bcl10 are extremely rare in Ewing's sarcomas and do not commonly contribute to their molecular pathogenesis.	2001	12	07	Oncol Rep	Park	Y K
11707622	10.1097/00125480-200111000-00001	Marginal-zone B-cell lymphoma of extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type: molecular genetics provides new insights into pathogenesis.	Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type is recognized as a distinct clinicopathologic entity in the revised European-American lymphoma (REAL) and recently published World Health Organization (WHO) classifications. These neoplasms are thought to arise from the extranodal equivalent of the lymph node marginal zone. Two recurrent chromosomal translocations, to date, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. The t(11;18)(q21;q21), which is far more common, disrupts the api2 gene on chromosome 11q21 and the malt1 (mlt) gene on chromosome 18q21, resulting in the synthesis of a novel fusion gene and protein, API2-MALT1. The t(1;14)(p22;q32), which is uncommon, juxtaposes the bcl-10 gene on chromosome 1p22 adjacent to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene on chromosome 14, wherein BCL10 is overexpressed via the influence of the IgH enhancer. BCL-10 may then form a complex with MALT1 in the cell. Both translocations result in increased inhibition of apoptosis, conferring a survival advantage. Recent work suggests that API2-MALT1 and BCL-10-MALT1 may activate NF-kB and a common downstream signaling pathway.	2002	01	30	Adv Anat Pathol	Vega	F
11722987	10.1182/asheducation-2001.1.241	MALT Lymphomas.	This review addresses the biology and the treatment of lymphomas arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This entity, first described in 1983, represents about 8% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and was recently re-classified as ""extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of MALT-type."" The term marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) encompasses the three closely related lymphoma subtypes of nodal, primary splenic and extranodal lymphomas of MALT type: the latter represent the vast majority of MZL. These lymphomas arise at different anatomic sites, are composed of mature B-cells lacking expression of CD5 and CD10, often present with overlapping morphologic features, but typically quite distinct clinical behaviors. Only very recently cytogenetic/molecular genetic observations have underlined the distinctiveness of these three lymphoid neoplasms, which in both the R.E.A.L. and WHO-classifications are included in the general term of MZL. MALT lymphomas arise in numerous extranodal sites, but gastric MALT lymphoma is the most common and best studied and is, therefore, the paradigm for the group as a whole. Dr. Isaacson describes the principal histological features of these lymphomas, including criteria to distinguish this entity from other small B-cell lymphomas. Several lines of evidence suggest that gastric lymphoma arises from MALT acquired as the result of aH. pyloriinfection. However, at least 1/3 of cases do not respond to eradication ofH. pylori. Very recent data suggest that both t(11;18) (q21;q21) and bcl10 nuclear expression are associated with failure to respond to this treatment. Dr. Gascoyne discusses the biologic function of proteins deregulated through the different translocations, which play a role in pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas, emphasizing particularly their influence in disrupting the apoptotic pathway. Dr. Zucca reviews findings suggesting that MALT lymphoma is an antigen driven neoplasm. He also presents specific guidelines for treatment of gastric lymphomas trying to shed some light on the amazingly inconsistent and confusing data in the literature. Taking advantage on the more than 300 non-gastric MALT lymphomas collected by the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (ILESG), Dr. Cavalli compares gastric lymphomas with those arising in many other sites. Overall, the data presented in this session will underline the fact, that MALT lymphomas are characterized by some unique biological properties.	2002	07	17	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Cavalli	F
11780342		bcl 10 gene mutation in hepatocellular carcinoma.	To detect the mutation frequency of the bcl 10 gene in the early and advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genome DNA samples were extracted from 46 cases of fresh HCC tumor tissues and their non-tumor adjacent tissues. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method was used to detect point mutations of the three exons of the bcl 10 gene. For each individual exon, six random samples from those showing abnormal DNA bands were sequenced to verify those mutations. The relationship between serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and bcl 10 mutation, between the tumor size and bcl 10 mutation was also analyzed. Among the 46 samples, 26 cases (56.5%) were found to have mutations in exon 1, 5 out of the 6 cases were shown to have 5744 C--&gt;G mutation by sequencing; 25 cases (54.3%) were found to have mutations in exon 2, 4 out of the 6 cases were shown to have 11,311 T deletion mutation by sequencing. Twenty-one cases (45.7%) were found to have mutations in exon 3, all of the 6 cases selected for sequencing were shown to have 14,116 C--&gt;T mutation. Statistical analysis showed that neither serum alpha-fetoprotein level nor the size of hepatocellular carcinoma has a significant relationship with bcl 10 mutation. The bcl 10 gene has a high mutation frequency in liver cancer.	2002	02	21	Chin Med J (Engl)	Cheng	J
10753917	10.1074/jbc.275.15.11114	Regulatory mechanisms of TRAF2-mediated signal transduction by Bcl10, a MALT lymphoma-associated protein.	To elucidate the function of Bcl10, recently cloned as an apoptosis-associated gene mutated in MALT lymphoma, we identified its binding partner TRAF2, which mediates signaling via tumor necrosis factor receptors. In mammalian cells, low levels of Bcl10 expression promoted the binding of TRAF2 and c-IAPs. Conversely, excessive expression inhibited complex formation. Overexpressed Bcl10 reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and induced nuclear factor kappaB activation downstream of TRAF2. To determine whether overexpression of Bcl10 could perturb the regulation of apoptosis in vivo, we generated Bcl10 transgenic mice. In these transgenic mice, atrophy of the thymus and spleen was observed at postnatal stages. The morphological changes in these tissues were caused by acceleration of apoptosis in T cells and B cells. The phenotype of Bcl10 transgenic mice was similar to that of TRAF2-deficient mice reported previously, indicating that excessive expression of Bcl10 might deplete the TRAF2 function. In contrast, in the other organs such as the brain, where Bcl10 was expressed at high levels, no apoptosis was detected. The altered sensitivities to overexpressed Bcl10 may have been due to differences in signal responses to Bcl10 among cell types. Thus, Bcl10 was suggested to play crucial roles in the modulation of apoptosis associated with TRAF2.	2000	05	05	J Biol Chem	Yoneda	T
11021819	10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64630-5	BCL10 expression in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue. Nuclear localization in MALT lymphoma.	BCL10 is an apoptotic regulatory molecule identified through its direct involvement in t(1;14)(p22;q32) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. We examined BCL10 protein expression in various normal tissues and B-cell lymphomas by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues using mouse BCL10 monoclonal antibodies. BCL10 protein was expressed in lymphoid tissue but not in 21 various other tissues with the exception of breast. In normal B-cell follicles, the protein was expressed abundantly in the germinal center B cells, moderately in the marginal zone, but only weakly in the mantle zone B cells. Irrespective of their stage of B-cell maturation, BCL10 was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, each of the four MALT lymphomas with t(1;14)(p22;q32) showed strong BCL10 expression in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Twenty of 36 (55%) MALT lymphomas lacking the translocation exhibited BCL10 expression in both the nucleus and cytoplasm although at a much lower level, whereas the remaining 16 cases displayed only cytoplasmic BCL10. Unlike MALT lymphoma, both follicular and mantle cell lymphomas generally displayed BCL10 expression compatible to their normal cell counterparts. Our results show differential expression of BCL10 protein among various B-cell populations of the B-cell follicle, indicating its importance in B-cell maturation. The subcellular localization of BCL10 was frequently altered in MALT lymphoma in comparison with its normal cell counterparts, suggesting that ectopic BCL10 expression may be important in the development of this type of tumor.	2000	10	25	Am J Pathol	Ye	H
11053425	10.1074/jbc.C000726200	CARD9 is a novel caspase recruitment domain-containing protein that interacts with BCL10/CLAP and activates NF-kappa B.	BCL10/CLAP is an activator of apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and has been implicated in B cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Although its role in apoptosis remains to be determined, BCL10 likely activates NF-kappaB through the IKK complex in response to upstream stimuli. The N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of BCL10 has been proposed to function as an activation domain that mediates homophilic interactions with an upstream CARD-containing NF-kappaB activator. To identify upstream signaling partners of BCL10, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and identified CARD9 as a novel CARD-containing protein that interacts selectively with the CARD activation domain of BCL10. When expressed in cells, CARD9 binds to BCL10 and activates NF-kappaB. Furthermore, endogenous CARD9 is found associated with BCL10 suggesting that both proteins form a pre-existing signaling complex within cells. CARD9 also self-associates and contains extensive coiled-coil motifs that may function as oligomerization domains. We propose here that CARD9 is an upstream activator of BCL10 and NF-kappaB signaling.	2001	01	26	J Biol Chem	Bertin	J
11090634	10.1016/s1097-2765(00)00094-0	Identification of paracaspases and metacaspases: two ancient families of caspase-like proteins, one of which plays a key role in MALT lymphoma.	Caspases are cysteine proteases essential to apoptosis. We have identified two families of caspase-like proteins, Paracaspases (found in metazoans and Dictyostelium) and metacaspases (found in plants, fungi, and protozoa). Metazoan paracaspase prodomains contain a death domain and immunoglobulin domains. Several plant metacaspase prodomains contain zinc finger motifs resembling those in the plant hypersensitive response/cell death protein Isd-1. The human paracaspase prodomain binds Bcl10, a protein involved in the t(1;14)(p22;q32) translocation of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Another MALT lymphoma translocation, t(11;18)(q21;q21), fuses the IAP-2 gene to the MLT1/MALT1 locus, which encodes the human paracaspase. We find that this fusion activates NF-kappaB and that the caspase domain is required for this function, since mutation of the conserved catalytic cysteine attenuates NF-kappaB activation.	2000	12	07	Mol Cell	Uren	A G
11701542	10.1182/asheducation-2000.1.180	Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Molecular Features of B Cell Lymphoma.	The rapid increase in the incidence of the B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in their development renders timely a review of the theoretical and practical aspects of molecular abnormalities in B cell NHL. In Section I, Dr. Macintyre addresses the practical aspects of the use of molecular techniques for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with B cell NHL. While detection of clonal Ig rearrangements is widely used to distinguish reactive from malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, molecular informativity is variable. The relative roles of cytogenetic, molecular and immunological techniques in the detection of genetic abnormalities and their protein products varies with the clinical situation. Consequently, the role of molecular analysis relative to morphological classification is evolving. Integrated diagnostic services are best equipped to cope with these changes. Recent evidence that large scale gene expression profiling allows improved prognostic stratification of diffuse large cell lymphoma suggests that the choice of diagnostic techniques will continue to change significantly and rapidly. In Section II, Dr. Willerford reviews current understanding of the mechanisms involved in immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement during B lymphoid development and the way in which these processes may contribute to Ig-locus chromosome translocations in lymphoma. Recent insights into the regulation of Ig gene diversification indicate that genetic plasticity in B lymphocytes is much greater than previously suspected. Physiological genomic instability, which may include isotype switching, recombination revision and somatic mutation, occurs in germinal centers in the context of immune responses and may explain longstanding clinical observations that link immunity and lymphoid neoplasia. Data from murine models and human disorders predisposing to NHL have been used to illustrate these issues. In Section III, Dr. Morris reviews the characteristics and consequences of deregulation of novel ""proto-oncogenes"" involved in B cell NHL, including PAX5 (chromosome 9p 13), BCL8 (15q11-q13), BCL9, MUC1, FcgammaRIIB and other 1q21-q22 genes and BCL10 (1p22). The AP12-MLT/MALT1 [t(11;18)(q21;q21)] fusion transcript is also described.	2019	11	20	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Macintyre	Elizabeth
10187770	10.1074/jbc.274.15.9955	CIPER, a novel NF kappaB-activating protein containing a caspase recruitment domain with homology to Herpesvirus-2 protein E10.	We have identified and characterized CIPER, a novel protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) in its N terminus and a C-terminal region rich in serine and threonine residues. The CARD of CIPER showed striking similarity to E10, a product of the equine herpesvirus-2. CIPER formed homodimers via its CARD and interacted with viral E10 but not with several apoptosis regulators containing CARDs including ARC, RAIDD, RICK, caspase-2, caspase-9, or Apaf-1. Expression of CIPER induced NF-kappaB activation, which was inhibited by dominant-negative NIK and a nonphosphorylable IkappaB-alpha mutant but not by dominant-negative RIP. Mutational analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of CIPER containing the CARD was sufficient and necessary for NF-kappaB-inducing activity. Point mutations in highly conserved residues in the CARD of CIPER disrupted the ability of CIPER to activate NF-kappaB and to form homodimers, indicating that the CARD is essential for NF-kappaB activation and dimerization.

We have previously reported on the death effector domain containing E8 gene product from equine herpesvirus-2, designated FLICE inhibitory protein (v-FLIP), and on its cellular homologue, c-FLIP, which inhibit the activation of caspase-8 by death receptors. Here we report on the structure and function of the E10 gene product of equine herpesvirus-2, designated v-CARMEN, and on its cellular homologue, c-CARMEN, which contain a caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) motif. c-CARMEN is highly homologous to the viral protein in its N-terminal CARD motif but differs in its C-terminal extension. v-CARMEN and c-CARMEN interact directly in a CARD-dependent manner yet reveal different binding specificities toward members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family. v-CARMEN binds to TRAF6 and weakly to TRAF3 and, upon overexpression, potently induces the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcriptional pathways. c-CARMEN or truncated versions thereof do not appear to induce JNK and NF-kappaB activation by themselves, nor do they affect the JNK and NF-kappaB activating potential of v-CARMEN. Thus, in contrast to the cellular homologue, v-CARMEN may have additional properties in its unique C terminus that allow for an autonomous activator effect on NF-kappaB and JNK. Through activation of NF-kappaB, v-CARMEN may regulate the expression of the cellular and viral genes important for viral replication.	1999	05	03	J Biol Chem	Thome	M
10187815	10.1074/jbc.274.15.10287	mE10, a novel caspase recruitment domain-containing proapoptotic molecule.	Apoptotic signaling is mediated by homophilic interactions between conserved domains present in components of the death pathway. The death domain, death effector domain, and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) are examples of such interaction motifs. We have identified a novel mammalian CARD-containing adaptor molecule termed mE10 (mammalian E10). The N-terminal CARD of mE10 exhibits significant homology (47% identity and 64% similarity) to the CARD of a gene from Equine Herpesvirus type 2. The C-terminal region is unique. Overexpression of mE10 in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells induces apoptosis. Mutational analysis indicates that CARD-mediated mE10 oligomerization is essential for killing activity. The C terminus of mE10 bound to the zymogen form of caspase-9 and promoted its processing to the active dimeric species. Taken together, these data suggest a model where autoproteolytic activation of pro-caspase-9 is mediated by mE10-induced oligomerization.	1999	05	03	J Biol Chem	Yan	M
10364242	10.1074/jbc.274.25.17946	CLAP, a novel caspase recruitment domain-containing protein in the tumor necrosis factor receptor pathway, regulates NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis.	Molecules that regulate NF-kappaB activation play critical roles in apoptosis and inflammation. We describe the cloning of the cellular homolog of the equine herpesvirus-2 protein E10 and show that both proteins regulate apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation. These proteins were found to contain N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs) and novel C-terminal domains (CTDs) and were therefore named CLAPs (CARD-like apoptotic proteins). The cellular and viral CLAPs induce apoptosis downstream of caspase-8 by activating the Apaf-1-caspase-9 pathway and activate NF-kappaB by acting upstream of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, NIK, and the IkB kinase, IKKalpha. Deletion of either the CARD or the CTD domain inhibits both activities. The CARD domain was found to be important for homo- and heterodimerization of CLAPs. Substitution of the CARD domain with an inducible FKBP12 oligomerization domain produced a molecule that can induce NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that the CARD domain functions as an oligomerization domain, whereas the CTD domain functions as the effector domain in the NF-kappaB activation pathway. Expression of the CARD domain of human CLAP abrogates tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that cellular CLAP plays an essential role in this pathway of NF-kappaB activation.	1999	07	15	J Biol Chem	Srinivasula	S M
10400625	10.1074/jbc.274.29.20127	c-E10 is a caspase-recruiting domain-containing protein that interacts with components of death receptors signaling pathway and activates nuclear factor-kappaB.	Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily induce apoptosis via interaction with FADD and regulate cell growth and differentiation through TRADD and TRAFs molecules. While screening for molecules involved in the regulation of death receptor signaling, we identified a novel protein, c-E10. c-E10 contains an amino-terminal caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) and shares a sequence homologous with E10, a viral CARD-containing protein that binds to c-E10. In transfection experiments c-E10 oligomerizes, binds to the cytoplasmic portion of TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) and coprecipitates with TRADD. Expression of c-E10 under the control of a doxycycline-dependent transcriptional transactivator results in NF-kappaB activation, which is inhibited by dominant negative forms of TRAF2 and NIK kinase. Thus, our results suggest that c-E10 is an adapter protein that activates NF-kappaB through a molecular pathway involved in death receptor signaling.	1999	08	19	J Biol Chem	Costanzo	A
9989495	10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80957-5	Bcl10 is involved in t(1;14)(p22;q32) of MALT B cell lymphoma and mutated in multiple tumor types.	MALT B cell lymphomas with t(1;14)(p22;q32) showed a recurrent breakpoint upstream of the promoter of a novel gene, Bcl10. Bcl10 is a cellular homolog of the equine herpesvirus-2 E10 gene: both contain an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) homologous to that found in several apoptotic molecules. Bcl10 and E10 activated NF-kappaB but caused apoptosis of 293 cells. Bcl10 expressed in a MALT lymphoma exhibited a frameshift mutation resulting in truncation distal to the CARD. Truncated Bcl10 activated NF-kappaB but did not induce apoptosis. Wild-type Bcl10 suppressed transformation, whereas mutant forms had lost this activity and displayed gain-of-function transforming activity. Similar mutations were detected in other tumor types, indicating that Bcl10 may be commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human malignancy.	1999	03	16	Cell	Willis	T G
35143940	10.1016/j.gene.2022.146289	Reactivation of γ-globin expression using a minicircle DNA system to treat β-thalassemia.	Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin by editing the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) erythroid enhancer is an effective gene therapy for β-thalassemia. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, fetal γ-globin expression can be robustly reactivated to mitigate the clinical course of β-thalassemia. In our study, we found that the transfection efficiencies of CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) were significantly and negatively correlated with the length of plasmids and greatly affected by the linearization of plasmids. Furthermore, the transgene expression of minicircles (MC) without plasmid backbone sequences was better both in vitro and in vivo compared with conventional plasmids. Thus, MC DNA was used to deliver the cassette of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) into HSPCs, and a single-guide RNA targeting the erythroid enhancer region of BCL11A was selected. After electroporation with MC DNA, an evident efficiency of gene editing and reactivation of γ-globin expression in erythroblasts derived from unsorted HSPCs was acquired. No significant off-target effects were found by deep sequencing. Furthermore, fragments derived from lentiviral vectors, but not MC DNA, were highly enriched in promoter, exon, intron, distal-intergenic, and cancer-associated genes, indicating that MC DNA provided a relatively safe and efficient vector for delivering transgenes. The developed MC DNA vector provided a potential approach for the delivery of SaCas9 cassette and the reactivation of γ-globin expression for ameliorating syndromes of β-thalassemia.	2022	03	21	Gene	Ma	Shuang-Ping
35300055	10.2147/PGPM.S351599	Association Between Selected Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Globin and Related Genes and Response to Hydroxyurea Therapy in Ghanaian Children with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of genetic disorders affecting the structure and function of haemoglobin. Hydroxyurea (HU) stimulates fetal haemoglobin (HbF) and reduces sickle erythrocyte-endothelial cell interaction. However, the degree of HbF response to HU varies, with HbF expression-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quantitative trait loci (QTL) been implicated. We investigated the relationship between four SNPs (rs11886868, rs6706648, rs7606173 and 158C/T Xmn1) in two QTL (B-cell lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) and Xmn1) and HbF levels in children with SCD in Accra, Ghana. A total of 110 children with SCD in steady-state, comprising 64 and 46 SCD children treated with HU (HU+) or with no history of HU therapy (HU-), respectively, were recruited. HbF levels were measured in peripheral blood by alkali denaturation and SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The presence of SNPs (rs11886868, rs6706648, rs7606173 and -158C/T Xmn1) was identified. Observed heterozygosity and homozygosity for the derived alleles were 45.7%, 82.6%, 21.7% and 39.1% in rs11886868, rs6706648, rs7606173 and -158C/T Xmn1 polymorphisms, respectively, for the HU+ population. Observed frequencies of the minor alleles were 0.204, 0.477, 0.171 and 0.190 for rs11886868, rs6706648, rs7606173 and -158C/T Xmn1 polymorphisms, respectively. The three BCL11A SNPs in the HU+ population showed homozygous individuals for rs11886868 (CC), rs6706648 (CC) and heterozygous or homozygous mutant individuals for rs7606173 (CG/GG) having higher HbF values. The combined effect of the SNPs was associated with variance in HbF levels in the HU+ population. The BCL11A SNP, rs6706648 was strongly associated with HbF levels and the C allele frequency, with significantly elevated HbF levels. An association between the various variants and combined effect of SNPs and HbF among children with SCD was found and confirms the known association between HU intake and increased HbF in SCD.	2022	03	19	Pharmgenomics Pers Med	Manu	Gloria Pokuaa
35504960	10.1038/s41598-022-11247-z	A retrospective study on the clinicopathological and molecular features of 22 cases of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma in children and adolescents.	Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) in children and adolescents is a rare type of T/NK cell neoplasms. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinicopathological and genetic features of this rare entity of lymphoma. We evaluated the clinical, histopathological and molecular features of 22 young people with NKTCL, including 15 males and 7 females, with a median age of 15 years. The results revealed that the nasal site was the most involved region while non-nasal sites were observed in 27.3% out of all cases. The tumor cells were composed of small‑sized to large cells and 19 (86.4%) cases exhibited coagulative necrosis. The neoplastic cells in all patients were positive for CD3 and the cytotoxic markers. Nineteen (86.4%) cases were positive for CD56. Reduced expression of CD5 was observed in all available cases. CD30 was heterogeneously expressed in 15 (75.0%) cases. All 22 patients were EBV positive. Seven (36.8%) out of all the 19 patients during the follow-up died of the disease, and the median follow‑up period was 44 months. Moreover, patients treated with radiotherapy/chemotherapy showed significantly inferior OS compared with the untreated patients. High mutation frequencies were detected including KMT2C (5/5), MST1 (5/5), HLA-A (3/5) and BCL11A (3/5), which involved in modifications, tumor suppression and immune surveillance. These results suggest that NKTCL in children and adolescents exhibits histopathological and immunohistochemical features similar to the cases in adults. Active treatment is necessary after the diagnosis of NKTCL is confirmed. Furthermore, genetic analyse may provide a deep understanding of this rare disease.	2022	05	05	Sci Rep	Wang	Guan-Nan
35805190	10.3390/cells11132106	Selective Ablation of BCL11A in Epidermal Keratinocytes Alters Skin Homeostasis and Accelerates Excisional Wound Healing In Vivo.	Transcriptional regulator BCL11A plays a crucial role in coordinating a suite of developmental processes including skin morphogenesis, barrier functions and lipid metabolism. There is little or no reports so far documenting the role of BCL11A in postnatal adult skin homeostasis and in the physiological process of tissue repair and regeneration. The current study establishes for the first time the In Vivo role of epidermal BCL11A in maintaining adult epidermal homeostasis and as a negative regulator of cutaneous wound healing. Conditional ablation of <i>Bcl11a</i> in skin epidermal keratinocytes (<i>Bcl11a<sup>ep-/-</sup></i>mice) enhances the keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation program, suggesting its critical role in epidermal homeostasis of adult murine skin. Further, loss of keratinocytic BCL11A promotes rapid closure of excisional wounds both in a cell autonomous manner likely via accelerating wound re-epithelialization and in a non-cell autonomous manner by enhancing angiogenesis. The epidermis specific <i>Bcl11a</i> knockout mouse serves as a prototype to gain mechanistic understanding of various downstream pathways converging towards the manifestation of an accelerated healing phenotype upon its deletion.	2022	07	12	Cells	Bhattacharya	Nilika
35806029	10.3390/ijms23137025	LRF Promotes Indirectly Advantageous Chromatin Conformation via <i>BGLT3</i>-lncRNA Expression and Switch from Fetal to Adult Hemoglobin.	The hemoglobin switch from fetal (HbF) to adult (HbA) has been studied intensively as an essential model for gene expression regulation, but also as a beneficial therapeutic approach for β-hemoglobinopathies, towards the objective of reactivating HbF. The transcription factor LRF (Leukemia/lymphoma-related), encoded from the <i>ZBTB7A</i> gene has been implicated in fetal hemoglobin silencing, though has a wide range of functions that have not been fully clarified. We thus established the LRF/<i>ZBTB7A</i>-overexpressing and <i>ZBTB7A</i>-knockdown K562 (human erythroleukemia cell line) clones to assess fetal vs. adult hemoglobin production pre- and post-induction. Transgenic K562 clones were further developed and studied under the influence of epigenetic chromatin regulators, such as DNA methyl transferase 3 (DNMT3) and Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), to evaluate LRF's potential disturbance upon the aberrant epigenetic background and provide valuable information of the preferable epigenetic frame, in which LRF unfolds its action on the β-type globin's expression. The ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that LRF binds to γ-globin genes (<i>HBG2/1</i>) and apparently associates BCL11A for their silencing, but also during erythropoiesis induction, LRF binds the <i>BGLT3</i> gene, promoting <i>BGLT3</i>-lncRNA production through the γ-δ intergenic region of β-type globin's locus, triggering the transcriptional events from γ- to β-globin switch. Our findings are supported by an up-to-date looping model, which highlights chromatin alterations during erythropoiesis at late stages of gestation, to establish an ""open"" chromatin conformation across the γ-δ intergenic region and accomplish β-globin expression and hemoglobin switch.	2022	07	12	Int J Mol Sci	Chondrou	Vasiliki

To access the value of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) in the prognosis of patients with neuroblastoma (NB), and to explore its role and possible mechanism in NB. Tumor specimens from 53 children with neuroblastoma were evaluated for the relationship between BCL11A expression level and prognosis of NB patients. Online datasets like SEQC and Asgharzadeh were analyzed to further check out the suppose.The role of BCL11A in the proliferation and migration of NB cells was studied by functional experiments such as CCK8, colony formation, flow cytometry,transwell and wound healing assay, after knocking down BCL11A by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in vitro. The protein makers of the potential pathways were tested by western blot. High expression of BCL11A in NB patients was closely correlated with high-risk and poor prognosis. The proliferation and migration abilities of NB cell lines SK-N-BE(2) and IMR-32 were significantly impaired by silencing BCL11A. Downregulation of BCL11A expression level in NB cells inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and affected the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. As a prognostic indicator of survival in NB patients, BCL11A might serve as a potential therapeutic target. BCL11A played a regulatory role in cell proliferation, invasion and migration in NB,which may be through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induce EMT.	2022	08	01	Curr Cancer Drug Targets	Jin	Qianya
32882024	10.1093/jnci/djaa133	Genome-Wide Association Study of Susceptibility Loci for TCF3-PBX1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. TCF3-PBX1 fusion defines a common molecular subtype of ALL with unique clinical features, but the molecular basis of its inherited susceptibility is unknown. In a genome-wide association study of 1494 ALL cases and 2057 non-ALL controls, we identified a germline risk locus located in an intergenic region between BCL11A and PAPOLG: rs2665658, P = 1.88 × 10-8 for TCF3-PBX1 ALL vs non-ALL, and P = 1.70 × 10-8 for TCF3-PBX1 ALL vs other-ALL. The lead variant was validated in a replication cohort, and conditional analyses pointed to a single causal variant with subtype-specific effect. The risk variant is located in a regulatory DNA element uniquely activated in ALL cells with the TCF3-PBX1 fusion and may distally modulate the transcription of the adjacent gene REL. Our results expand the understanding of subtype-specific ALL susceptibility and highlight plausible interplay between germline variants and somatic genomic abnormalities in ALL pathogenesis.	2022	02	24	J Natl Cancer Inst	Lee	Shawn H R
33910976	10.1126/scitranslmed.abb0411	Sustained fetal hemoglobin induction in vivo is achieved by <i>BCL11A</i> interference and coexpressed truncated erythropoietin receptor.	Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease, requires high-efficiency lentiviral gene transfer and robust therapeutic globin expression in erythroid cells. Erythropoietin is a key cytokine for erythroid proliferation and differentiation (erythropoiesis), and truncated human erythropoietin receptors (thEpoR) have been reported in familial polycythemia. We reasoned that coexpression of thEpoR could enhance the phenotypic effect of a therapeutic vector in erythroid cells in xenograft mouse and autologous nonhuman primate transplantation models. We generated thEpoR by deleting 40 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, allowing for erythropoietin-dependent enhanced erythropoiesis of gene-modified cells. We then designed lentiviral vectors encoding both thEpoR and B cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (<i>BCL11A</i>)-targeting microRNA-adapted short hairpin RNA (shmiR BCL11A) driven by an erythroid-specific promoter. thEpoR expression enhanced erythropoiesis among gene-modified cells in vitro. We then transplanted lentiviral vector gene-modified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with erythroid-specific expression of both thEpoR and shmiR BCL11A and compared to cells modified with shmiR BCL11A only. We found that thEpoR enhanced shmiR BCL11A-based fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in both xenograft mice and rhesus macaques, whereas HbF induction with shmiR BCL11A only was robust, yet transient. thEpoR/shmiR BCL11A coexpression allowed for sustained HbF induction at 20 to 25% in rhesus macaques for 4 to 8 months. In summary, we developed erythroid-specific thEpoR/shmiR BCL11A-expressing vectors, enhancing HbF induction in xenograft mice and rhesus macaques. The sustained HbF induction achieved by addition of thEpoR and shmiR BCL11A may represent a viable gene therapy strategy for hemoglobin disorders.	2021	07	12	Sci Transl Med	Uchida	Naoya
33959502	10.3389/fonc.2021.638897	c-Rel Is the Pivotal NF-κB Subunit in Germinal Center Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A LYSA Study.	Relationships between c-Rel and GCB-DLBCLs remain unclear. We found that strong c-Rel DNA-binding activity was mostly found in GCBs on two independent series of 48 DLBCLs and 66 DLBCLs, the latter issued from the GHEDI series. c-Rel DNA-binding activity was associated with increased <i>REL</i> mRNA expression. Extending the study to the whole GHEDI and Lenz DLBCL published series of 202 and 233 cases, it was found that the c-Rel gene expression profile (GEP) overlapped partially (12%) but only with the GCB GEP and not with the GEP of ABC-DLBCLs. Cases with both overexpression of <i>REL</i> mRNA and c-Rel GEP were defined as those having a c-Rel signature. These cases were GCBs in 88 and 83% of the GHEDI or Lenz's DLBCL series respectively. The c-Rel signature was also associated with various recurrent GCB-DLBCL genetic events, including <i>REL</i> gains, <i>BCL2</i> translocation, <i>MEF2B</i>, <i>EZH2</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, and <i>TNFRSF14</i> mutations and with the EZB GCB genetic subtype. By CGH array, the c-Rel signature was specifically correlated with 2p15-16.1 amplification that includes XPO1, BCL11A, and USP34 and with the 22q11.22 deletion that covers IGLL5 and PRAME. The total number of gene copy number aberrations, so-called genomic imbalance complexity, was decreased in cases with the c-Rel signature. These cases exhibited a better overall survival. Functionally, overexpression of c-Rel induced its constitutive nuclear localization and protected cells against apoptosis while its repression tended to increase cell death. These results show that, clinically and biologically, c-Rel is the pivotal NF-<i>κ</i>B subunit in the GCB-DLBCL subgroup. Functionally, c-Rel overexpression could directly promote DLBCL tumorigenesis without need for further activation signals.	2021	05	08	Front Oncol	Faumont	Nathalie
34592153	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109759	Structural basis for human ZBTB7A action at the fetal globin promoter.	Elevated levels of fetal globin protect against β-hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. Two zinc-finger (ZF) repressors, BCL11A and ZBTB7A/LRF, bind directly to the fetal globin promoter elements positioned at -115 and -200, respectively. Here, we describe X-ray structures of the ZBTB7A DNA-binding domain, consisting of four adjacent ZFs, in complex with the -200 sequence element, which contains two copies of four consecutive C:G base pairs. ZF1 and ZF2 recognize the 5' C:G quadruple, and ZF4 contacts the 3' C:G quadruple. Natural non-coding DNA mutations associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) impair ZBTB7A DNA binding, with the most severe disruptions resulting from mutations in the base pairs recognized by ZF1 and ZF2. Our results firmly establish ZBTB7A/LRF as a key molecular regulator of fetal globin expression and inform genome-editing strategies that inhibit repressor binding and boost fetal globin expression to treat hemoglobinopathies.	2022	02	10	Cell Rep	Yang	Yang
34611409	10.2147/OTT.S319845	Identification of a Novel SLC8A1-ALK Fusion and Non-Canonical Expression Significantly Responding to ALK-TKIs in Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report.	Approximately 2-7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement events. Of note, typical ALK actionable rearrangements are sensitive to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, different types of ALK fusion influence the clinical outcomes of this therapeutic approach. Approximately 10-40% of patients with ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer do not response to ALK-TKI therapy. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify the types of ALK rearrangement for appropriate selection of clinical treatment. Using a DNA-targeted next-generation sequencing technique, we found a novel solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1)-ALK fusion type in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma. Further reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing demonstrated the rearrangement as a B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A)-ALK fusion at the transcriptional level. The patient showed a rapid and strong response to treatment with crizotinib, which lasted for 9 months. The patient also responded well to treatment with alectinib after developed resistance to crizotinib. A strategy combining DNA-targeted next-generation sequencing with RNA reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, besides fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, may provide an effective and practical solution for correct identification of partner genes and fusion structures in the diagnosis of ALK rearrangements, particularly for non-canonical expression patterns of ALK fusion events. The combined approach may lead to more benefits for patients.	2022	04	27	Onco Targets Ther	Zhu	Xingyu
30853596	10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.03.002	Identification of deleterious SNPs and their effects on BCL11A, the master regulator of fetal hemoglobin expression.	The B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A protein (encoded by BCL11A gene) is a key regulator of fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switching as seen in post-natal life. Although genetic polymorphisms like SNPs in BCL11A gene are expected to affect fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression levels, yet their implications are poorly studied. This study utilizes a computational approach to identify the deleterious SNPs which may affect the structure and function of BCL11A protein. The study also generated a 3D structure of native and mutants. The analysis identified two SNPs in BCL11A as highly deleterious: N391K and C414S which are expected to affect structure and stability of the protein. According to conservation analysis, both residues N391 and C414 were identified as highly conserved. Additionally, post-translational modification sites were predicted at both sites. Ligand binding sites were also predicted in N391 and C414. Therefore, N391K and C414S in BCL11A can considered as important candidates to mediate HbF variation.	2020	08	12	Genomics	Das	Sankha Subhra
32013807	10.1177/1010428319901061	Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of <i>Inula viscosa</i> extract on Burkitt lymphoma cell line.	Burkitt lymphoma is a very aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although remarkable progress has been made in the therapeutic scenario for patients with Burkitt lymphoma, search and development of new effective anticancer agents to improve patient outcome and minimize toxicity has become an urgent issue. In this study, the antitumoral activity of <i>Inula viscosa</i>, a traditional herb obtained from plants collected on the Asinara Island, Italy, was evaluated in order to explore potential antineoplastic effects of its metabolites on Burkitt lymphoma. Raji human cell line was treated with increasing <i>Inula viscosa</i> extract concentration for cytotoxicity screening and subsequent establishment of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, gene expression profiles were performed to identify molecular mechanisms involved in the anticancer activities of this medical plant. The <i>Inula viscosa</i> extract exhibited powerful antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities on Raji cell line, showing a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, obtained by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and an increase in cell apoptosis. The treatment with <i>Inula viscosa</i> caused downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation (c-MYC, CCND1) and inhibition of cell apoptosis (BCL2, BCL2L1, BCL11A). The <i>Inula viscosa</i> extract causes strong anticancer effects on Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The molecular mechanisms underlying such antineoplastic activity are based on targeting and downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis. Our data suggest that <i>Inula viscosa</i> natural metabolites should be further exploited as potential antineoplastic agents against Burkitt lymphoma.	2020	02	18	Tumour Biol	Virdis	Patrizia
32085444	10.3390/ani10020317	Metabolic and Biomolecular Changes Induced by Incremental Long-Term Training in Young Thoroughbred Racehorses during First Workout Season.	Training has a huge effect on physiological homeostasis. The Thoroughbred racehorse is a valid animal model to investigate such changes for training schedule fine-tuning. As happens in human athletes, it is hypothesized that biochemical and immune response changes and related biomolecular variations could be induced by training programs. The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the long-term metabolic and biomolecular modifications in young untrained Thoroughbred racehorses in the first 4-month timeframe training period. Twenty-nine clinically healthy, untrained, two-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses were followed during their incremental 4-month sprint exercise schedule. Blood collection was performed once a month, five times (T-30, T0, T30, T60, and T90). For each sample, lactate concentration, plasma cell volume (PCV), and hematobiochemical parameters (glucose, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (Tbil), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin (Alb), total proteins (TPs), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium (K<sup>-</sup>), and chloride (Cl)) were determined. At T-30 and T90, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), serum amyloid A (SAA), and real-time qPCR were performed on all samples to evaluate the expression of key genes and cytokines related to inflammatory and Th2 immunity responses: Interleukin-4 (<i>IL-4</i>), Interleukin-6 (<i>IL-6</i>), Interleukin-10 (<i>IL-10</i>), Interleukin-1β (<i>IL-1β</i>), Octamer-Binding Transcription Factor 1 (<i>OCT1</i>), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (<i>BCL11A</i>). Statistical analysis was performed (ANOVA and <i>t</i> test, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Significant modifications were identified compared with T-30 for PCV, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, lactate, urea, creatinine, Tbil, ALP, LDH, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SAA, TPs, SPE, <i>IL</i>-<i>6, IL</i>-<i>4</i>, <i>Oct-1</i>, and BCL<i>11A</i>.

32218847	10.3892/ol.2020.11383	BCL11A confers cell invasion and migration in androgen receptor-positive triple-negative breast cancer.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor clinical prognosis due to a lack of effective therapeutic options. The expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) has been indicated to correlate with TNBC carcinogenesis, though the precise mechanisms of BCL11A-induced tumorigenesis in TNBC remain unclear. Using data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the present study demonstrated that BCL11A expression was upregulated in TNBC, compared with other types of breast cancer. Furthermore, in a tissue microarray of 140 patients with breast cancer, an elevated BCL11A level was correlated with unfavorable overall survival (OS), and exogenous BCL11A-knockdown was subsequently verified to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC. Notably, the same tissue microarray revealed that a favorable patient outcome was associated with high expression levels of BCL11A and androgen receptor (AR). Moreover, BCL11A-knockdown significantly inhibited the expression level of AR and further had an influence on proliferation, migration and invasion in TNBC cell lines. Collectively, the results of the current study indicate the function of BCL11A in TNBC progression, and provide new insights into the unique mechanism of BCL11A in AR regulation, emphasizing the significance of more research on BCL11A and AR regulation in TNBC molecular treatment.	2020	09	28	Oncol Lett	Wang	Xin

We investigated the consequences of overexpressing BCL11A in the LSCC cell line on proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, chemosensitivity, and growth <i>in vivo</i>. We explored the relationship between BCL11A and MDM2 in LSCC and tumorigenesis pathways by using the Human Cancer PathwayFinder Array. <b>Results:</b> High levels of BCL11A were found in LSCC tissues and were more frequently associated with advanced lymphatic metastasis stages with poor prognoses. BCL11A overexpression enhanced LSCC proliferation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>vivo</i>. A positive correlation between MDM2 and BCL11A expression was identified. <b>Conclusions:</b> These data uncover important functions of BCL11A in LSCC and identify BCL11A as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in LSCC.	2020	09	28	Front Oncol	Zhou	Jian
32319565	10.3892/ijo.2020.4995	miR‑574‑5p attenuates proliferation, migration and EMT in triple‑negative breast cancer cells by targeting BCL11A and SOX2 to inhibit the SKIL/TAZ/CTGF axis.	Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a high degree of malignancy. TNBC is prone to distant metastasis and has a poor prognosis. A number of TNBC‑related microRNAs (miRNAs) have been studied and identified. However, the detailed roles of miR‑574‑5p in TNBC remain poorly understood. miR‑574‑5p, SRY (sex determining region Y)‑box 2 (SOX2), B‑cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A), SKI like proto‑oncogene (SKIL) and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related miRNAs and proteins were measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting analysis, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the direct targeting of SOX2 and BCL11A by miR‑574‑5p. MTT, colony formation and Transwell assays were performed to analyse the biological functions of miR‑574‑5p in TNBC cells. A nude mouse xenograft model was used to verify the effects of miR‑574‑5p on the tumorigenesis of TNBC in vivo. The results demonstrated that miR‑574‑5p levels were decreased in breast cancer tissues and cells. miR‑574‑5p repressed proliferation, migration and EMT in TNBC cells. Further experiments confirmed that miR‑574‑5p reduced tumour size and metastasis in vivo. miR‑574‑5p targeted BCL11A and SOX2 to inhibit the SKIL/transcriptional co‑activator with PDZ‑binding motif/connective tissue growth factor axis, and the inhibitory effect of miR‑574‑5p in TNBC cells was at least partly dependent on SOX2 and BCL11A. In addition, the regulation of downstream oncogenes by SOX2 was dependent on BCL11A. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the association between the miR‑574‑5p/BCL11A/SOX2 axis and the tumorigenesis of TNBC, which provides a new mechanism for understanding the progression of TNBC.	2021	02	08	Int J Oncol	Zhang	Ke-Jing
32576660	10.1074/jbc.RA120.014018	The transcriptional repressor BCL11A promotes breast cancer metastasis.	The phenotypes of each breast cancer subtype are defined by their transcriptomes. However, the transcription factors that regulate differential patterns of gene expression that contribute to specific disease outcomes are not well understood. Here, using gene silencing and overexpression approaches, RNA-Seq, and splicing analysis, we report that the transcription factor B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and drives metastatic disease. Moreover, BCL11A promotes cancer cell invasion by suppressing the expression of muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 (<i>MBNL1</i>), a splicing regulator that suppresses metastasis. This ultimately increases the levels of an alternatively spliced isoform of integrin-α6 (<i>ITGA6</i>), which is associated with worse patient outcomes. These results suggest that BCL11A sustains TNBC cell invasion and metastatic growth by repressing MBNL1-directed splicing of <i>ITGA6</i> Our findings also indicate that BCL11A lies at the interface of transcription and splicing and promotes aggressive TNBC phenotypes.	2021	01	22	J Biol Chem	Seachrist	Darcie D
32625084	10.3389/fphar.2020.00820	BCL11A Is Oncogenic and Predicts Poor Outcomes in Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma.	The current treatment for natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) among advanced/relapsed patients is unsatisfying, thereby highlighting the need for novel therapeutic targets. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11 A (BCL11A), as a transcription factor, is oncogenic in several neoplasms. However, its function in NKTL remains unclear. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to measure the BCL11A expression levels among NKTL patients and in NKTL cell lines. Natural killer (NK) cells from healthy subjects were used as negative control. Transient transfection with small interfering RNA was used to knockdown the expression in NKTL cell lines. Samples and clinical histories were collected from 343 NKTL patients (divided into test and validation groups) to evaluate the clinical value of BCL11A expression level. The BCL11A expression was upregu\lated among NKTL patients and in NKTL cell lines. Reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis were observed after silencing BCL11A in NKTL cell lines. BCL11A expression level was correlated with RUNX3, c-MYC, and P53 in NKTL. Notably, a high BCL11A expression was correlated with unfavorable clinical characteristics and predicted poor outcomes in NKTL. In conclusion, BCL11A was overexpressed in NKTL, while its upregulation promoted tumor development. Therefore, BCL11A expression level may be a promising prognostic biomarker for NKTL.	2020	09	28	Front Pharmacol	Shi	Hongyun
32878504	10.1080/03630269.2020.1811117	Association Between Genetic Polymorphisms and Hb F Levels in Heterozygous β-Thalassemia 3.5 kb Deletions.	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genetic modifying factors have been related to Hb F levels, including <sup>G</sup>γ <i>Xmn</i>I polymorphism, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11 A (BCL11A), HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism (HMIP) and a mutation in the Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1). This study aimed to determine whether genetic variability of these modifying factors affects Hb F levels in heterozygous β-thalassemia (β-thal) 3.5 kb deletion (NC_000011.10: g.5224302-5227791del13490bp). A total of 111 β-thal 3.5 kb deletion carriers with Hb F levels ranging from 0.9 to 18.4% was recruited for this study. Genotyping of SNPs including <i>HBG2</i> rs7482144, HMIP rs4895441 and rs9399137, BCL11A rs4671393 and KLF1 rs2072596 was identified. Multiple regression analyses showed that only two SNPs (HMIP rs4895441 and rs9399137) influenced Hb F levels. Interestingly, a combination of these two SNPs was associated with higher Hb F levels. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the rs4895441, rs9399137 of HMIP are associated with elevated Hb F levels in the heterozygous β-thal 3.5 kb deletion.	2021	07	12	Hemoglobin	Tepakhan	Wanicha
32903878	10.1159/000508566	A Novel de novo Frameshift Mutation in the <i>BCL11A</i> Gene in a Patient with Intellectual Disability Syndrome and Epilepsy.	Intellectual disability syndrome (IDS) associated with a hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), also known as Dias-Logan syndrome, is commonly characterised by psychomotor developmental delay, intelectual disability, language delay, strabismus, thin upper lip, abnormalities of external ears, microcephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures. Sporadically, autism spectrum disorders and blue sclerae in infancy have been reported in IDS. Rarely, IDS-affected patients present with epilepsy and/or epileptic syndromes. It has been shown that a haploinsufficiency of the B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 11A gene (<i>BCL11A</i>) is responsible for IDS. Herein, we identified a novel de novo frameshift deletion (c.271delG; p.E91Afs*2) in the <i>BCL11A</i> gene in a boy affected with IDS. Interestingly, this heterozygous loss-of-function <i>BCL11A</i> mutation was also associated with a generalised idiopathic epilepsy and severe language delay observed in the patient. Moreover, our study showed that the combination of molecular genetic analyses with the monitoring of HbF was essential to make the final diagnosis of Dias-Logan syndrome. Because our patient suffered from well-controlled epilepsy, we propose to include the <i>BCL11A</i> gene in routinely used molecular genetic epilepsy-related gene panels. Additionally, many of the clinical features of IDS overlap with symptoms observed in patients with suspected alcohol spectrum disorders. Therefore, we also suggest monitoring HbF levels in patients with these syndromes to further facilitate clinical diagnosis.	2021	07	02	Mol Syndromol	Korenke	Georg Christoph
33073380	10.1111/bjh.17102	F cell numbers are associated with an X-linked genetic polymorphism and correlate with haematological parameters in patients with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) with high fetal haemoglobin (HbF) tend to have a lower incidence of complications and longer survival due to inhibition of deoxyhaemoglobin S (HbS) polymerisation by HbF. HbF-containing cells, namely F cells, are strongly influenced by genetic factors. We measured the percentage of F cells (Fcells%) in 222 patients with SCD to evaluate the association of (i) Fcells% with genetic HbF-modifier variants and (ii) Fcells% with haematological parameters. There was a different distribution of Fcells% in females compared to males. The association of the B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) locus with Fcells% (β = 8·238; P &lt; 0·001) and with HbF% (β = 2·490; P &lt; 0·001) was significant. All red cell parameters except for Hb and mean corpuscular Hb concentration levels in males and females were significantly different. The Fcells% was positively associated with mean cell Hb, mean cell volume and reticulocytes. To explain the significant gender difference in Fcells%, we tested for associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms on the X chromosomal region Xp22.2, where a genetic determinant of HbF had been previously hypothesised. We found in males a significant association with a SNP in FERM and PDZ domain-containing protein 4 (FRMPD4) and adjacent to male-specific lethal complex subunit 3 (MSL3). Thus, we have identified an X-linked locus that could account for a significant fraction of the Fcells% variation in patients with SCD.	2021	03	23	Br J Haematol	Urio	Florence
33154494	10.1038/s41598-020-76157-4	The bone marrow microenvironment of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia at single-cell resolution.	The bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) plays a key role in leukemia progression, but its molecular complexity in pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the most common cancer in children, remains poorly understood. To gain further insight, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the kinetics of the murine BMM during B-ALL progression. Normal pro- and pre-B cells were found to be the most affected at the earliest stages of disease and this was associated with changes in expression of genes regulated by the AP1-transcription factor complex and regulatory factors NELFE, MYC and BCL11A. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors show reduced expression of the tumor suppressor long non-coding RNA Neat1 and disruptions in the rate of transcription. Intercellular communication networks revealed monocyte-dendritic precursors to be consistently active during B-ALL progression, with enriched processes including cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, neutrophil-mediated immunity and regulation of cell migration and proliferation. In addition, we confirmed that the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment was perturbed during leukemogenesis. These findings extend our understanding of the complexity of changes and molecular interactions among the normal cells of the BMM during B-ALL progression.	2021	03	08	Sci Rep	Anderson	Denise
30124006	10.22074/cellj.2019.5589	Synergistic Effect of Simvastatin and Romidepsin on Gamma-globin Gene Induction.	Hemoglobinopathies such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are inherited disorders that are caused by mutations in beta-globin chain. Gamma-globin gene reactivation can ameliorate clinical manifestations of betathalassemia and SCD. Drugs that induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can be promising tools for treatment of beta-thalassemia and SCD patients. Recently, it has been shown that Simvastatin (SIM) and Romidepsin (ROM) induce HbF. SIM is a BCL11a inhibitor and ROM is a HDAC inhibitor and both of these drugs are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for hypercholesterolemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma respectively. Our aim was to evaluate the synergistic effects of these drugs in inducing HbF. In our experimental study, we isolated CD34+ cells from five cord blood samples that were cultured in erythroid differentiation medium containing ROM and Simvastatin. Then Gamma-globin, BCL11a and HDAC gene expression were evaluated on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day of erythroid differentiation by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunocytochemistry. Our results showed that combination of SIM and ROM significantly increased Gamma-globin gene expression and inhibit BCL11a and HDAC expression compared to results of using each of them alone. SIM and ROM lead to 3.09- fold increase in HbF production compared to the control group. Also, SIM inhibited BCL11a expression (0.065-fold) and ROM inhibited HDAC1 expression (0.47-fold) as two important inhibitors of HbF production after birth. We propose combination therapy of these drugs may be ameliorate clinical manifestation in beta-thalassemia and SCD with at least side effects and reduce the need for blood transfusion.	2022	03	18	Cell J	Habibi	Hussain
30520249	10.1111/1753-0407.12882	Role of metabolic syndrome and its components as mediators of the genetic effect on type 2 diabetes: A family-based study in China.	Metabolic syndrome (MetS) share a genetic basis with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether MetS and its components mediate genetic susceptibility to T2D is not completely understood. We assessed the effects of MetS and its components on associations T2D and 18 genome-wide association studies-identified variants using a two-stage strategy based on parametric models involving 7110 Chinese participants (2436 were T2D patients) across 2885 families. Multilevel logistic regression was used to account for the intrafamilial correlation. Metabolic syndrome significantly mediated the effect of a melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) polymorphism on T2D risk (OR of average causal mediation effect [OR<sub>ACME</sub> ] 1.004; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-1.008; P = 0.018). In addition, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels mediated the genetic effects of MTNR1B (OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.012; 95% CI 1.007-1.015; P &lt; 0.001), solute carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8; OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.001; 95% CI 1.000-1.007; P &lt; 0.040), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A; OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.009; 95% CI 1.007-1.016; P &lt; 0.001), prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1; OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.005; 95% CI 1.003-1.011; P &lt; 0.001) and a disintegrin and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9 (ADAMTS9; OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.006; 95% CI 1.001-1.009; P = 0.022), whereas increased fasting blood glucose (FBG) significantly mediated the genetic effect of BCL11A (OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.017; 95% CI 1.003-1.021; P = 0.012). This study provides evidence that MetS and two of its components (HDL-C, FBG) may be involved in mediating the genetic predisposition to T2D, which emphasize the importance of maintaining normal HDL-C and FBG levels. 背景: 代谢综合征与2型糖尿病在某些遗传背景方面具有相似性，但代谢综合征及其组分是否参与调节2型糖尿病的遗传易感性目前尚不完全清楚。 方法: 本研究对代谢综合征及其组分在18个全基因组关联研究提示阳性基因位点与2型糖尿病的关联中所起的作用进行了两阶段基于参数模型的分析。研究共纳入7110名中国人群研究对象(其中2436名为2型糖尿病患者)，分布在2885个家系中。研究采用多水平logistic回归模型对家系成员间的相关性进行调整。 结果: 本研究发现代谢综合征在MTNR1B基因位点与2型糖尿病风险的关联中具有显著的调节作用(平均因果介导效应OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.004；95% CI:1.001-1.008；P = 0.018)。另外，低水平的高密度脂蛋白胆固醇在MTNR1B基因位点(OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.012；95% CI 1.007-1.015；P &lt; 0.001)、SLC30A8基因位点(OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.001；95% CI 1.000-1.007；P &lt; 0.040)、BCL11A基因位点(OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.009；95% CI 1.007-1.016；P &lt; 0.001)、PROX1基因位点(OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.005；95% CI 1.003-1.011；P &lt; 0.001)以及ADAMTS9基因位点(OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.006；95% CI 1.001-1.009；P = 0.022)与2型糖尿病风险关联中具有统计学介导效应。而空腹血糖增加可能参与调节BCL11A基因位点对2型糖尿病风险的遗传效应(OR<sub>ACME</sub> 1.017；1.003-1.021；P = 0.012)。 结论: 本研究为代谢综合征及其两个组分(高密度脂蛋白胆固醇和空腹血糖水平)可能参与介导2型糖尿病的遗传易感性提供了证据，提示高密度脂蛋白胆固醇水平和空腹血糖水平的控制对于2型糖尿病遗传易感人群的疾病预防具有重要意义。.	2019	12	13	J Diabetes	Song	Jing
30768627	10.1371/journal.pone.0212492	The rs61742690 (S783N) single nucleotide polymorphism is a suitable target for disrupting BCL11A-mediated foetal-to-adult globin switching.	B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) is a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor protein that is a critical modulator of haemoglobin switching and suppresses the production of foetal haemoglobin. Variation in the BCL11A gene ameliorates the severity of sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia (β-thal). The BCL11A gene is located on chromosome 2p16.1 and encodes an 835-amino acid protein. Using state-of-the-art in silico tools, this study examined the most pathogenic non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) that disrupt the BCL11A protein and mediate foetal-to-adult globin switching. A total of 11,463 SNPs were retrieved from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP). These included 799 in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), 486 in the 3' UTR, and 266 non-synonymous, 189 coding synonymous, six nonsense, and six stop-gained SNPs. In silico tools (SIFT, SNAP, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, I-Mutant, PROVEAN, SNPs&amp;GO, mCSM, and PhD-SNP) predicted the five most-deleterious nsSNPs: rs61742690, rs62142605, rs17028351, rs115666026, and rs74987258. Molecular dynamic simulation and homology modelling of the mutated proteins (S783N, D643N, G451S, K670R, and M313L) of the most deleterious nsSNPs revealed their functional and structural impact. nsSNP rs61742690 was predicted to be the most deleterious, as supported by eight of the nine in silico tools. Complete failure in the protein-protein interactions with functional partners (KLF1 and others) and significant changes (±100% variation) in the interface energy revealed that rs61742690 (S783N) in the zinc-finger domain is a suitable target for disrupting BCL11A-mediated foetal-to-adult globin switching.	2019	11	18	PLoS One	Abdulazeez	Sayed
30870006	10.1096/fj.201802252R	Long noncoding RNA CDKN2B-AS1 interacts with transcription factor BCL11A to regulate progression of cerebral infarction through mediating MAP4K1 transcription.	The effective therapeutic approach of cerebral infarction is limited because of its underlying complexity. Recently, multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction. Here, the current study aims to explore the interaction among lncRNA cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2B-antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1), transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A), and MAPKK kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) and further investigate whether they affect cerebral infarction progression. The expression of CDKN2B-AS1, BCL11A, and MAP4K1 was altered in lymphocytes extracted from patients with cerebral infarction. In order to identify their roles in regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, the proliferation and apoptosis of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells were examined, and levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β were determined. Also, the RNA crosstalk among CDKN2B-AS1, BCL11A, and MAP4K1 was validated. Finally, we established a rat model of middle cerebral arterial occlusion to evaluate the neurologic impairment and cerebral infarction volume. The results revealed that lymphocytes in patients with cerebral infarction presented with the up-regulated expression of CDKN2B-AS1. Moreover, BCL11A could specifically bind to CDKN2B-AS1 and MAP4K1 promoter so as to inhibit MAP4K1. Moreover, it was observed that down-regulated CDKN2B-AS1 inhibited CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub>-cell proliferation, reduced levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β and cerebral infarction volume, and elevated MAP4K1 expression. Collectively, our study provides evidence that CDKN2B-AS1 silencing could increase MAP4K1 expression to inhibit the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub>-cell proliferation by reducing enrichment of transcription factor BCL11A, thereby protecting against cerebral infarction progression, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy for treating cerebral infarction.-Lei, J.-J., Li, H.-Q., Mo, Z.-H., Liu, K.-J., Zhu, L.-J., Li, C.-Y., Chen, W.-L., Zhang, L.

31000522	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3438	MDM4 Is Targeted by 1q Gain and Drives Disease in Burkitt Lymphoma.	Oncogenic MYC activation promotes proliferation in Burkitt lymphoma, but also induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis mediated by p53, a tumor suppressor that is mutated in 40% of Burkitt lymphoma cases. To identify molecular dependencies in Burkitt lymphoma, we performed RNAi-based, loss-of-function screening in eight Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and integrated non-Burkitt lymphoma RNAi screens and genetic data. We identified 76 genes essential to Burkitt lymphoma, including genes associated with hematopoietic cell differentiation (<i>FLI1, BCL11A</i>) or B-cell development and activation (<i>PAX5, CDKN1B, JAK2, CARD11</i>) and found a number of context-specific dependencies including oncogene addiction in cell lines with <i>TCF3</i>/<i>ID3</i> or <i>MYD88</i> mutation. The strongest genotype-phenotype association was seen for <i>TP53</i>. MDM4, a negative regulator of <i>TP53</i>, was essential in <i>TP53</i> wild-type (TP53wt) Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. <i>MDM4</i> knockdown activated p53, induced cell-cycle arrest, and decreased tumor growth in a xenograft model in a p53-dependent manner. Small molecule inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction was effective only in TP53wt Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Moreover, primary TP53wt Burkitt lymphoma samples frequently acquired gains of chromosome 1q, which includes the <i>MDM4</i> locus, and showed elevated MDM4 mRNA levels. 1q gain was associated with TP53wt across 789 cancer cell lines and <i>MDM4</i> was essential in the TP53wt-context in 216 cell lines representing 19 cancer entities from the Achilles Project. Our findings highlight the critical role of p53 as a tumor suppressor in Burkitt lymphoma and identify MDM4 as a functional target of 1q gain in a wide range of cancers that is therapeutically targetable. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting MDM4 to alleviate degradation of p53 can be exploited therapeutically across Burkitt lymphoma and other cancers with wild-type p53 harboring 1q gain, the most frequent copy number alteration in cancer.	2020	03	11	Cancer Res	Hüllein	Jennifer
31039344	10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.04.042	Targeted deletion of BCL11A gene by CRISPR-Cas9 system for fetal hemoglobin reactivation: A promising approach for gene therapy of beta thalassemia disease.	Hemoglobinopathies, such as β-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease (SCD) are caused by abnormal structure or reduced production of β-chains and affect millions of people worldwide. Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is a condition which is naturally occurring and characterized by a considerable elevation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in adult red blood cells. Individuals with compound heterozygous β-thalassemia or SCD and HPFH have milder clinical symptoms. So, HbF reactivation has long been sought as an approach to mitigate the clinical symptoms of β-thalassemia and SCD. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing strategy, we deleted a 200bp genomic region within the human erythroid-specific BCL11A (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A) enhancer in KU-812, KG-1, and K562 cell lines. In our study, deletion of 200bp of BCL11A erythroid enhancer including GATAA motif leads to strong induction of γ-hemoglobin expression in K562 cells, but not in KU-812 and KG-1 cells. Altogether, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 as a precision genome editing tool for treating β-thalassemia. In addition, our data indicate that KU-812 and KG-1 cell lines are not good models for studying HbF reactivation through inactivation of BCL11A silencing pathway.	2019	11	11	Eur J Pharmacol	Khosravi	Mohammad Ali
31277480	10.3390/cancers11070941	The Unsolved Puzzle of c-Rel in B Cell Lymphoma.	Aberrant constitutive activation of Rel/NF-κB transcription factors is a hallmark of numerous cancers. Of the five Rel family members, c-Rel has the strongest direct links to tumorigenesis. c-Rel is the only member that can malignantly transform lymphoid cells in vitro. Furthermore, c-Rel is implicated in human B cell lymphoma through the frequent occurrence of <i>REL</i> gene locus gains and amplifications. In normal physiology, high c-Rel expression predominates in the hematopoietic lineage and a diverse range of stimuli can trigger enhanced expression and activation of c-Rel. Both expression and activation of c-Rel are tightly regulated on multiple levels, indicating the necessity to keep its functions under control. In this review we meta-analyze and integrate studies reporting gene locus aberrations to provide an overview on the frequency of <i>REL</i> gains in human B cell lymphoma subtypes, namely follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. We also summarize current knowledge on c-Rel expression and protein localization in these human B cell lymphomas and discuss the co-amplification of <i>BCL11A</i> with <i>REL</i>. In addition, we highlight and illustrate key pathways of c-Rel activation and regulation with a specific focus on B cell biology.	2020	09	30	Cancers (Basel)	Kober-Hasslacher	Maike
31312380		Molecular simulation studies on B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A).	B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) is a modulator of foetal-to-adult globin switching and is involved in brain development and normal lymphopoiesis. The three-dimensional structure of BCL11A and its structural domains had not yet been completely determined; hence, this study aimed to elucidate the structural domains of BCL11A. Molecular modelling and dynamics simulation studies were conducted using in silico tools with the templates selected based on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Ten protein models were generated using the MODELLER software, and the best model was selected according to the Discrete Optimised Protein Energy (DOPE) score and validated using the RAMPAGE server by evaluation of the Ramachandran plot. More than 93% of the amino acid residues of the best model of BCL11A were found to be in the favoured and allowed regions. The best model was validated using a 100-ns time span molecular dynamics simulation. The root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, and radius of gyration values were found to explain the stability of the best BCL11A protein molecular model generated in the study. The validated best model of the BCL11A protein may be useful for effective modulator studies on foetal-to-adult globin switching and related research.	2020	10	01	Am J Transl Res	Abdulazeez	Sayed
31362654	10.2174/1389450120666190726155733	Recent Progress in Gene Therapy and Other Targeted Therapeutic Approaches for Beta Thalassemia.	Beta-thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by the impaired synthesis of the betaglobin chain of adult hemoglobin. The disorder has a complex pathophysiology that affects multiple organ systems. The main complications of beta thalassemia are ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia and hemosiderosis-induced organ dysfunction. Regular blood transfusions are the main therapy for beta thalassemia major; however, this treatment can cause cardiac and hepatic hemosiderosis - the most common cause of death in these patients. This review focuses on unique future therapeutic interventions for thalassemia that reverse splenomegaly, reduce transfusion frequency, decrease iron toxicity in organs, and correct chronic anemia. The targeted effective protocols include hemoglobin fetal inducers, ineffective erythropoiesis correctors, antioxidants, vitamins, and natural products. Resveratrol is a new herbal therapeutic approach which serves as fetal Hb inducer in beta thalassemia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for beta thalassemia major and is preferred over iron chelation and blood transfusion for ensuring long life in these patients. Meanwhile, several molecular therapies, such as ActRIIB/IgG1 Fc recombinant protein, have emerged to address complications of beta thalassemia or the adverse effects of current drugs. Regarding gene correction strategies, a phase III trial called HGB-207 (Northstar-2; NCT02906202) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of autologous cell transplantation with LentiGlobin. Advanced gene-editing approaches aim to cut DNA at a targeted site and convert HbF to HbA during infancy, such as the suppression of BCL11A (B cell lymphoma 11A), HPFH (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) and zinc-finger nucleases. Gene therapy is progressing rapidly, with multiple clinical trials being conducted in many countries and the promise of commercial products to be available in the near future.	2020	09	14	Curr Drug Targets	Hamed	Eman M
31410080	10.3906/biy-1810-2	Systematic analysis of the frequently amplified 2p15-p16.1 locus reveals PAPOLG as a potential proto-oncogene in follicular and transformed follicular lymphoma.	Transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL) originates from histological transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL), which is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. High-resolution genomic copy-number analysis previously identified frequent amplification of the 2p15-p16.1 locus in FL and tFL cases. The genes (i.e. BCL11A, PAPOLG, PUS10, and USP34) in this amplified locus have not been systematically investigated to date in terms of their role in FL pathogenesis or transformation to tFL. Here we investigated the relationship between amplification and expression of genes in 2p15-p16.1 as well as their expression after histological transformation. NCBI GEO SNP array and gene expression profile (GEP) data of tFL cases were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between amplification and mRNA expression. Moreover, transcript levels of these four genes in FL cases were compared with those of patient-matched tFL cases and normal B-cells. Amplification of the 2p15-p16.1 locus is associated with increased transcription of BCL11A and PAPOLG in tFL cases, of which the latter showed increased expression after histological transformation. Compared with the level in normal B-cells, PAPOLG was significantly overexpressed in FL cases, but expression levels of the other three genes did not show any significant difference. Altogether these results suggest that PAPOLG may be the most critical gene in terms of transformation to tFL.	2020	09	30	Turk J Biol	Kurşun	Deniz
31654056	10.1042/BSR20190604	BCL11A: a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in human diseases.	Transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) gene encodes a zinc-finger protein that is predominantly expressed in brain and hematopoietic tissue. BCL11A functions mainly as a transcriptional repressor that is crucial in brain, hematopoietic system development, as well as fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switching. The expression of this gene is regulated by microRNAs, transcription factors and genetic variations. A number of studies have recently shown that BCL11A is involved in β-hemoglobinopathies, hematological malignancies, malignant solid tumors, 2p15-p16.1 microdeletion syndrome, and Type II diabetes. It has been suggested that BCL11A may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for some diseases. In this review, we summarize the current research state of BCL11A, including its biochemistry, expression, regulation, function, and its possible clinical application in human diseases.	2020	09	24	Biosci Rep	Yin	Jiawei
28544358	10.1111/ajco.12690	The expression pattern of Bcl11a, Mdm2 and Pten genes in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Bcl11a is closely associated with B-cell lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, little is known about the expression character of Bcl11a gene in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In previous study, our results showed there was a clear dysregulation in the global gene expression of the Bcl11a-suppressed B lymphoma cells. The aim of the study is to further evaluate the role of Bcl11a and the expression level of its related genes Mdm2, Pten in B-ALL patients. The relative mRNA expression levels of Bcl11a and Mdm2, Pten in blood mononuclear cells of B-ALL patients were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with SYBR Green Dye. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers served as control. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) was used as reference. There was higher Bcl11a mRNA expression in initial diagnosed B-ALL than the healthy control, but there is no statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05). The expression level of Bcl11a and Mdm2 in initial diagnosed B-ALL patients was statistically higher compared to those with complete remission (CR; P &lt; 0.05). The expression levels of Bcl11a and Mdm2, Pten in B-ALL patients with CR were decreased significantly when compared with the healthy control (P &lt; 0.05). The correlation analyses revealed that the Bcl11a expression level was positively correlated with the Mdm2 and Pten relative expression level in B-ALL patients. There is also positive correlation between Mdm2 and Pten expression. Bcl11a transcript levels were significantly downregulated in B-ALL patients with CR. The decreased expression characteristics of Bcl11a and Mdm2, Pten might imply the CR of B-ALL patients.	2018	05	22	Asia Pac J Clin Oncol	Xu	Ling
29581848	10.18632/oncotarget.24512	Aberrant expression of NKL homeobox gene HLX in Hodgkin lymphoma.	NKL homeobox genes are basic regulators of cell and tissue differentiation, many acting as oncogenes in T-cell leukemia. Recently, we described an hematopoietic NKL-code comprising six particular NKL homeobox genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and lymphoid progenitors, unmasking their physiological roles in the development of these cell types. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a B-cell malignancy showing aberrant activity of several developmental genes resulting in disturbed B-cell differentiation. To examine potential concordances in abnormal lymphoid differentiation of T- and B-cell malignancies we analyzed the expression of the hematopoietic NKL-code associated genes in HL, comprising HHEX, HLX, MSX1, NKX2-3, NKX3-1 and NKX6-3. Our approach revealed aberrant HLX activity in 8 % of classical HL patients and additionally in HL cell line L-540. Accordingly, to identify upstream regulators and downstream target genes of HLX we used L-540 cells as a model and performed chromosome and genome analyses, comparative expression profiling and functional assays via knockdown and overexpression experiments therein. These investigations excluded chromosomal rearrangements of the HLX locus at 1q41 and demonstrated that STAT3 operated directly as transcriptional activator of the HLX gene. Moreover, subcellular analyses showed highly enriched STAT3 protein in the nucleus of L-540 cells which underwent cytoplasmic translocation by repressing deacetylation. Finally, HLX inhibited transcription of B-cell differentiation factors MSX1, BCL11A and SPIB and of pro-apoptotic factor BCL2L11/BIM, thereby suppressing Etoposide-induced cell death. Collectively, we propose that aberrantly expressed NKL homeobox gene HLX is part of a pathological gene network in HL, driving deregulated B-cell differentiation and survival.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Nagel	Stefan
29975921	10.1159/000491526	MiR-137 Suppresses Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Stemness and Tumorigenesis by Perturbing BCL11A-DNMT1 Interaction.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is resistant to conventional chemotherapy due to high proportions of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The aim of this study is to unravel the miR-137-mediated regulatory mechanism of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) in TNBC. A corhort of 34 TNBC tumor tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues, as well as 25 non-TNBC tumor tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were collected post-operatively from patients with breast cancer. Q-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA levels of miR-137 and BCL11A in breast tissues and cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay were used to verify the direct interaction between miR-137 and BCL11A. After up-/down-regulation of BCL11A, miR-137, or DNMT1 via lentiviral transduction in TNBC cell lines SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, Q-PCR and Western blot assays were used to detect the expression levels of BCL11A, DNA methyltransferases 1 (DNMT1), and Islet-1 (ISL1). Mammosphere assay was conducted to assess tumorosphere formation ability of cells, coupled with flow cytometry to determine the percentage of breast cancer stem cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the interaction between BCL11A and DNMT1. Xenograft tumorigenesis assay was performed to monitor tumor formation in vivo. BCL11A was highly expressed in TNBC, whereas miR-137 was significantly lower in both TNBC tissues and cell lines. miR-137 suppressed BCL11A expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeting its 3'UTR. In both SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, overexpression of miR-137 or knockdown of BCL11A reduced the number of tumoroshperes and the percentage of cancer stem cells in vitro, and inhibited tumor development in vivo. Furthermore, BCL11A interacted with DNMT1 in TNBC cells. Silencing of either BCL11A or DNMT1 impaired cancer stemness and tumorigenesis of TNBC via suppressing ISL1 expression both in vitro, and in vivo. By perturbing BCL11A-DNMT1 interaction, miR-137 impairs cancer stemness and suppresses tumor development in TNBC.	2018	08	17	Cell Physiol Biochem	Chen	Feiyu
30289070	10.2174/1566524018666181004121604	Genetic Modifiers of Fetal Haemoglobin (HbF) and Phenotypic Severity in β-Thalassemia Patients.	The phenotypic severity of β-thalassemia is highly modulated by three genetic modifiers: β-globin (HBB) mutations, co-inheritance of α-thalassemia and polymorphisms in the genes associated with fetal haemoglobin (HbF) production. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of HbF related polymorphisms mainly in the HBB cluster, BCL11A (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A) and HBS1L-MYB (HBS1-like translational GTPase-MYB protooncogene, transcription factor) with regards to clinical severity. A total of 149 patients were included in the study. HBA and HBB mutations were characterised using multiplex PCR, Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification. In addition, 35 HbF polymorphisms were genotyped using mass spectrometry and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP). The genotype-phenotype association was analysed using SPSS version 22. Twenty-one HBB mutations were identified in the study population. Patients with HBB mutations had heterogeneous phenotypic severity due to the presence of other secondary modifiers. Co-inheritance of α-thalassemia (n = 12) alleviated disease severity of β-thalassemia. In addition, three polymorphisms (HBS1LMYB, rs4895441 [P = 0.008, odds ratio (OR) = 0.38 (0.18, 0.78)], rs9376092 [P = 0.030, OR = 0.36 (0.14, 0.90)]; and olfactory receptor [OR51B2] rs6578605 [P = 0.018, OR = 0.52 (0.31, 0.89)]) were associated with phenotypic severity. Secondary analysis of the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms with HbF levels revealed three nominally significant SNPs: rs6934903, rs9376095 and rs9494149 in HBS1L-MYB. This study revealed 3 types of HbF polymorphisms that play an important role in ameliorating disease severity of β-thalassemia patients which may be useful as a predictive marker in clinical management.	2019	09	30	Curr Mol Med	Razak	S A A
30821197	10.1080/03630269.2018.1515774	BCL11A Down-Regulation Induces γ-Globin in Human β-Thalassemia Major Erythroid Cells.	Fetal hemoglobin (Hb F, α2γ2) is a potent genetic modifier of the severity of β-thalassemia (β-thal) and sickle cell anemia. Differences in the levels of HbF that persist into adulthood affect the severity of sickle cell disease and the β-thal syndromes. B-cell lymphoma 11 A (BCL11A) is a potent silencer of HbF. Here, we reactivated γ-globin expression by down-regulating BCL11A to alleviate anemia in the β-thal major (β-TM) patients. BCL11A were down-regulated by lentiviral RNAi (RNA interference) in the K562 cell line and an in vitro culture model of human erythropoiesis in which erythroblasts are derived from the normal donor mononuclear cells (MNC) or β-TM MNC. The expression of γ-globin were analyzed by qPCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) and Western blot techniques. Our data showed that down-regulation of BCL11A induces γ-globin production in the K562 cell line and human erythrocytes from normal donors and β-TM donors, without altering erythroid maturation. This is the first report on γ-globin induction by down-regulation of BCL11A in human erythroblasts derived from β-TM.	2019	06	18	Hemoglobin	Li	Jing
31938433		Clinical significance of BCL11A expression in ER-negative and PR-negative endometrial carcinoma.	To study the mechanism and clinical significance of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) gene in the development of endometrial carcinoma (EC). 100 EC, 20 normal endometrium and 20 atypical hyperplasia endometrium specimens were collected from West China Second University Hospital from January 2005 to January 2015. The expression of BCL11A was detected by immunohistochemistry and its relationships with clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed. The expression of BCL11A in ER-/PR-EC was higher than that in normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia endometrium, and ER+/PR+EC (P &lt; 0.001). The expression of BCL11A in EC was associated with age, menopause, EC classification, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, tumor differentiation, histological type, ER/PR expression and p53 expression (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of BCL11A in the deceased group was significantly higher than that in the survival group (P = 0.011). Survival analysis indicated that the high expression of BCL11A was associated with low survival rate (P &lt; 0.001). BCL11A may play an important role in the development of ER-/PR-EC. It may serve as a potential target for therapy and a predict factor for prognosis. It can also provide molecular basis for new EC classification.	2020	01	19	Int J Clin Exp Pathol	You	Di
27786413	10.1002/pbc.26251	DNA methylation profiling of pediatric B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia with KMT2A rearrangement identifies hypomethylation at enhancer sites.	Deregulation of the epigenome is an important pathogenetic mechanism in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2A rearrangement (KMT2Ar). We performed array-based DNA methylation profiling of KMT2Ar ALL cells from 26 children in comparison to normal B-cell precursors. Significant changes in DNA methylation in KMT2Ar ALL were identified in 2,545 CpG loci, influenced by age and the translocation partners AFF1 and MLLT1. In KMT2Ar ALL, DNA methylation loss was enriched at enhancers and for certain transcription factor binding sites such as BCL11A, EBF, and MEF2A. In summary, DNA methylation changes in KMT2Ar ALL target enhancers, genes involved in leukemogenesis and normal hematopoiesis, as well as transcription factor networks.	2017	06	21	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Bergmann	Anke K
28225775	10.1371/journal.pone.0171116	Genetic polymorphisms and plasma levels of BCL11A contribute to the development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.	We investigated the association between B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) rs11886868 and rs4671393 polymorphism, plasma BCL11A concentration, and the hazard of developing laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In this research, 330 LSCC patients, 310 healthy controls, and 155 vocal leukoplakia patients were genotyped for the BCL11A (rs11886868 C/T and rs4671393 A/G) genotypes by pyrosequencing; the BCL11A concentration was measured using ELISA. LSCC Patients had a notably higher occurrence of CT at rs11886868 (OR = 2.64, P = 0.025) than the control group; they also had higher GG at rs4671393 (OR = 2.53, P = 0.018). Advanced (III and IV) stage LSCC patients had a notably greater frequency of CT at rs11886868 than those with initial (I and II) stage LSCC (OR = 2.71, P = 0.044 vs. OR = 2.58, P = 0.051). Additionally, there was a 1.59 fold increase in susceptibility for initial stage LSCC related to the G allele (AG/GG) at rs4671393 (P = 0.005); while for patients of advanced stage LSCC the OR was 1.73 (P = 0.002). Moreover, the OR of lymph node metastasis patients at rs4671393 G alleles was 2.41 (P &lt; 0.01); it was 1.38 (P = 0.035) in patients without lymph metastasis. Patients with high incidences of the rs4671393 variation genotype had high plasma BCL11A levels. BCL11A rs11886868 and rs4671393 genotype variations and correspondingly high BCL11A plasma levels are related to LSCC, besides, differences in plasma levels and genotype distribution may be related to lymph node metastasis status and the stage of LSCC.	2017	08	21	PLoS One	Zhou	Jian

28493377	10.1002/eji.201646621	Neonatal myeloid derived suppressor cells show reduced apoptosis and immunosuppressive activity upon infection with Escherichia coli.	Susceptibility to infection during the neonatal period and reduced control of inflammation in neonates are attributed to immunosuppression persisting from fetal life. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature myeloid progenitors with suppressive activity and increased numbers in cord blood. We hypothesized that MDSCs contribute to innate host defence in neonates, paralleled by anti-inflammatory signalling.Phagocytic activity, infection induced apoptosis, expression of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family proteins, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokine production and T-cell suppression of neonatal granulocytic-MDSCs (G-MDSCs) after infection with Escherichia coli (E. coli) were compared to neonatal autologous mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Phagocytic activity of G-MDSCs upon infection with E. coli was equal to that of mature PMNs, however, apoptosis of G-MDSCs was decreased. G-MDSCs showed enhanced Bcl-2-expression and lower ROS production compared to PMNs. Inhibition of Bcl-2 reduced apoptosis rates of G-MDSCs to that of mature PMNs. Induction of anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) was enhanced, while pro-inflammatory IL-8 decreased in G-MDSCs compared to PMNs. Infected G-MDSCs strongly suppressed proliferation of T cells. We show a direct role of G-MDSCs for anti-bacterial host defence. Prolonged survival and anti-inflammatory capacity suggest that G-MDSCs are important for immune-regulation after bacterial infection.	2017	09	20	Eur J Immunol	Leiber	Anja
29018799	10.3389/fmed.2017.00153	TruSeq-Based Gene Expression Analysis of Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Samples: Subgroup Analysis Results and Elucidation of Biases from FFPE Sample Processing on the TruSeq Platform.	Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies with courses ranging from indolent to potentially lethal. We recently studied in a 157 patient cohort gene expression profiles generated by the TruSeq targeted RNA gene expression sequencing. We observed that the sequencing library quality and depth from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin samples were significantly lower when biopsies were obtained prior to 2009. We also observed that the fresh CTCL samples clustered together, even though they included stage I-IV disease. In this study, we compared TruSeq gene expression patterns in older (≤2008) vs. more recent (≥2009) FFPE samples to determine whether these clustering analyses and earlier described differentially expressed gene findings are robust when analyzed based on the year of biopsy. We also explored biases found in FFPE samples when subjected to the TruSeq analysis of gene expression. Our results showed that ≤2008 and ≥2009 samples clustered equally well to the full data set and, importantly, both analyses produced nearly identical trends and findings. Specifically, both analyses enriched nearly identical DEGs when comparing benign vs. (1) stage I-IV and (2) stage IV (alone) CTCL samples. Results obtained using either ≤2008 or ≥2009 samples were strongly correlated. Furthermore, by using subgroup analyses, we were able to identify additional novel differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which did not reach statistical significance in the prior full data set analysis. Those included CTCL-upregulated <i>BCL11A, SELL, IRF1, SMAD1, CASP1, BIRC5</i>, and <i>MAX</i> and CTCL-downregulated <i>MDM4, SERPINB3</i>, and <i>THBS4</i> genes. With respect to sample biases, no matter if we performed subgroup analyses or full data set analysis, fresh samples tightly clustered together. While principal component analysis revealed that fresh samples were spatially closer together, indicating some preprocessing batch effect, they remained in the proximity to other normal/benign and FFPE CTCL samples and were not clustering as outliers by themselves. Notably, this did not affect the determination of DEGs when analyzing ≥2009 samples (fresh and FFPE biopsies) vs. ≥2009 FFPE samples alone.	2021	01	03	Front Med (Lausanne)	Lefrançois	Philippe
26862517	10.22074/cellj.2016.3808	MicroRNA Expression in β-Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease: A Role in The Induction of Fetal Hemoglobin.	Today the regulatory role of microRNAs (miRs) is well characterized in many diverse cel- lular processes. MiR-based regulation is categorized under epigenetic regulatory mecha- nisms. These small non-coding RNAs participate in producing and maturing erythrocytes, expressing hematopoietic factors and regulating expression of globin genes by post-tran- scriptional gene silencing. The changes in expression of miRs (miR-144/-320/-451/-503) in thalassemic/sickle cells compared with normal erythrocytes may cause clinical severity. According to the suppressive effects of certain miRs (miR-15a/-16-1/-23a/-26b/-27a/-451) on a number of transcription factors [myeloblastosis oncogene (MYB), B-cell lymphoma 11A (BCL11A), GATA1, Krüppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1)] during β globin gene expression, It has been possible to increasing γ globin gene expression and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. Therefore, this strategy can be used as a novel therapy in infusing HbF and improving clinical complications of patients with hemoglobi- nopathies. 	2016	02	10	Cell J	Saki	Najmaldin
27340226	10.1093/hmg/ddw170	Hemoglobin genetics: recent contributions of GWAS and gene editing.	The β-hemoglobinopathies are inherited disorders resulting from altered coding potential or expression of the adult β-globin gene. Impaired expression of β-globin reduces adult hemoglobin (α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) production, the hallmark of β-thalassemia. A single-base mutation at codon 6 leads to formation of HbS (α<sub>2</sub>β<sup>S</sup><sub>2</sub>) and sickle cell disease. While the basis of these diseases is known, therapy remains largely supportive. Bone marrow transplantation is the only curative therapy. Patients with elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>) as adults exhibit reduced symptoms and enhanced survival. The β-globin gene locus is a paradigm of cell- and developmental stage-specific regulation. Although the principal erythroid cell transcription factors are known, mechanisms responsible for silencing of the γ-globin gene were obscure until application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we review findings in the field. GWAS identified BCL11A as a candidate negative regulator of γ-globin expression. Subsequent studies have established BCL11A as a quantitative repressor. GWAS-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms lie within an essential erythroid enhancer of the BCL11A gene. Disruption of a discrete region within the enhancer reduces BCL11A expression and induces HbF expression, providing the basis for gene therapy using gene editing tools. A recently identified, second silencing factor, leukemia/lymphoma-related factor/Pokemon, shares features with BCL11A, including interaction with the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase repressive complex. These findings suggest involvement of a common pathway for HbF silencing. In addition, we discuss other factors that may be involved in γ-globin gene silencing and their potential manipulation for therapeutic benefit in treating the β-hemoglobinopathies.	2018	09	17	Hum Mol Genet	Smith	Elenoe C
27653684	10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.064	Bcl11a Deficiency Leads to Hematopoietic Stem Cell Defects with an Aging-like Phenotype.	B cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) is a transcription factor and regulator of hemoglobin switching that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for sickle cell disease and thalassemia. In the hematopoietic system, BCL11A is required for B lymphopoiesis, yet its role in other hematopoietic cells, especially hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains elusive. The extensive expression of BCL11A in hematopoiesis implicates context-dependent roles, highlighting the importance of fully characterizing its function as part of ongoing efforts for stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Here, we demonstrate that BCL11A is indispensable for normal HSC function. Bcl11a deficiency results in HSC defects, typically observed in the aging hematopoietic system. We find that downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6), and the ensuing cell-cycle delay, correlate with HSC dysfunction. Our studies define a mechanism for BCL11A in regulation of HSC function and have important implications for the design of therapeutic approaches to targeting BCL11A.	2018	02	09	Cell Rep	Luc	Sidinh
27774950		[Knock-down of BCL11A expression in breast cancer cells promotes MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis].	Objective To detect the expression and pathological significance of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) in breast cancer and investigate the effect of its silencing on the apoptosis of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. MethodsImmunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of BCL11A in 62 cases of human breast cancer tissues and 8 cases of normal tissues. We synthesized siRNA targeting BCL11A, and then siRNA was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells. Forty-eight hours later, the suppression effect of siRNA on BCL11A was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. The apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells was detected by flow cytometry. Results The BCL11A protein was mainly expressed in cytoplasm. The expression level of BCL11A in breast cancer tissues was higher than that in paracancerous tissues. The expression had correlations with tumor grade, tumor stage, while it had no correlations with the patients' age and tumor size. BCL11A-siRNA significantly suppressed the expression of BCL11A mRNA and protein as compared with the control group. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with BCL11A-siRNA had higher apoptosis rate compared with the control group. Conclusion The BCL11A protein is highly expressed in breast cancer and knock-down of BCL11A promotes the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells.	2017	06	13	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Li	Hongli
24796653	10.1111/1753-0407.12163	Decreased miR-146 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is correlated with ongoing islet autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes patients 1miR-146.	Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease mediated by autoimmune attack against pancreatic β-cells. It has been reported that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including T1D. The aim of the present study was to identify pathogenic miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of T1D patients. Global miRNA and mRNA expression was profiled in PBMC from 12 patients with newly diagnosed T1D and 10 normal controls. Differently expressed miRNAs were validated in an independent set of patients and controls. The dynamic changes in miRNA and target gene expression were analyzed in T1D patients treated with either a short (6 months) or long (12-24 months) course of insulin. The association between miRNA expression and serum glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) titers was also investigated. Compared with normal controls, there were 26 miRNAs and 1218 genes differently expressed in PBMC of patients with newly diagnosed T1D. The greatest downregulation was for miR-146a (48% decrease; P &lt; 0.05). Expression of its target genes, predicted to be tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), B cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A), syntaxin 3 (STX3) and numb homolog (NUMB), was upregulated. Moreover, T1D patients on long-course insulin and optimized glucose control had sustained low expression of miR-146. Interestingly, decreased miR-146a expression was significantly associated with high serum GADA titers (P &lt; 0.05). The results suggest that dysregulation of miR-146 expression in PBMC may be associated with the ongoing autoimmune imbalance in T1D patients.	2015	10	29	J Diabetes	Yang	Minglan
25979662	10.1016/j.ejmg.2015.04.006	Brain malformations in a patient with deletion 2p16.1: A refinement of the phenotype to BCL11A.	Microdeletions of 2p15-16.1 have been reported in 15 patients with a recognizable syndrome of dysmorphic features, intellectual disability and microcephaly. Facial features include telecanthus, short palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a broad nasal root, smooth and long philtrum and large ears. Brain malformations can be observed in this syndrome and include hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and a simplified cortical gyral pattern. Case reports have narrowed the critical region of the neurodevelopmental phenotype to a region that spans the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) gene. Here we present a 3-year-old normocephalic girl with moderate development delay and dysmorphic features including a prominent forehead, telecanthus, depressed nasal bridge, thin upper vermilion and a small chin. Magnetic resonance imaging shows enlargement of the lateral, third and fourth ventricles and hypoplastic corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis and pons. Array CGH revealed a 0.875 Mb de novo deletion at 2p16.1 that includes only BCL11A. The moderate delays, hypoplastic and dysmorphic corpus callosum and hippocampi and the facial features are in keeping with the previously described 2p15-16.1 microdeletion syndrome. However, hypoplasia of the pons and cerebellum are not commonly recognized features and are reminiscent of the brain malformations observed in individuals with a mutation in CASK. CASK is known to interact with BCL11A in the normal growth of axons. This case report highlights the role of BCL11A in 2p15-16.1 microdeletion syndrome and the unique phenotype suggests a common pathway for BCL11A and other genes in neurodevelopment. 	2016	03	04	Eur J Med Genet	Balci	Tugce B
26342260	10.1016/j.exphem.2015.08.011	Development and characterization of K562 cell clones expressing BCL11A-XL: Decreased hemoglobin production with fetal hemoglobin inducers and its rescue with mithramycin.	Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a promising strategy in the treatment of β-thalassemia, in which production of adult hemoglobin (HbA) is impaired by mutations affecting the β-globin gene. Recent results indicate that B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) is a major repressor of γ-globin gene expression. Therefore, disrupting the binding of the BCL11A transcriptional repressor complex to the γ-globin gene promoter provides a novel approach for inducing expression of the γ-globin genes. To develop a cellular screening system for the identification of BCL11A inhibitors, we produced K562 cell clones with integrated copies of a BCL11A-XL expressing vector. We characterized 12 K562 clones expressing different levels of BCL11A-XL and found that a clear inverse relationship does exist between the levels of BCL11A-XL and the extent of hemoglobinization induced by a panel of HbF inducers. Using mithramycin as an inducer, we found that this molecule was the only HbF inducer efficient in rescuing the ability to differentiate along the erythroid program, even in K562 cell clones expressing high levels of BCL11A-XL, suggesting that BCL11A-XL activity is counteracted by mithramycin. 	2016	03	18	Exp Hematol	Finotti	Alessia
26487345	10.1038/srep15215	Transcription factor and miRNA co-regulatory network reveals shared and specific regulators in the development of B cell and T cell.	The maturation process of lymphocyte was related to many blood diseases, such as lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia. Many TFs and miRNAs were separately studied in the development of B and T cells. In this study, we aim to discover the TF and miRNA co-regulation and identify key regulators in the B and T cells maturation. We obtained the candidate genes, miRNAs and TFs for each stage of their maturation, then constructed the TF-miRNA-gene feed-forward loops (FFLs) for each stage by our previous methods. Statistical test for FFLs indicated their enrichment and significance. TF-miRNA co-regulatory networks for each stage were constructed by combining their FFLs. Hub analysis revealed the key regulators in each stage, for example, MYC, STAT5A, PAX5 and miR-17 ~ 92 in the transition of pro-B cells into pre-B cells. We also identified a few common regulators and modules in two stages of B cell maturation (e.g. miR-146a/NFKB1/BCL11A) and two stages of T cell maturation (e.g. miR-20/CCND2/SORL1), as well as some shared regulators in the early stages of both B and T cell development. Our network will help to increase understanding of mature process of B and T cell, as well as the related blood diseases.	2016	09	14	Sci Rep	Lin	Ying
23432949	10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000078	Concurrent rearrangements of BCL2, BCL3, and BCL11A genes in atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	The most frequent chromosomal aberrations with the well established prognostic meaning in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are +12, del(11q), del(13q), and del(17p). Less common translocations lead to deregulation of genes primarily due to juxtaposition with IGH gene. We present a case of CLL patient with atypical morphology and an aggressive course of disease. In spite of aggressive treatment including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation disease progressed into a rare cutaneous Richter's syndrome. Trisomy 12 was found as a sole chromosomal change at initial cytogenetic analysis of lymphoma cells. At progression, besides trisomy 12 three concomitant balanced translocations t(2;14)(p13;q32), t(14;19)(q32;q13), and t(18;22)(q21;q11) were found. The same karyotype was confirmed in cells aspirated from skin infiltrates at Richter transformation. Atypical cytological features, trisomy 12, and a progressive course of disease observed in our case are typical for CLL with each of particular Ig translocations that were concomitantly found in CLL for the first time. Similar to ""double hit"" lymphoma concurrent rearrangements may be relevant also in CLL. 	2014	10	09	Hematology	Podgornik	Helena
24344258	10.1073/pnas.1321704111	Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C binds to BATF/IRF4 or SPI1/IRF4 composite sites and recruits Sin3A to repress CDKN2A.	Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) repression of CDKN2A p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) is essential for immortal human B-lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) growth. EBNA3C ChIP-sequencing identified &gt;13,000 EBNA3C sites in LCL DNA. Most EBNA3C sites were associated with active transcription; 64% were strong H3K4me1- and H3K27ac-marked enhancers and 16% were active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. Using ENCODE LCL transcription factor ChIP-sequencing data, EBNA3C sites coincided (±250 bp) with RUNX3 (64%), BATF (55%), ATF2 (51%), IRF4 (41%), MEF2A (35%), PAX5 (34%), SPI1 (29%), BCL11a (28%), SP1 (26%), TCF12 (23%), NF-κB (23%), POU2F2 (23%), and RBPJ (16%). EBNA3C sites separated into five distinct clusters: (i) Sin3A, (ii) EBNA2/RBPJ, (iii) SPI1, and (iv) strong or (v) weak BATF/IRF4. EBNA3C signals were positively affected by RUNX3, BATF/IRF4 (AICE) and SPI1/IRF4 (EICE) cooccupancy. Gene set enrichment analyses correlated EBNA3C/Sin3A promoter sites with transcription down-regulation (P &lt; 1.6 × 10(-4)). EBNA3C signals were strongest at BATF/IRF4 and SPI1/IRF4 composite sites. EBNA3C bound strongly to the p14(ARF) promoter through SPI1/IRF4/BATF/RUNX3, establishing RBPJ-, Sin3A-, and REST-mediated repression. EBNA3C immune precipitated with Sin3A and conditional EBNA3C inactivation significantly decreased Sin3A binding at the p14(ARF) promoter (P &lt; 0.05). These data support a model in which EBNA3C binds strongly to BATF/IRF4/SPI1/RUNX3 sites to enhance transcription and recruits RBPJ/Sin3A- and REST/NRSF-repressive complexes to repress p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) expression. 	2014	03	12	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Jiang	Sizun
24832791	10.1002/gcc.22184	Amplification of 2p as a genomic marker for transformation in lymphoma.	To outline further genetic mechanisms of transformation from follicular lymphoma (FL) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we have performed whole genome array-CGH in 81 tumors from 60 patients [29 de novo DLBCL (dnDLBCL), 31 transformed DLBCL (tDLBCL), and 21 antecedent FL]. In 15 patients, paired tumor samples (primary FL and a subsequent tDLBCL) were available, among which three possessed more than two subsequent tumors, allowing us to follow specific genetic alterations acquired before, during, and after the transformation. Gain of 2p15-16.1 encompassing, among others, the REL, BCL11A, USP34, COMMD1, and OTX1 genes was found to be more common in the tDLBCL compared with dnDLBCL (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, a high-level amplification of 2p15-16.1 was also detected in the FL stage prior to transformation, indicating its importance during the transformation event. Quantitative real-time PCR showed a higher level of amplification of REL, USP34, and COMMD1 (all involved in the NFκΒ-pathway) compared with BCL11A, which indicates that the altered genes disrupting the NFκΒ pathway may be the driver genes of transformation rather than the previously suggested BCL11A. Moreover, a 17q21.33 amplification was exclusively found in tDLBCL, never in FL (P &lt; 0.04) or dnDLBCL, indicating an upregulation of genes of importance during the later phase of transformation. Taken together, our study demonstrates potential genomic markers for disease progression to clinically more aggressive forms. We also confirm the importance of the TP53-, CDKN2A-, and NFκΒ-pathways for the transformation from FL to DLBCL.	2015	02	26	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	Kwiecinska	Anna
24961604	10.1186/2047-783X-19-34	Combination of BCL11A siRNA with vincristine increases the apoptosis of SUDHL6 cells.	B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11 A (BCL11A) is associated with human B cell malignancy initiation. Our previous study has shown that downregulation of BCL11A mRNA by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is capable of inducing apoptosis in the SUDHL6 cell line. To further explore the effects of BCL11A siRNA on the enhanced cytotoxicity of a chemotherapeutic drug, we investigated the effects of BCL11A siRNA combined with vincristine (VCR) on SUDHL6 cell proliferation and apoptosis. Chemically synthesized BCL11A siRNA was transfected into SUDHL6 cells using the HiPerFect Transfection Reagent in combination with VCR. Cell proliferation was measured by the CCK8 assay. The morphology of apoptotic cells was observed with Hoechst 33258 staining. The rate of cell apoptosis was determined by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. After BCL11A siRNA plus VCR treatment, cell proliferation was significantly decreased in comparison with VCR or BCL11A siRNA treatment alone and negative control siRNA plus VCR treatment (P &lt;0.05). The apoptotic rate of BCL11A siRNA plus VCR treated cells was significantly increased compared with BCL11A siRNA and VCR treatment alone and negative control siRNA plus VCR treatment (P &lt;0.05). The combination of BCL11A siRNA and VCR increases apoptosis in SUDHL6 cells. Our study implies that BCL11A siRNA in combination with VCR may be a useful approach for improving effective treatment for B cell lymphoma.	2014	10	16	Eur J Med Res	He	Dongmei
25044937	10.1002/cbin.10332	Gene expression profile analysis of SUDHL6 cells with siRNA-mediated BCL11A downregulation.	Our previous study has shown that downregulation of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma11A (BCL11A) gene by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the growth inhibition and apoptosis of B cell lymphoma cell line SUDHL6. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of this process and identify the differentially expressed genes in SUDHL6 cells after BCL11A downregulation, the global gene expression profile was identified and analyzed using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes were validated and analyzed from the BCL11A siRNA-treated SUDHL6 cells. There was a significant dysregulation in the global gene expression of the BCL11A-suppressed SUDHL6 cells. There were 1903 genes differentially expressed with &gt;2-fold changes between the BCL11A siRNA- and negative control-transfected cells. Of these, there were 916 upregulated genes and 987 downregulated genes. The differential genes are involved in various molecular functions and signaling pathways. QRT-PCR validation of the selected differentially expressed genes demonstrated there was a good correlation with the microarray analysis. There was a significant deregulation of expression in the apoptosis-related genes such as BCL-2, BCL2L11 and involved in TGFβ, MAPK, WNT signaling pathways after BCL11A was downregulated in SUDHL6 cells. Our results show that the suppression of BCL11A by RNA interference altered gene expression profile of SUDHL6 cells. The apoptosis-related genes BCL-2, BCL2L11 and the gene alterations in TGFβ, MAPK, WNT signaling pathways might be important in BCL11A siRNA-induced apoptosis of SUDHL6 cells, suggesting BCL11A is involved in gene networks associated with apoptosis. 	2015	06	22	Cell Biol Int	Wu	Hong
25364581	10.7497/j.issn.2095-3941.2014.03.006	The gene expression patterns of BMPR2, EP300, TGFβ2, and TNFAIP3 in B-Lymphoma cells.	The results of a previous study showed that a clear dysregulation was evident in the global gene expression of the BCL11A-suppressed B-lymphoma cells. In this study, the bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type II (BMPR2), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2), and tumor necrosis factor, and alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene expression patterns in B-cell malignancies were studied. The relative expression levels of BMPR2, EP300, TGFβ2, and TNFAIP3 mRNA in B-lymphoma cell lines, myeloid cell lines, as well as in cells from healthy volunteers, were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with SYBR Green Dye. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as reference. The expression level of TGFβ2 mRNA in B-lymphoma cell lines was significantly higher than those in the cells from the healthy control (P&lt;0.05). However, the expression level of TNFAIP3 mRNA in B-malignant cells was significantly lower than that of the healthy control (P&lt;0.05). The expression levels of BMPR2 and EP300 mRNA showed no significant difference between B-malignant cell lines and the healthy group (P&gt;0.05). In B-lymphoma cell lines, correlation analyses revealed that the expression of BMPR2 and TNFAIP3 (r=0.882, P=0.04) had significant positive relation. The expression levels of BMPR2, EP300, and TNFAIP3 mRNA in cell lines from myeloid leukemia were significantly lower than those in the cells from the healthy control (P&lt;0.05). The expression levels of TGFβ2 mRNA showed no significant difference between myeloid leukemia cell lines and the healthy control or B-malignant cell lines (P&gt;0.05). The expression levels of BMPR2, EP300, and TNFAIP3 mRNA in B-lymphoma cells were significantly higher than those of the myeloid leukemia cells (P&lt;0.05). Different expression patterns of BMPR2, EP300, TGFβ2, and TNFAIP3 genes in B-lymphoma cells exist.	2014	11	03	Cancer Biol Med	He	Dong-Mei
22890838	10.1002/ijc.27774	High-resolution genomic profiling reveals clonal evolution and competition in gastrointestinal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and its large cell variant.	We studied marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract including seven small cell lymphomas, eight large cell areas of composite lymphomas and 13 large cell variants using SNP array profiling. We found an increase of genomic complexity with lymphoma progression from small to large cytology, and identified gains of prominent (proto) oncogenes such as REL, BCL11A, ETS1, PTPN1, PTEN and KRAS which were found exclusively in the large cell variants. Copy numbers of ADAM3A, SCAPER and SIRPB1 were varying between the three different modes of presentation, hence suggestive for aberrations associated with progression from small to large cell lymphoma. The number of aberrations was slightly higher in the large cell part of composite lymphomas than in large cell lymphomas, suggesting that clonal selection takes place and that composite lymphomas are in a transition state. To further investigate this, we comparatively analyzed samples of two morphologically different regions of the same small cell tumor with a BIRC3-MALT1 translocation, as well as material acquired at two different time points from one composite lymphoma. We found genomic heterogeneity in both cases, supporting the theory of competing subclones in the evolution and progression of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.	2013	01	29	Int J Cancer	Flossbach	Lucia
23361909	10.1182/blood-2012-06-434530	Erythropoiesis and globin switching in compound Klf1::Bcl11a mutant mice.	B-cell lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) downregulation in human primary adult erythroid progenitors results in elevated expression of fetal γ-globin. Recent reports showed that BCL11A expression is activated by KLF1, leading to γ-globin repression. To study regulation of erythropoiesis and globin expression by KLF1 and BCL11A in an in vivo model, we used mice carrying a human β-globin locus transgene with combinations of Klf1 knockout, Bcl11a floxed, and EpoR(Cre) knockin alleles. We found a higher percentage of reticulocytes in adult Klf1(wt/ko) mice and a mild compensated anemia in Bcl11a(cko/cko) mice. These phenotypes were more pronounced in compound Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) mice. Analysis of Klf1(wt/ko), Bcl11a(cko/cko), and Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) mutant embryos demonstrated increased expression of mouse embryonic globins during fetal development. Expression of human γ-globin remained high in Bcl11a(cko/cko) embryos during fetal development, and this was further augmented in Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) embryos. After birth, expression of human γ-globin and mouse embryonic globins decreased in Bcl11a(cko/cko) and Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) mice, but the levels remained much higher than those observed in control animals. Collectively, our data support an important role for the KLF1-BCL11A axis in erythroid maturation and developmental regulation of globin expression.	2013	06	03	Blood	Esteghamat	Fatemehsadat
23758992	10.1186/1476-4598-12-61	BCL11A overexpression predicts survival and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and is modulated by microRNA-30a and gene amplification.	Aberrant activation of the proto-oncogene B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia and lymphoma. However, the clinical significance of BCL11A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. We examined BCL11A expression at the protein and mRNA levels in a cohort (n=114) of NSCLC patients and assessed the relationship between BCL11A expression and clinicopathological parameters. Data from array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and microRNA transfection experiments were integrated to explore the potential mechanisms of abnormal BCL11A activation in NSCLC. Compared to adjacent non-cancerous lung tissues, BCL11A expression levels were specifically upregulated in NSCLC tissues at both the mRNA (t=9.81, P&lt;0.001) and protein levels. BCL11A protein levels were higher in patients with squamous histology (χ2=15.81, P=0.001), smokers (χ2=8.92, P=0.004), patients with no lymph node involvement (χ2=5.14, P=0.029), and patients with early stage disease (χ2=3.91, P=0.048). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that in early stage NSCLC (IA-IIB), BCL11A was not only an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazards ratio [HR] 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.50, P&lt;0.001), but also for overall survival (HR=0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61, P=0.003). The average BCL11A expression level was much higher in SCC samples with amplifications than in those without amplifications (t=3.30, P=0.023). Assessing functionality via an in vitro luciferase reporter system and western blotting, we found that the BCL11A protein was a target of miR-30a. Our results demonstrated that proto-oncogene BCL11A activation induced by miR-30a and gene amplification may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for effective management of this disease.	2013	11	05	Mol Cancer	Jiang	Ben-yuan
23815911	10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.018	[Effect of BCL11A gene on transcription of γ-globin gene].	This study was aimed to explore the effect of BCL11A gene on transcription of γ-globin gene in K562 cells. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) gene was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors in K562 cells (human erythroblastic leukemia cell line). Gamma-globin mRNA level in K562 cells was determined by RT-PCR. Association between the BCL11A gene and γ-globin gene transcription was explored by comparison of mRNA levels. The results indicated that the silence rate of the BCL11A gene in K562 cells by 4 siRNA expression vectors was 49.7%, 55.4%, 78.2%, and 84.1%, respectively. The siRNA expression vector with 84.1% silence rate was transfected into K562 cells, transcription level of γ-globin mRNA in K562 cells transfected with siRNA expression vector increased 2.4 times as compared with control K562 cells. It is concluded that level of γ-globin mRNA increases when the BCL11A gene is silenced. It indicates that the BCL11A gene may be a negative regulator for γ-globin gene expression.	2014	05	05	Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Sun	Shun-Chang
24648892	10.3892/br.2012.9	Downregulation of BCL11A by siRNA induces apoptosis in B lymphoma cell lines.	The B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 11A gene (BCL11A) encodes a krüppel-like zinc finger protein, which is important in thymopoiesis and has been associated with hematopoietic malignancies. In this study, we investigated whether the downregulation of BCL11A mRNA by small interference RNA (siRNA) was capable of inducing apoptosis, and tested the effect of BCL11A siRNA combined with BCL2 siRNA in B lymphoma cell lines (SUDHL6, EB1). BCL11A siRNA was transfected into SUDHL6, EB1 cells with HiPerfect transfection reagents. After transient transfection with BCL11A siRNA, the expression levels of BCL11A mRNA and protein were assayed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. The cell proliferation was determined by a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay. Apoptosis was determined by morphological observation and flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that the expression levels of BCL11A mRNA and protein from SUDHL6, EB1 cells transfected with BCL11A siRNA decreased, compared with either the scrambled negative control siRNA group or untransfected cells group (P&lt;0.05). Viability of cells transfected with BCL11A siRNA was less compared to cells transfected with control siRNA and untransfected SUDHL6, EB1 cells, respectively (P&lt;0.05). BCL11A siRNA induced apoptosis in both SUDHL6 and EB1 cells. BCL11A siRNA combined with BCL2 siRNA significantly inhibited cell growth. Apoptotic rates of SUDHL6, EB1 cells treated with BCL11A siRNA combined with BCL2 siRNA significantly increased (P&lt;0.05), compared with either the scrambled control (Sc) siRNA and BCL2 siRNA combination or BCL2 or BCL11A siRNA-treated cells alone. Findings of this study suggest the downregulation of BCL11A mRNA by siRNA was able to induce apoptosis. Moreover, BCL11A siRNA combined with BCL2 siRNA increased apoptosis in SUDHL6, EB1 cells. Thus, suppression of BCL11A expression may be a useful approach in the treatment of B lymphoma.	2021	10	21	Biomed Rep	Gao	Yangjun
22582156	10.1007/s13205-011-0026-4	Comparative studies of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1: evidence for a eutherian mammalian origin for the GPIHBP1 gene from an LY6-like gene.	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) functions as a platform and transport agent for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) which functions in the hydrolysis of chylomicrons, principally in heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue capillary endothelial cells. Previous reports of genetic deficiency for this protein have described severe chylomicronemia. Comparative GPIHBP1 amino acid sequences and structures and GPIHBP1 gene locations were examined using data from several mammalian genome projects. Mammalian GPIHBP1 genes usually contain four coding exons on the positive strand. Mammalian GPIHBP1 sequences shared 41-96% identities as compared with 9-32% sequence identities with other LY6-domain-containing human proteins (LY6-like). The human N-glycosylation site was predominantly conserved among other mammalian GPIHBP1 proteins except cow, dog and pig. Sequence alignments, key amino acid residues and conserved predicted secondary structures were also examined, including the N-terminal signal peptide, the acidic amino acid sequence region which binds LPL, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage group, the Ly6 domain and the C-terminal α-helix. Comparative and phylogenetic studies of mammalian GPIHBP1 suggested that it originated in eutherian mammals from a gene duplication event of an ancestral LY6-like gene and subsequent integration of exon 2, which may have been derived from BCL11A (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A gene) encoding an extended acidic amino acid sequence.

21366467	10.5858/2009-0463-RSR.1	Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma: a short review with brief discussion of mediastinal gray zone lymphoma.	Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It commonly presents as a bulky lesion in the anterior-superior mediastinum with symptoms related to local invasion or compression. Microscopic examination typically shows infiltration of medium-large cells surrounded by collagen fibrosis. The neoplastic cells express B-cell markers, and CD30 often shows heterogeneous staining. Comparative genomic hybridization has identified gains in loci of 9p24 and 2p15 as well as Xp11.4-21 and Xq24-26. Amplification of REL and BCL11A at 2p as well as elevated expression of JAK2, PDL1, and PDL2 at 9p has been demonstrated. Nodular sclerosis classic Hodgkin lymphoma needs to be differentiated from PMBCL and cases with overlapped features have been described as mediastinal gray zone lymphoma. Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma carries a favorable prognosis in comparison to conventional DLBCL.	2011	05	03	Arch Pathol Lab Med	Hutchinson	Charles Blake
21429398		[Preliminary study of gene expression profile associated with risk classification of childhood patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia].	To explore genes associated with risk classification of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by gene chip technology. Group A and B were both composed of three newly diagnosed ALL cases with standard risk. After re-evaluation, group B was relegated to high-risk. The control group was composed of three idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. The gene expression profiles of group A and B were studied by Illumina Human-6 Beadchip. Eighty-two ALL patients were selected as the experimental group and 21 with normal bone marrow as control group for real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR). (1) There were 19 genes expressed differently between group B and A, including 14 up-regulated as ABCC4 and BCL11A, 5 down-regulated genes as TOP2A. (2) ABCC4 and BCL11A were validated by RQ-PCR and their expression level was higher in the high risk group than in the standard risk group (P &lt; 0.05). The gene expression level in the group A and B was higher than that in the normal control group (P &lt; 0.01). TOP2A was also validated by RQ-PCR and its expression level in the high risk group was lower than that in the standard risk group (P &lt; 0.05). The gene expression level in the groups A and B was lower than that in the normal control group and the difference was statistically significance (P &lt; 0.01). (3) There was a significant difference in the expression level of ABCC4 between the remission and unremission patients (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression level of BCL11A between different clinical indicators (P &gt; 0.05). There was significant difference in the expression level of TOP2A between remission and prednisone good responder groups (P &lt; 0.05). Fourteen genes studied were involved in the pathogenesis and drug resistance mechanism in childhood ALL patients. Investigation of gene expression profile will be helpful for predicting drug resistance, prognosis, early intervention and target therapy in childhood ALL.	2012	05	17	Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Wang	Jun-lin
21772954	10.4081/pr.2011.e17	Recent advances in β-thalassemias.	β-thalassemias are heterogeneous hereditary anemias characterized by a reduced output of β-globin chains. The disease is most frequent in the temperate regions of the world, where it represents an important health problem. In the last decades, several programs, aimed at controlling the birth rate of thalassemia newborns by screening and prenatal diagnosis of populations with high risk of β-thalassemia, have been successful accomplished. Bone marrow transplantation has offered a definitive cure for the fraction of patients with available donors. In the same time, steady improvements were made in the traditional clinical management of β-thalassemia patients. The introduction of the oral iron chelators deferiprone that preferentially chelates hearth iron and the development of novel NMR diagnostic methods has led to reduced morbility, increased survival and improved quality of life. More recently, major advances have being made in the discovery of critical modifier genes, such as Myb and especially BCL11A (B cell lymphoma 11A), a master regulator of HbF (fetal hemoglobin) and hemoglobin switching. Polimorphysms of BCL11A, Myb and γ-globin genes account for most of the variability in the clinical phenotypes in β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia patients. Finally, the year 2010 has brought in the first successful experiment of gene therapy in a β-thalassemia patient, opening up the perspective of a generalized cure for all β- thalassemia patients.	2011	11	10	Pediatr Rep	Cao	Antonio
21822207	10.1038/modpathol.2011.116	Gray zone lymphoma: chromosomal aberrations with immunophenotypic and clinical correlations.	The term gray zone lymphoma has been applied to tumors that demonstrate transitional morphologic and immunophenotypic features between classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, especially primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Histopathological and genetic data are limited for these unusual cases. We analyzed cases of gray zone lymphoma (n=27), mediastinal composite lymphoma (n=3) and mediastinal synchronous/metachronous lymphoma (n=3) by morphology, immunophenotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Mediastinal involvement was assured in 24/33 patients (73%). The patient cohort showed a male predominance (M:F ratio; 20:13) and a median age of 32 years (range, 16-91 years). Patients with mediastinal disease were significantly younger (median age: 29.5 years) than patients presenting without evident mediastinal disease (median age: 55 years). Gains including amplifications in 2p16.1 (REL/BCL11A locus) were observed in 33% of all patients, whereas alterations affecting the JAK2/PDL2 locus in 9p24.1 were present in 55%. Further studies revealed rearrangement of the CIITA locus at 16p13.13 in 8/30 cases (27%) and 7/26 cases (27%) demonstrated gains of 8q24 (MYC). Genetic aberrations involving 2p16.1, 9p24.1 and 8q24 showed a higher incidence in cases with evident mediastinal involvement. However, this was not statistically significant when compared with cases without known mediastinal involvement. Twelve of the 27 cases of gray zone lymphoma were morphologically more reminiscent of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, whereas the other gray zone lymphomas presented with morphological features more closely resembling large B-cell lymphoma. Both morphological groups of gray zone lymphoma were similarly positive for Cyclin E (75 and 93%) and p63 (50 and 53%, respectively) expression. These findings further support a close relationship between gray zone lymphoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and suggest that some cases of gray zone lymphoma without mediastinal disease may share similar genetic alterations.	2012	03	28	Mod Pathol	Eberle	Franziska C
20534004	10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06852.x	Bcl11A/CTIP1 mediates the effect of the glutamate receptor on axon branching and dendrite outgrowth.	While neuronal activity regulates neurite outgrowth and branching, the details of the underlying mechanisms are still largely unclear. This study investigated the effect of the glutamate receptors on neuritogenesis using cultured hippocampal neurons. At 3-4 days in vitro, NMDA treatment promoted axon branching but not primary axon extension. In contrast, blockade of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) by AP5 treatment enhanced primary axon extension. NMDAR activation also increased dendrite number and total dendrite length. These results suggest that NMDAR controls axon and dendrite morphogenesis. A previous study demonstrated that knockdown of the zinc finger transcription factor B cell lymphoma 11A-long (Bcl11A-L) reduces deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1b expression, thereby promoting axon branching. Here, glutamate stimulation down-regulated the levels of the Bcl11A-L, DCC, MAP1b, and MAP2c proteins. Over-expression of either Bcl11A-L or DCC countered the effect of NMDA or glutamate on axon branching and dendrite outgrowth, indicating that the Bcl11A-L/DCC pathway is an important downstream effector of glutamate receptors in neurite arborization. Because knockdown of Bcl11A-L did not down-regulate MAP2c, our results suggest that glutamate receptors also use a Bcl11A-L-independent pathway to control dendrite outgrowth. To summarize, this study reveals novel pathways downstream of glutamate receptors that regulate axon and dendrite arborization.	2010	09	13	J Neurochem	Kuo	Ting-Yu
20578197	10.1002/ajh.21758	14q32/miRNA clusters loss of heterozygosity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with up-regulation of BCL11a.	This study evaluated the loss and expression level of miRNAs 14q32 clusters in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with cryptic deletions at 14q32 chromosomal band to investigate their involvement in this disease. We demonstrate that a subset of ALL cases bearing 14q32 LOH showed a down-regulation of miRNA 14q32 clusters, which is directly linked to the submicroscopic chromosomal deletion. As a consequence of miRNAs deregulation we reported an inverse correlation with the expression of their target BCL11a, a transcription factor involved in lymphoid differentiation. These results suggest that 14q32/miRNA clusters LOH may be another mechanism involved in lymphoid B cell transformation and differentiation and therefore, could be used as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in subsets of ALL.	2010	08	11	Am J Hematol	Agueli	Cecilia
20623620	10.1002/jnr.22407	X-linked mental retardation gene CASK interacts with Bcl11A/CTIP1 and regulates axon branching and outgrowth.	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine kinase (CASK), a causative gene in X-linked mental retardation, carries out multiple functions in neurons, including vesicle trafficking of ion channels, synapse formation, and gene transcription. From a yeast two-hybrid screen, Krüppel-like zinc finger protein B cell lymphoma/COUP-TF-interacting protein 1 (Bcl11A/CTIP1) was identified as a CASK binding protein. Through alternative splicing, a single Bcl11A gene encodes two major protein products in neurons, Bcl11A-S and Bcl11A-L. CASK interacted with both Bcl11A-S and Bcl11A-L in transfected COS cells and brain. Immunofluorescence staining further indicated the colocalization of CASK and Bcl11A in the nuclei of neurons. These studies supported an interaction between CASK and Bcl11A in vivo. Bcl11A-L has previously been shown to play a role in gene transcription as well as axon outgrowth and branching. Here, we further show that Bcl11A-L rearranges the distribution of nuclear actin, which may be related to the function of Bcl11A-L in gene expression. More importantly, using cultured hippocampal neurons as a model system, we show that CASK enhances the ability of Bcl11A-L to restrict axon outgrowth and branching. Interruption of the interaction between CASK and Bcl11A increased the outgrowth and branching of axons, suggesting that the interaction between CASK and Bcl11A controls axon arborization. In conclusion, our results suggest that, through the interaction with Bcl11A, CASK plays a role in axonogenesis, which may be related to brain anatomical characteristics in humans.	2010	10	20	J Neurosci Res	Kuo	Ting-Yu
19096012	10.1182/blood-2008-07-168096	Molecular profiling of classical Hodgkin lymphoma tissues uncovers variations in the tumor microenvironment and correlations with EBV infection and outcome.	The outcome of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients may be related to the tumor microenvironment, which in turn may be influenced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To characterize the cHL microenvironment, a set of 63 cHL tissue samples was profiled using DNA microarrays. Their gene expression profile differed from that of histiocyte T cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (H/TCRBCL) samples that were used as controls, mainly due to high expression of PDCD1/PD-1 in H/TCRBCL. EBV(+) cHL tissues could be distinguished from EBV(-) samples by a gene signature characteristic of Th1 and antiviral responses. Samples from cHL patients with favorable outcome overexpressed genes specific for B cells and genes involved in apoptotic pathways. An independent set of 146 cHL samples was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. It showed a significant adverse value in case of high percentage of either TIA-1(+)-reactive cells or topoisomerase-2(+) tumor cells, whereas high numbers of BCL11A(+), FOXP3(+), or CD20(+) reactive cells had a favorable influence. Our results suggest an antitumoral role for B cells in the cHL microenvironment and a stronger stromal influence of the PD1 pathway in H/TCRBCL than cHL. The observation of Th1/ antiviral response in EBV(+) cHL tissues provides a basis for novel treatment strategies.	2009	04	28	Blood	Chetaille	Bruno
19369625	10.1309/AJCPXLY46UPFLISC	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia With t(2;14)(p16;q32) involves the BCL11A and IgH genes and is associated with atypical morphologic features and unmutated IgVH genes.	The t(2;14)(p16;q32) has been reported previously in only 12 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The clinicopathologic features have been incompletely described. We describe 6 new cases of CLL/SLL with t(2;14)(p16;q32). All had marrow involvement, 4 had absolute lymphocytosis, 4 had lymphadenopathy, and 3 had hepatosplenomegaly. All showed atypical lymphocyte morphologic features with plasmacytoid differentiation and irregular nuclei; 3 had increased prolymphocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated typical immunophenotypes in 5 and an atypical immunophenotype in 1. All expressed ZAP70; 5 assessed showed unmutated IgV(H) genes. Karyotyping identified t(2;14)(p16;q32) as the sole abnormality in 1, primary abnormality in 2, and part of a complex karyotype in 3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed BCL11A/IgH rearrangement in all. After chemotherapy, 3 patients died of disease and 3 were alive with disease (median follow-up, 80 months). We conclude that CLL/SLL with t(2;14) (p16;q32) and BCL11A/IgH rearrangement is characterized by atypical morphologic features and unmutated IgV(H) genes.	2009	04	28	Am J Clin Pathol	Yin	C Cameron
18367492	10.3324/haematol.12221	Comparative genome profiling across subtypes of low-grade B-cell lymphoma identifies type-specific and common aberrations that target genes with a role in B-cell neoplasia.	Low-grade B-cell lymphomas are a very heterogeneous group of tumors, whose differential diagnosis is frequently compromised by the lack of specific cytogenetic or molecular features. Our objective was to search for genomic features that allow a better molecular identification of the different types of lymphoma studied. We selected a panel of 87 low-grade B-cell lymphoma tumor samples that were unambiguously diagnosed (clinically and cytogenetically) as: follicular, splenic marginal zone, nodal marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, mantle cell, extranodal marginal zone MALT-type lymphoma or B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All samples were subjected to the same high-resolution genomic DNA analysis (array-based comparative genomic hybridization): a whole genome platform that contained 44000 probes distributed across the genome. Genomic imbalances were recorded, compiled and analyzed. Eighty percent of analyzed cases showed genomic imbalances (deletions and gain/amplifications) but the frequency of these imbalances ranged from 100% in mantle cell lymphomas to 33% in MALT lymphomas. A total of 95 new genomic imbalances affecting all lymphoma subtypes, were defined. We evaluated the extension of the genomic instability, detecting distinct patterns of genomic instability within subtypes. Specific pathways, such as nuclear factor kB (gains of REL and BCL11A, and losses of COMMD3, BIRC1, IKK1 and NFKB2), Polycomb group proteins (gain of BMI1 and deletion of PCGF6), DNA repair checkpoint pathways (deletion of 16q24 involving CDT1), or miRNA with a role in B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis (MIRN15A, MIRN16-1), were targeted by this genomic instability. Although all subtypes of lymphomas showed gains and losses of DNA, the analysis of their genomic profiles indicated that there are specific aberrations in almost every subtype as well as frequent aberrations that are common to a large number of lymphoma types. These common aberrations target genes that are important in B-cell lymphomagenesis.	2008	09	24	Haematologica	Ferreira	Bibiana I
18940474	10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.06.007	BCL2 and BCL3 are recurrent translocation partners of the IGH locus.	Chromosomal translocations affecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus in chromosomal band 14q32 are the most frequent cytogenetic changes in B-cell lymphomas. We studied the presence of IGH translocations in a consecutively ascertained series of 94 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHL) by combined immunofluorescence for CD30 and interphase cytogenetics (FICTION technique). The Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of a total of 11 of 87 evaluable cases (13%) showed signal patterns indicative of IGH translocations. To identify the translocation partners, these cases were further studied with probes for the MYC, BCL2, BCL6, BCL3, REL/BCL11A, JAK2/PDCD1LG2 (alias PDL2) C14orf43, and C2TA loci. The IGH translocation partner could be identified in four cHL and involved BCL2 and BCL3 in two cases each. Immunohistochemistry in cases with suitable material revealed that tumor cells of the two cHL with IGH/BCL2 fusion and the cHL with IGH/BCL3 fusion expressed the BCL2 and BCL3 protein, respectively. These data indicate that BCL2 or BCL3 are recurrent translocation partners of the IGH locus in cHL; however, most of the translocation partners of IGH translocations in cHL remain to be identified.	2008	11	04	Cancer Genet Cytogenet	Szymanowska	Natalia
17230227	10.1038/sj.leu.2404529	Mapping of MYC breakpoints in 8q24 rearrangements involving non-immunoglobulin partners in B-cell lymphomas.	Chromosomal translocations joining the immunoglobulin (IG) and MYC genes have been extensively reported in Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's lymphomas but data concerning MYC rearrangements with non-IG partners are scarce. In this study, 8q24 breakpoints from 17 B-cell lymphomas involving non-IG loci were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In seven cases the breakpoint was inside a small region encompassing MYC: in one t(7;8)(p12;q24) and two t(3;8)(q27;q24), it was telomeric to MYC whereas in four cases, one t(2;8)(p15;q24) and three t(8;9)(q24;p13) it was located in a 85 kb region encompassing MYC. In these seven cases, partner regions identified by FISH contained genes known to be involved in lymphomagenesis, namely BCL6, BCL11A, PAX5 and IKAROS. Breakpoints were cloned in two t(8;9)(q24;p13), 2.5 and 7 kb downstream from MYC and several hundred kb 5' to PAX5 on chromosome 9, joining MYC to ZCCHC7 and to ZBTB5 exon 2, two genes encoding zinc-finger proteins. In these seven cases, MYC expression measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was significantly higher when compared to that of patients without 8q24 rearrangement (P=0.006). These results suggest that these rearrangements are the consequence of a non-random process targeting MYC together with non-IG genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation and lymphoma progression.	2007	04	13	Leukemia	Bertrand	P
17638669	10.1309/21TN2RUWKR827UW2	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia FISH panel: impact on diagnosis.	Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an alternative to conventional chromosome analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We analyzed 172 samples from 136 possible CLL cases using a FISH panel. Reflex testing with probes to CCND1, BCL2, BCL3, BCL11A, c-MYC, MALT1, and a break-apart immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) probe was done if more than 2 signals for 14q32 occurred. For 111 cases, there were sufficient data for analysis. Of 111 cases, 81 (72.9%) had 1 or more genetic abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality was 13q-, followed by trisomy 12, 11q-, and 17p-. In 13 cases, there were IGH abnormalities. Two cases with CCND1/IGH fusion were reclassified as mantle cell lymphoma. Four CLL cases had IGH fusion with BCL2, BCL3 (2 cases), and BCL11A; no fusion partner was detected in 7 cases. Morphologic features were atypical for CLL in 2 cases with IGH fusion (BCL11A and BCL3). The FISH CLL panel is useful to identify prognostic aberrations and to clarify diagnosis in cases with unusual morphologic features.	2007	08	23	Am J Clin Pathol	Nelson	Beverly P
18253030	10.1159/000112062	U-HO1, a new cell line derived from a primary refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.	The Hodgkin cell line U-HO1 was established from a malignant pleural effusion of a 23-year-old male patient during the end stage of refractory nodular sclerosing classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Since its establishment in 2005, U-HO1 has maintained stable characteristics in vitro and has a doubling time of about 4 days under standard culture conditions. U-HO1 forms typical Reed-Sternberg cells in suspension, is EBV negative, lacks HLA-A, -B, -C but expresses HLA-D proteins/CD74 and exposes CD15 together with CD30 in the absence of CD19 and CD20 on the cell surface. Karyotype analysis of U-HO1 revealed a hyperdiploid karyotype with multiple clonal aberrations. Most significant is an elongated chromosome 2, der(2)t(2;10)(q35; q16.1)add(2)(p13). CGH analysis revealed the following imbalances: ish cgh dim(1)(p13p31)(p12q21), enh(2)(p13p23), dim(4)(q31.3qter), enh(6)(q22q27), enh(12), enh(18), enh(20) (q13.1pter). FISH analysis showed about six-fold amplification of REL and BCL11A, thus, U-HO1 is prototypical for cHL in every aspect tested so far. As an outstanding feature compared to the existing HL cell lines, U-HO1 has high levels of microRNA transcripts of MIRN216 and MIRN217 located in the amplicon 2p16. Compared to other HL cell lines, U-HO1 proved far less genetically aberrant suggesting that U-HO1's imbalances suffice to cause the full-blown phenotype of primary refractory cHL.	2008	02	21	Cytogenet Genome Res	Mader	A
16704730	10.1186/1476-4598-5-18	Functional studies of BCL11A: characterization of the conserved BCL11A-XL splice variant and its interaction with BCL6 in nuclear paraspeckles of germinal center B cells.	Chromosomal aberrations of BCL11A at 2p16.1 have been reported in a variety of B-cell malignancies and its deficiency in mice leads to a profound block in B-cell development. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of BCL11A produces multiple isoforms sharing a common N-terminus. The most abundant isoform we have identified in human lymphoid samples is BCL11A-XL, the longest transcript produced at this locus, and here we report the conservation of this major isoform and its functional characterization. We show that BCL11A-XL is a DNA-sequence-specific transcriptional repressor that associates with itself and with other BCL11A isoforms, as well as with the BCL6 proto-oncogene. Western blot data for BCL11A-XL expression coupled with data previously published for BCL6 indicates that these genes are expressed abundantly in germinal-center-derived B cells but that expression is extinguished upon terminal differentiation to the plasma cell stage. Although BCL11A-XL/BCL6 interaction can modulate BCL6 DNA binding in vitro, their heteromeric association does not alter the homomeric transcriptional properties of either on model reporter activity. BCL11A-XL partitions into the nuclear matrix and colocalizes with BCL6 in nuclear paraspeckles. We propose that the conserved N-terminus of BCL11A defines a superfamily of C2HC zinc-finger transcription factors involved in hematopoietic malignancies.	2006	10	03	Mol Cancer	Liu	Hui
16734728	10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00209.x	Characterization of target genes at the 2p15-16 amplicon in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Amplification of 2p has been observed as a recurrent alteration in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Whereas two candidate oncogenes, REL and BCL11A, have been investigated as targets for 2p amplification, the question remains as to whether the true target gene in the amplicon is REL, BCL11A or both. We previously identified frequent genomic gains of chromosomal 2p in 25 out of 99 DLBCL cases by means of genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). All of these 25 cases included recurrent copy number gain at 2p15-16. In the study presented here, cases were analyzed in greater detail by means of contig bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array CGH for the 4.5-Mb region at 2p15-16, which contained 33 BAC clones. We confined the minimal common region to 500-kb in length, where only the candidate oncogene REL, and not BCL11A, is located. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to investigate the correlation between genomic gain and expression. It showed a significant correlation for both genes, indicating that these two genes are common targets for the 2p15-16 amplicon. However, given the fact that REL is more frequently amplified than BCL11A, the REL gene may play a more important role than BCL11A in the pathogenesis of DLBCL.	2006	07	13	Cancer Sci	Fukuhara	Noriko

16091750	10.1038/sj.onc.1208904	BCL11B functionally associates with the NuRD complex in T lymphocytes to repress targeted promoter.	BCL11 genes play crucial roles in lymphopoiesis and have been associated with hematopoietic malignancies. Specifically, disruption of the BCL11B (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11B) locus is linked to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the loss of heterozygosity in mice results in T-cell lymphoma. BCL11 proteins are related C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors that act as transcriptional repressors. Here, we demonstrate the association of the endogenous BCL11B with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, one of the major transcriptional corepressor complexes in mammalian cells. BCL11B complexes from T lymphocytes possess trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylase activity, confirming the functionality of the complexes. Analysis of the BCL11B-NuRD association demonstrated that BCL11B directly interacted with the metastasis-associated proteins MTA1 and MTA2 through the amino-terminal region. We provide evidence for the functional requirement of MTA1 in transcriptional repression mediated by BCL11B through the following: (1) overexpression of MTA1 enhanced the transcriptional repression mediated by BCL11B, (2) knockdown of MTA1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited BCL11B transcriptional repression activity and (3) MTA1 was specifically recruited to a BCL11B targeted promoter. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the NuRD complex mediates transcriptional repression function of BCL11B.	2005	11	29	Oncogene	Cismasiu	Valeriu B
16147992	10.1074/mcp.M500112-MCP200	Analysis of BCL6-interacting proteins by tandem mass spectrometry.	B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a 95-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein and member of the Pox virus zinc finger/bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex (POZ/BTB) family of transcription factors. BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for germinal center formation, and the gene encoding it is frequently altered in diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphomas. The dysregulation of BCL6 has therefore been implicated in lymphomagenesis. A limited number of proteins is known to interact with BCL6 and modulate its activity or participate in its role in transcriptional regulation. Identification of additional BCL6-binding proteins could reveal potential signaling targets and previously undescribed functional roles for BCL6. We used a functional proteomic approach to determine the identity of proteins that interact with BCL6. Proteins were isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-BCL6 antibody and identified using MS/MS. We identified 61 proteins in the BCL6 immunocomplex from the following Gene Ontology categories: transcription regulator activity (n = 18), binding activity (n = 11), signal transducer activity (n = 10), catalytic activity (n = 8), structural molecule activity (n = 3), enzyme regulator activity (n = 3), transporter activity (n = 2), motor activity (n = 2), chaperone activity (n = 1), and unknown function (n = 3). Importantly we identified BCL6 and several previously reported BCL6-interacting proteins in the BCL6 immunocomplex. The remaining proteins have not been shown previously to be associated with BCL6. MS/MS results were validated on four proteins using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Two of these protein interactions were further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. This study demonstrates the utility of antibody immunoprecipitation and subsequent peptide identification by MS/MS for the elucidation of BCL6-binding proteins. Many of the novel proteins identified in this study suggest additional functional roles for BCL6 beyond transcriptional repression.	2006	03	28	Mol Cell Proteomics	Miles	Rodney R
15241441	10.1038/labinvest.3700152	Epstein-Barr virus is integrated between REL and BCL-11A in American Burkitt lymphoma cell line (NAB-2).	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) initially isolated from the cultured Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells, is one of the well-known oncogenic virus. The NAB-2 line, which was established from a North American Burkitt's tumor, was indicated to contain one copy of EBV DNA as the integrated form into chromosome 2p13 of the host genome. To demonstrate the integration site of EBV directly, and to clarify the relation between the integration sites and the oncogenes, fragments containing the nucleotide sequence of NAB-2 integration sites were cloned. EBV was integrated via the terminal repeats (TR), and integration sites located in the clone RP11-440P5 on chromosome 2, between two oncogenes, REL and BCL11A, which is apart from approximately 350 kbp from each other. Expression level of REL in NAB-2 was increased. The flanking region of chromosome 2 at the bilateral junction sites showed no homology to the junction sites of EBV. The integration site 2p13 overlaps with common fragile site, FRA2E. NAB-2 cells expressed almost all latent genes but LMP-2A that flanks the TR, indicating the type III of latent infection of EBV. Integration event in NAB-2 might alter the regulation of the oncogenes and provide advantage for continuous cell proliferation.	2004	09	28	Lab Invest	Luo	Wen-Juan
15313894	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1253	Aberrant expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA4 and the transcription factor twist in Sézary syndrome identified by gene expression analysis.	Sézary syndrome (Sz) is a malignancy of CD4+ memory skin-homing T cells and presents with erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral blood involvement. To gain more insight into the molecular features of Sz, oligonucleotide array analysis was performed comparing gene expression patterns of CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood of patients with Sz with those of patients with erythroderma secondary to dermatitis and healthy controls. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering gene, expression patterns of T cells from patients with Sz were classified separately from those of benign T cells. One hundred twenty-three genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed and had an average fold change exceeding 2. T cells from patients with Sz demonstrated decreased expression of the following hematopoietic malignancy-linked tumor suppressor genes: TGF-beta receptor II, Mxi1, Riz1, CREB-binding protein, BCL11a, STAT4, and Forkhead Box O1A. Moreover, the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA4 and the potentially oncogenic transcription factor Twist were highly and selectively expressed in T cells of patients with Sz. High expression of EphA4 and Twist was also observed in lesional skin biopsy specimens of a subset of patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas related to Sz, whereas their expression was nearly undetectable in benign T cells or in skin lesions of patients with inflammatory dermatoses. Detection of EphA4 and Twist may be used in the molecular diagnosis of Sz and related cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, the membrane-bound EphA4 receptor may serve as a target for directed therapeutic intervention.	2004	09	30	Cancer Res	van Doorn	Remco
15337798	10.1200/JCO.2004.11.025	Clinicopathologic significance and prognostic value of chromosomal imbalances in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	To determine the clinicopathologic significance and prognostic value of chromosomal imbalances in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). We have examined 64 tumors at diagnosis using comparative genomic hybridization and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-stranded conformational polymorphism, and DNA sequencing for the analysis of several potential target genes. The most recurrent alterations were gains of 18q (20%), Xq (15%), 2p, 7q, and 12p (14%), and losses of 6q and 17p (14%). Frequent high-level DNA amplifications were detected at 2p13-p16 and 18q21 loci. Real-time quantitative PCR detected REL and BCL11A gene amplifications in the nine patients with gains at 2p13-p16 and only in one additional patient with normal chromosome 2. Similarly, the BCL-2 gene was amplified in the 12 tumors with gains of 18q21 but in none of 39 patients with normal 18q profile. p53 gene inactivation was detected in nine of 58 (16%) tumors and was commonly associated with 17p losses. Tumors with 18q gains were significantly associated with a high number of chromosomal imbalances, primary nodal presentation, high serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, high International Prognostic Index, shorter cause-specific survival, and a high risk of relapse. Losses of 17p and p53 gene alterations were associated with an absence of complete response achievement. These results suggest that DLBCLs have a characteristic pattern of genomic alterations; 18q gains or amplifications and 17p losses are associated with particular clinicopathological features and aggressive clinical behavior. Additional studies are needed to confirm these observations in larger series of patients.	2004	09	17	J Clin Oncol	Beà	Sílvia
15496980	10.1038/sj.leu.2403500	Rapid amplification of immunoglobulin heavy chain switch (IGHS) translocation breakpoints using long-distance inverse PCR.	Molecular cloning of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) translocation breakpoints identifies genes of biological importance in the development of normal and malignant B cells. Long-distance inverse PCR (LDI-PCR) was first applied to amplification of IGH gene translocations targeted to the joining (IGHJ) regions. We report here successful amplification of the breakpoint of IGH translocations targeted to switch (IGHS) regions by LDI-PCR. To detect IGHS translocations, Southern blot assays using 5' and 3' switch probes were performed. Illegitimate Smu rearrangements were amplified from the 5' end (5'Smu LDI-PCR) from the alternative derivative chromosome, and those of Sgamma or Salpha were amplified from the 3' end (3'Sgamma or 3'alpha LDI-PCR) from the derivative chromosome 14. Using a combination of these methods, we have succeeded in amplifying IGHS translocation breakpoints involving FGFR3/MMSET on 4p16, BCL6 on 3q27, MYC on 8q24, IRTA1 on 1q21 and PAX5 on 9p13 as well as BCL11A on 2p13 and CCND3 on 6p21. The combination of LDI-PCR for IGHJ and IGHS allows rapid molecular cloning of almost all IGH gene translocation breakpoints.	2004	12	21	Leukemia	Sonoki	T
12406872	10.1182/blood-2002-07-2119	Transformation of follicular lymphoma to diffuse large cell lymphoma is associated with a heterogeneous set of DNA copy number and gene expression alterations.	Genomic aberrations in a series of paired biopsy samples from patients who presented initially with follicle center lymphoma (FCL) and subsequently transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were measured by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The consequences of these aberrations on gene expression were determined by comparison with expression analysis on these specimens using cDNA microarrays. A heterogeneous pattern of acquired genomic abnormalities was observed upon transformation, some of which were recurrent in small subsets of patients. Some of the genomic aberration acquired upon transformation, such as gain/amplification of 1q21-q24, 2p16 (REL/BCL11A gene loci), 3q27-q29 (including the BCL6 locus), 7q11.2-q22.1, 12pter-q12, 18q21 (including the BCL2 locus) and Xq, and deletion of 6q22-q24, 13q14-q21 and 17p13 (P53 locus) have been previously implicated in the FCL/DLBCL pathogenesis. In addition, novel genomic imbalances not previously reported in association with FCL transformation, such as overrepresentation of 4p12-pter, 5p12-p15, 6p12.3-p21, 9p23, 9q13-q31, 16q, 17q21, and loss of 1p36.3, 4q21-q23, 5q21-q23, 9q31-qter, 11q24-q25, and 15q23, were identified. We observed a differential expression profile of many genes within regions of gain and deletion upon transformation, including novel target genes associated with FCL transformation. However, other genes did not show deregulated expression despite their location within these areas. In summary, the combination of array CGH and expression analysis provides a more comprehensive picture of the transformation of FCL to DLBCL. This process is associated with the acquisition of a variable spectrum of genomic imbalances affecting recurrent chromosomal areas that harbor overexpressed or underexpressed genes targeted upon transformation.	2003	06	18	Blood	Martinez-Climent	Jose A
12774917	10.1007/BF02982637	The pathogenetic role of oncogenes deregulated by chromosomal translocation in B-cell malignancies.	Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin (IG) loci play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of many subtypes of mature B-cell malignancy. Although all the common IG translocations have been cloned, cloning of rare but nonetheless recurrent translocations continues to allow identification of genes of importance to the development of both normal and malignant B-cells. Clustering of breakpoints within the IG gene segments has allowed development of polymerase chain reaction methods that facilitate cloning. IG translocations result in overexpression of a wide variety of genes ranging from cell surface receptors to transcriptional repressors. Genes recently shown to be involved in such translocations include BCL11A and MALT1. As with the acute leukemias, different translocations in B-cell lymphomas may target different proteins that interact directly. A common endpoint for several translocations is activation of the nuclear factor kappaB pathway. Analysis of the mechanisms of transformation may define new therapeutic strategies.	2003	10	23	Int J Hematol	Dyer	Martin J S
11830502	10.1182/blood.v99.4.1474	Recurrent involvement of the REL and BCL11A loci in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.	Comparative genomic hybridization studies have shown gains in chromosome region 2p as the most common imbalance in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). The minimal region of gain contained 2 candidate oncogenes, REL and BCL11A. This study examined the involvement of REL and BCL11A loci in 44 primary cases of cHL by combined immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics (FICTION). A median 2p13 copy number above the tetraploid range was detected in 24 (55%) cases. Adjustment for centromere 2 copy number indicated gains of 2p13 in 11 of 31 cHLs (35%) with 8 (26%) high-level amplifications. One cHL displayed selective amplification of the REL locus not affecting BCL11A; another case studied by FICTION and a cHL with cytogenetic 2p change investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization showed signal patterns suggesting breakpoints in the region spanned by the REL probe. These data indicate that REL rather than BCL11A may be the target of the 2p13 alterations in cHL.	2002	04	25	Blood	Martín-Subero	José I
11986957	10.1038/sj.leu.2402480	Lack of somatic hypermutation of IG V(H) genes in lymphoid malignancies with t(2;14)(p13;q32) translocation involving the BCL11A gene.	The t(2;14)(p13;q32.3) involving the BCL11A and IGH genes is a rare but recurrent chromosomal aberration in B-cell malignancies. Hitherto, juxtaposition of BCL11A and IGH has only been described in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and immunocytoma. As subgroups of B-CLL can be distinguished by the pattern of somatic mutation of immunoglobulin variable (V) genes we investigated four lymphomas with IGH/BCL11A involvement for IGH hypermutation. Clonal V(H) gene rearrangements were amplified; in all four cases, sequencing of the amplificates revealed the rearranged V(H) genes to lack somatic mutations. These results suggest that t(2;14)(p13;q32.3) is associated with a subset of B-CLL/immunocytoma characterized by non-mutated IG genes deriving from pre-germinal center B cells. As the translocations in both informative cases are targeted to the switch regions of the IGG2 gene, which is mainly used in T cell-independent immune responses, these translocations presumably occurred in activated B cells in the course of T cell-independent immune responses outside the germinal center.	2002	06	18	Leukemia	Küppers	R

However, immunoglobulin V(H) gene segment mutation analysis has provided insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and allowed the development of powerful prognostic markers. Immunoglobulin gene chromosomal translocations are rare in CLL and involve a distinct subset of genes including BCL3, BCL11A and CCND2. BCL2 translocations in CLL appear to arise via a different mechanism from comparable translocations seen in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	2002	06	24	Leukemia	Dyer	M J S
11719382	10.1182/blood.v98.12.3413	The BCL11 gene family: involvement of BCL11A in lymphoid malignancies.	Many malignancies of mature B cells are characterized by chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus on chromosome 14q32.3 and result in deregulated expression of the translocated oncogene. t(2;14)(p13;q32.3) is a rare event in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, gains and amplifications of the same region of chromosome 2p13 have been reported in 20% of extranodal B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL), in follicular and mediastinal B-NHL, and in Hodgkin disease (HD). It has been suggested that REL, an NF-kappaB gene family member, mapping within the amplified region, is the pathologic target. However, by molecular cloning of t(2;14)(p13;q32.3) from 3 cases of aggressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/immunocytoma, this study has shown clustered breakpoints on chromosome 2p13 immediately upstream of a CpG island located about 300 kb telomeric of REL. This CpG island was associated with a Krüppel zinc finger gene (BCL11A), which is normally expressed at high levels only in fetal brain and in germinal center B-cells. There were 3 major RNA isoforms of BCL11A, differing in the number of carboxy-terminal zinc fingers. All 3 RNA isoforms were deregulated as a consequence of t(2;14)(p13;q32.3). BCL11A was highly conserved, being 95% identical to mouse, chicken, and Xenopus homologues. BCL11A was also highly homologous to another gene (BCL11B) on chromosome 14q32.1. BCL11A coamplified with REL in B-NHL cases and HD lymphoma cell lines with gains and amplifications of 2p13, suggesting that BCL11A may be involved in lymphoid malignancies through either chromosomal translocation or amplification.	2001	12	20	Blood	Satterwhite	E
34060394	10.1080/01635581.2021.1931700	Britannin a Sesquiterpene Lactone from <i>Inula aucheriana</i> Exerted an Anti-leukemic Effect in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Cells and Enhanced the Sensitivity of the Cells to Vincristine.	Since chemotherapy drugs have dose-related side effects, there is still a need for finding new agents with suitable cytotoxic effects without any harmful effects. For this purpose, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects of Britannin that is a Sesquiterpene Lactone compound <i>Inula aucheriana</i>, alone or in combination with Vincristine (VCR), on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)-derived MOLT-4 cells. In this study, we found that Britannin decreased the viability of MOLT-4 cells with the IC50 Values of 2 µM, but had no cytotoxic effects on normal cells or Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). Our results also showed that Britannin decreased the proliferation of MOLT-4 cells by preventing the transition of the cells from the S phase of the cell cycle through the up-regulation of p21 and p27. Moreover, this agent induced ROS-mediated apoptosis by altering the expression of Bax, Bim, Caspase3, Bcl2, and XIAP. Britannin also produced a synergistic effect with Vincristine in MOLT-4 cells. Taken together, the results of this study showed for the first time that Britannin, as a natural Sesquiterpene Lactone, has cytotoxic effects that could be considered as an anti-leukemic agent in the treatment of ALL. However, there is still a demand for further studies that examine the efficacy and the safety of this purified compound.	2022	04	13	Nutr Cancer	Mohammadlou	Hassan
34082607	10.1177/11206721211023309	Follicular lymphoma of the ocular adnexa: Clinicopathological findings with flow cytometry analysis of eight cases.	Flow cytometry (FCM) is used to evaluate cell surface markers of various leukocyte populations quantitatively. However, little is known about the usefulness of FCM in follicular lymphoma (FL) of the ocular adnexa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological features and FCM results in ocular adnexal FL. This is a retrospective multicenter case study on clinical and immunohistochemical features. All tumors, surgically excised, were diagnosed based on histopathology, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, and FCM. The percentages (%) of B-cell markers, T-cell markers, a natural killer cell marker, and cell surface kappa/lambda measured by FCM analysis in tumor tissues were searched based on medical records. This study enrolled nine tumors in eight FL patients (three men and five women). The median age at the time of initial presentation was 74 years. All the tumors surgically excised histologically exhibited cluster of differentiation (CD)10, CD20, and BCL2-positive cells. At the time of ophthalmic diagnosis, lymphomas were already disseminated throughout the body in five cases. FCM demonstrated high percentage of B-cell markers including CD10, CD19, CD20, and CD23 in all nine tumors. CD10 population was 73.5% ± 11.9% in seven out of nine tumors, while that in the other two tumors was particularly low being 11.7% ± 1.13%, which showed the relatively high T-cell lineages compared to the other seven tumors. For ophthalmologists involving managements of ocular adnexal tumors, FCM can provide useful information for complementing the diagnosis and understanding pathophysiology of FL.	2022	05	17	Eur J Ophthalmol	Mitamura	Mizuho
34180720	10.1177/10668969211027409	Aggressive Cyclin D1 Negative Blastoid Variant Mantle Cell Lymphoma-A Case Report.	A 68-year-old male presents with generalized lymphadenopathy and fever of short duration. Axillary lymph node excision was performed and was sent for histopathological evaluation. Microscopic evaluation of the submitted lymph node revealed diffuse proliferation of intermediate-sized atypical lymphoid cells with round nuclei, irregular membranes, finely dispersed chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures were frequently seen. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed diffuse expression of CD20, CD5, CD10, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6). Atypical lymphoid cells were negative for cyclin D1; however, showed diffuse and strong nuclear expression of SOX11. MIB1 proliferation index was high (Ki67: 90%-95%). Based on morphological features and immunohistochemical findings a diagnosis of ""cyclin D1 negative aggressive blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)"" was offered. The classic morphology of MCL is seen in 90% of cases, while the remaining (∼10%) are considered as variants. A blastoid variant is an aggressive subtype that can lack expression of CD5 as well as cyclin D1, but instead expresses CD10, Bcl6, and CD23. SOX11 expression is seen in 90% cases of MCL and in almost 100% cases of cyclin D1 negative MCL. The current case highlights the unusual morphologic and aggressive variant of MCL and a significant role of SOX11 in its diagnosis.	2022	03	08	Int J Surg Pathol	Loungani	Lavina

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia and has the lowest 5-year survival rates. Current treatment strategies do not meet the expectations also. Therefore, there is a need to improve therapeutic approaches still. Boron, which is a natural trace element in human diet, is gaining attention with its important roles in cellular processes for the development of new anti-cancer drug candidates. For instance, bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic acid, has encouraging results in the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. However, severe toxic effects and resistance development are the limitations to its application for AML treatment. Hence, the development of alternative boron-derived anti-AML agents is unmet need. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate anti-leukemic effect of two promising boron compounds, borax pentahydrate (BP) and disodium pentaborate decahydrate (DPD), and comparison of each other in terms of the capacity to trigger apoptosis on acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Apoptotic effects of the boron compounds on HL-60 cells were evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide dyes and caspase 3/7 activity assay by flow cytometry. In addition, Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved PARP levels were detected by western blotting. Although BP showed greater apoptosis-inducing capacity, we observed that both DPD (6 mM) and BP (24 mM) treatment showed anti-leukemic effect by triggering apoptotic pathway through increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio for the first time. Our study suggests that BP and DPD are the promising candidates for anti-AML drug development research, which may be confirmed by further wide-spectrum studies.	2022	02	21	Biol Trace Elem Res	Erkmen	Tuğba
34236820	10.21470/1678-9741-2020-0549	The Protective Effect of Kaempferol Against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Through Activating SIRT3 to Inhibit Oxidative Stress.	The objective of this study is to investigate the protective effect of kaempferol against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and the underlying molecular mechanisms. H9C2 cells were pretreated with kaempferol for 24 hours and further insulted with IR injury. Cell vitality, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, glutathione (GSH) level, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) expressions were evaluated. Moreover, short interfering ribonucleic acid targeting SIRT3 was used to investigate the role of SIRT3 against IR mediated by kaempferol in vitro. IR mice models were also established to confirm the protective effects of kaempferol on IR in vivo. After IR injury, H9C2 cells vitality was reduced, ROS levels, NADPH oxidase activity, and Bax expressions were increased, and GSH levels and Bcl2 expressions were decreased. After kaempferol pretreatment, the vitality of H9C2 cells was increased. The levels of ROS, NADPH oxidase activity, and Bax expression were decreased. In addition, levels of GSH and Bcl2 expression were enhanced. Furthermore, silencing SIRT3 attenuated the protective effect mediated by kaempferol, with increased ROS levels, NADPH oxidase activity, and Bax expression, along with reduced GSH level and Bcl2 expression. In vivo IR model showed that kaempferol could preserve IR-damaged cardiac function. Kaempferol has the capability of attenuating H9C2 cells IR injury through activating SIRT3 to inhibit oxidative stress.	2022	05	25	Braz J Cardiovasc Surg	Sun	Chuang
34289655	10.3324/haematol.2021.278638	Dose-adjusted EPOCH and rituximab for the treatment of double expressor and double-hit diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: impact of TP53 mutations on clinical outcome.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease, including one-third of cases overexpressing MYC and BCL2 proteins (double expressor lymphoma, DEL) and 5-10% of patients with chromosomal rearrangements of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL-6 (double/triple-hit lymphomas, DH/TH). TP53 mutations are detected in 20- 25% of DEL. We report the efficacy of dose-adjusted EPOCH and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) in a series of 122 consecutive patients, including DEL (n=81, 66%), DEL-MYC (n=9, 7%), DEL-BCL2 (n=13, 11%), or high-grade lymphomas (DH/TH) (n=19, 16%). Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis included intravenous methotrexate (n=66), intrathecal chemotherapy (IT) (n=40) or no prophylaxis (n=16). Sixty-seven patients (55%) had highintermediate or high International Prognostic Index (IPI) and 30 (25%) had high CNS-IPI. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire study population were 74% and 84%, respectively. There was a trend for inferior OS for DH/TH (2-year OS: 66%, P=0.058) as compared to all the others. The outcome was significantly better for the IPI 0-2 versus IPI 3-5 (OS: 98% vs. 72%, P=0.002). DA-EPOCH-R did not overcome the negative prognostic value of TP53 mutations: 2-year OS of 62% versus 88% (P=0.036) were observed for mutated as compared to wild-type cases, respectively. Systemic CNS prophylaxis conferred a better 2-year OS (94%) as compared to IT or no prophylaxis (76% and 65%, respectively; P=0.008). DA-EPOCH-R treatment resulted in a favorable outcome in patients with DEL and DEL with single rearrangement, whereas those with multiple genetic alterations such as DEL-DH/TH and TP53 mutated cases still have an inferior outcome.	2022	05	04	Haematologica	Dodero	Anna
34304248	10.1038/s41375-021-01347-6	Dual targeting of the DNA damage response pathway and BCL-2 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Standard chemotherapies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), based on the induction of exogenous DNA damage and oxidative stress, are often less effective in the presence of increased MYC and BCL-2 levels, especially in the case of double hit (DH) lymphomas harboring rearrangements of the MYC and BCL-2 oncogenes, which enrich for a patient's population characterized by refractoriness to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Here we hypothesized that adaptive mechanisms to MYC-induced replicative and oxidative stress, consisting in DNA damage response (DDR) activation and BCL-2 overexpression, could represent the biologic basis of the poor prognosis and chemoresistance observed in MYC/BCL-2-positive lymphoma. We first integrated targeted gene expression profiling (T-GEP), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and characterization of replicative and oxidative stress biomarkers in two independent DLBCL cohorts. The presence of oxidative DNA damage biomarkers identified a poor prognosis double expresser (DE)-DLBCL subset, characterized by relatively higher BCL-2 gene expression levels and enrichment for DH lymphomas. Based on these findings, we tested therapeutic strategies based on combined DDR and BCL-2 inhibition, confirming efficacy and synergistic interactions in in vitro and in vivo DH-DLBCL models. These data provide the rationale for precision-therapy strategies based on combined DDR and BCL-2 inhibition in DH or DE-DLBCL.	2022	02	18	Leukemia	Rossi	Alessandra

Fli-1 regulates multiple biological functions in different cancers particularly Ewing sarcoma and leukemias. There are controversial reports regarding function and prognostic significance of Fli-1 in epithelial cancer including gastric carcinoma (GC). No previous reports examined relationship between Fli-1 and BCL-2 in GC. This study aimed to investigate the expression of Fli-1 and BCL-2 in GC and expected the prognostic significance of their expression. Study was carried out on 88 gastric specimens (58 GC and 30 chronic gastritis cases). Immunohistochemical staining for Fli-1 and BCL-2 was done. There was significant lower Fli-1 and BCL-2 expression in GC than chronic gastritis. Advanced tumor stage showed significant relation with both low Fli-1 expression and negative BCL-2 expression. There was significant direct correlation between BCL-2 positivity and Fli-1 expression in GC. Cox-regression analysis showed that distant metastasis was the first independent factor affecting patients' OS. Fli-1 could act as tumor-suppressor protein involved in GC carcinogenesis. In addition, both Fli-1 and BCL-2 may be used as good prognostic markers in GC. The direct correlation between BCL-2 and Fli-1 expression could potentiate Fli-1 and BCL-2 as therapeutic targets in GC, acting together to inhibit cellular proliferation.	2022	03	16	J Immunoassay Immunochem	Hemida	Aiat Shaban
34332791	10.1016/j.pathol.2021.04.008	Morphologic and molecular analysis of Richter syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients treated with ibrutinib or venetoclax.	Richter syndrome (RS) represents the development of high-grade lymphoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with an adverse prognosis. The genetic background and morphology of RS in CLL patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy is extensively characterised; however, our knowledge about RS in patients treated with targeted oral therapies should be extended. To understand the morphologic and molecular changes leading to RS in CLL patients treated with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, and the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, sequential samples from six CLL/SLL patients undergoing RS were collected in both the CLL and RS phases. A detailed immunophenotypic analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of RS phase was performed, followed by extensive molecular characterisation of CLL and RS samples, including the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) rearrangement, TP53 mutations, drug-induced resistance mutations in BTK and BCL2 genes and various copy number changes and point mutations detectable with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Rare, non-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma phenotypes of RS were observed in 3/6 cases, including plasmablastic lymphoma and a transitory entity between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The majority of cases were clonally related and harboured an unmutated variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Abnormalities affecting the TP53 gene occurred in all patients, and every patient carried at least one genetic abnormality conferring susceptibility to RS. In the background of RS, 2/5 patients treated with ibrutinib showed a BTK C481S resistance mutation. One patient developed a BCL2 G101V mutation leading to venetoclax resistance and RS. In conclusion, our findings contribute to better understanding of RS pathogenesis in the era of targeted oral therapies. Rare phenotypic variants of RS do occur under the treatment of ibrutinib or venetoclax, and genetic factors leading to RS are similar to those identified in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. To our best knowledge, we have reported the first BCL2 G101V mutation in an RS patient treated with venetoclax.	2022	03	08	Pathology	Gángó	Ambrus
34353221	10.1080/15376516.2021.1965276	Concerted hepatoprotective effect of bradykinin potentiating factor and low dose of γ- radiation on <i>Naja haje</i> envenomed rats <i>via</i> Bax/Bcl2 pathway.	This study investigates the concerted hepatoprotective effects for three doses of bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) and/or followed by exposure to a low dose of γ-radiation (LDR) against <i>Naja haje</i> envenoming in rats. Male rats were injected with three consecutive doses of BPF (1 μg/g i.p. for 3 days), followed by exposure to a low dose of gamma radiation (0.5 Gy), and then rats were injected with a dose of <i>Naja haje</i> venom (250 μg/kg i.p.). Results showed that <i>Naja haje</i> causes liver damage, significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cytochrome c, Nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and significant depletion in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) contents. In addition, significant depletion in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and significant elevation in BcL-2 associated X (Bax protein), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in hepatocytes. Bradykinin potentiating factor and/or low dose of γ-radiation caused improvement in liver damage caused by <i>Naja haje</i> venom by a significant decrease in ALT, AST, ALP levels, Bax, cytochrome c, NF-κB, IL-1β, NO and MDA contents, BPF alone or combined with low dose radiation caused a significant increase in Bcl2 and GPx contents. In conclusion, the concerted impact of BPF and LDR may provide an effective venom detoxification tool that helps to reduce hepatic toxicity and extends the lifespan.	2021	12	08	Toxicol Mech Methods	Hasan	Hesham Farouk
34392269	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001750	Mutational Landscape of TdT+ Large B-cell Lymphomas Supports Their Distinction From B-lymphoblastic Neoplasms: A Multiparameter Study of a Rare and Aggressive Entity.	In the current World Health Organization classification, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression in a high grade/large cell B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) indicates a B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (B-LBL), although TdT expression in what appear to be mature LBCL or following mature B-cell neoplasms is reported. The frequency of TdT+ LBCL, how to best categorize these cases, and their clinicopathologic features, molecular landscape, and relationship to classic B-LBL remain to be better defined. TdT expression was therefore assessed in 258 LBCL and the results correlated with the cytologic, phenotypic, and cytogenetic findings. Targeted mutational analysis, review of prior biopsies, and assessment of clinical associations was performed in the 6 cases with &gt;10% TdT+ cells. All 6 TdT+ LBCL were blastoid-appearing, CD34-, MYC+, BCL2+, and had MYC rearrangements (R) (5/6 with BCL2 and/or BCL6-R). 5/6 had a prior TdT- LBCL and/or follicular lymphoma and all had an aggressive course. Fifteen nonsynonymous variants in 11 genes were seen in the 4/5 tested cases with mutations. TdT+ and TdT- areas in 1 case showed identical mutations. The mutational profiles were more like those reported in germinal center B-cell type-diffuse LBCL rather than B-LBL. Evolution from preceding TdT- lymphomas was nondivergent in 1/3 tested cases and partially divergent in 2. The clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features of these 6 cases were similar to those found in a meta-analysis that included additional cases of TdT+ LBCL or B-LBL following follicular lymphoma. Thus, TdT+, CD34- large B-cell neoplasms with MYC rearrangements and often a ""double hit"" are rare, frequently a transformational event and aggressive but are distinct from classic B-LBL.	2022	02	14	Am J Surg Pathol	Bhavsar	Shweta
34411492	10.1139/cjpp-2021-0007	Colchicine attenuates renal ischemia-reperfusion-induced liver damage: implication of TLR4/NF-κB, TGF-β, and <i>BAX</i> and <i>Bcl-2</i> gene expression.	Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is typically associated with a vigorous inflammatory and oxidative stress response to hypoxia and reperfusion that disturbs the function of the organ. The remote effects of renal IRI on the liver, however, require further study. Renal damage associated with liver disease is a common clinical problem. Colchicine, a polymerization inhibitor of microtubules, has been used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug for liver diseases. The goal of the current study was to investigate the possible protective mechanisms of colchicine on liver injury following renal IRI. Forty rats were divided randomly into four groups: sham group, colchicine-treated group, IRI group, and colchicine-treated + IRI group. Treatment with colchicine significantly reduced hepatic toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) contents; downregulated BCL2 associated X apoptosis regulator (<i>BAX</i>) gene expression, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) content, and upregulated hepatic B cell lymphoma 2 (<i>Bcl-2</i>) gene expression as compared with the IRI group. Finally, hepatic histopathological examinations have confirmed the biochemical results. Renal IRI-induced liver damage in rats was alleviated by colchicine through its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic actions.	2022	02	22	Can J Physiol Pharmacol	Awad	Azza Sayed
34417692	10.1007/s11356-021-15985-x	Landfill soil leachates from Nigeria and India induced DNA damage and alterations in genes associated with apoptosis in Jurkat cell.	Landfill soil leachates, containing myriad of xenobiotics, increase genotoxic and cytotoxic stress-induced cell death. However, the underlying mechanism involved in the elimination of the damaged cells is yet to be fully elucidated. This study investigated the apoptotic processes induced in lymphoma (Jurkat) cells by landfill soil leachates from Olusosun (OSL, Nigeria) and Nagpur (NPL, India). Jurkat was incubated with sub-lethal concentrations of OSL and NPL for 24 h and analyzed for DNA fragmentation and apoptosis using agarose gel electrophoresis and Hoechst 33258-PI staining, respectively. Complementary DNA expression profiling of some pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes regulating apoptosis was also analyzed using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) method. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed DNA fragmentations in OSL and NPL-treated cells. Hoecsht-33258 - Propidium Iodide (PI) based apoptotic analysis confirmed apoptotic cell death in exposed Jurkat. RT-PCR analysis revealed different fold changes in the pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in OSL and NPL-treated Jurkat. There was significant increase in fold change of the up-regulated genes; apoptosis inducing factor mitochondrion-associated 2 (AIFM2), Fas-associated death domain (FADD), Caspase-2, Caspase-6, BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), tumor suppressor (p53), and BCL2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD) and down-regulation of apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5). Results suggest that OSL and NPL elicited genotoxic stress-related apoptosis in Jurkat. The dysregulation in the expression of genes involved in apoptotic processes in wildlife and human exposed to landfill emissions may increase aetiology of various pathological diseases including cancer.	2022	01	20	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Alimba	Chibuisi G
34454850	10.1016/j.clml.2021.07.020	Safety and Efficacy of a DNA Oligonucleotide Therapy in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	PNT2258 is a liposomal formulation that encapsulates multiple copies of PNT100, a native, chemically unmodified, 24-base DNA oligonucleotide designed to target the regulatory region upstream of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene. This phase II, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, 2-stage design study investigated the single-agent activity of PNT2258 in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Initially, patients had to have a performance status (PS) of ≤2 and prior exposure to CD20-targeted therapy, an alkylating agent, and a steroid with no upper limit. Criteria were modified to PS of 0 or 1 and at least 1 to ≤3 prior therapies (identified as the target population) after observing an initially high frequency of rapid disease progression in patients with extensive prior therapies or poor PS. The study was stopped early following an interim analysis, despite surpassing the protocol predetermined futility boundary, because the ORR was below the expectations of response in an evolving DLBCL treatment landscape. The final analysis included all 45 enrolled patients and demonstrated an ORR of 11%. In the response evaluable subset (n = 26), defined as patients in the target population with exposure to ≥8 doses of PNT2258 within the first 35 days and evaluable baseline/post-baseline scans, the ORR was 19%. The most common adverse events were fatigue (44%), nausea (42%), diarrhea (40%), pyrexia (36%), anemia (32%), and vomiting (27%). PNT2258 was well-tolerated in a chemotherapy refractory DLBCL population. Despite demonstration of single-agent activity, ORR was lower than acceptable for further new therapy development.	2022	03	31	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Westin	Jason
34456240	10.1097/PAI.0000000000000967	Screening Strategy for Detecting Double-Hit Lymphoma in a Resource-Limited Setting.	High-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements [double-hit lymphomas (DHL)] are aggressive lymphomas. Current literature recommends fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis (FISH) in all cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) to identify cases of DHL. However, this approach is not feasible in a resource-limited setting. We analyzed cases of de novo high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma using histomorphology, immunohistochemistry and FISH to identify which cases need to undergo FISH testing in a resource-limited setting. Cases of de novo high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that included DLBCL, not otherwise specified and B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable (BCLU) with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma diagnosed over a period of 5 years were analyzed by Hans algorithm, MYC, BCL2, and Ki67. MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 break apart FISH was tested in selected cases. One hundred and nine cases were obtained, of which 102 had DLBCL morphology and 7 had BCLU/blastoid morphology. BCL2 expression was noted in 48 cases (44%), MYC in 33 cases (30.3%) and MYC/BCL2 co-expression in 24 cases (22%). FISH testing could be done in 42 consecutive cases, of which 5 cases had MYC and BCL2 co-rearrangement (11.9%) (double-hit) and 2 cases showed rearrangement for only MYC (4.7%) (single-hit). Single-hit lymphoma/DHL showed significant independent positive correlation with BCLU/blastoid morphology, CD10 expression, germinal center B-cell phenotype, and MYC/BCL2 co-expression. The sensitivity and specificity of each parameters include BCLU/blastoid morphology (42% vs. 94%), CD10 positive (50% vs. 88%), germinal center B-cell phenotype (57% vs. 82%), MYC/BCL2 co-expression (85% vs. 80%). Selected candidates for FISH (any one of the above parameters) using this strategy showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 68%, respectively (P=0.001). We propose a highly sensitive screening strategy for detection of MYC/BCL2 rearrangement in high-grade B-cell lymphoma in a resource-limited setting (pending validation in a larger cohort).	2022	03	16	Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol	Thirunavukkarasu	Balamurugan

High Grade B Cell Lymphoma, NOS, and High Grade B Cell Lymphoma with Dual Hit or Triple Hit have been recently recategorized in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. In this study we have characterized the genetic, histopathological, and clinical features of a series of this type of lymphoid neoplasia (17 HGBCL NOS and 53 HGBCL DH/TH).HGBCL NOS showed better response to first line treatment than HGBCL with DH/TH but no significant differences in PFS or OS were found between the two categories. Survival analysis in the whole cohort of cases found that only the presence of <i>BCL2</i> translocation was significantly associated with PFS.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)<sup>+</sup> diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has specific tumour cell characteristics, and these patients have worse outcomes than EBV-negative DLBCL patients. We compared 38 EBV<sup>+</sup> DLBCL patients with 43 methotrexate-associated EBV<sup>+</sup> B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (MTX<sup>+</sup>/EBV<sup>+</sup> BLPDs) and 30 non-germinal centre (GC) subtype DLBCL. Lymphoma cells of the EBV<sup>+</sup> DLBCL group were positive for BCL2 in 17 patients (44.7%), CMYC in 23 patients (60.5%), and p53 in 33 patients (86.8%), which was significantly higher than in the MTX<sup>+</sup>/EBV<sup>+</sup> BLPD group (P &lt; 0.05), and were positive for CD30 in 29 patients (76.3%), compared with two in non-GC subtype DLBCL (6.7%) (P &lt; 0.0001).

34519021	10.1111/bjh.17815	Clinico-biological features and outcome of patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma with histological transformation.	We describe 36 patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) with transformation (SMZL-T), including 15 from a series of 84 patients with SMZL diagnosed at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB) and 21 diagnosed with SMZL-T in other centres. In the HCB cohort, the cumulative incidence of transformation at 5 years was 15%. Predictors for transformation were cytopenias, hypoalbuminaemia, complex karyotype (CK) and both the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi (ILL) and simplified Haemoglobin, Platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and extrahilar Lymphadenopathy (HPLL)/ABC scores (P &lt; 0·05). The only independent predictor for transformation in multivariate analysis was CK [hazard ratio (HR) 4·025, P = 0·05]. Patients with SMZL-T had a significantly higher risk of death than the remainder (HR 3·89, P &lt; 0·001). Of the 36 patients with SMZL-T, one developed Hodgkin lymphoma and 35 a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 71% with a non-germinal centre phenotype. The main features were B symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and high serum LDH. CK was observed in 12/22 (55%) SMZL-T and fluorescence in situ hybridisation detected abnormalities of MYC proto-oncogene, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (MYC), B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and/or BCL6 in six of 14 (43%). In all, 21 patients received immunochemotherapy, six chemotherapy, one radiotherapy and three splenectomy. The complete response (CR) rate was 61% and the median survival from transformation was 4·92 years. Predictors for a worse survival in multivariate analysis were high-risk International Prognostic Index (HR 5·294, P = 0·016) and lack of CR (HR 2·67, P &lt; 0·001).	2022	02	14	Br J Haematol	Bastidas-Mora	Gabriela
34528680	10.1093/ajcp/aqab128	Recurrent Chromosomal Abnormalities in Tissues Involved by Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.	Prognostically relevant chromosomal abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are routinely identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens. We studied the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities on extramedullary tissues involved by CLL/SLL and evaluated their association with prominent proliferation centers (PPCs). FISH for recurrent abnormalities in CLL/SLL was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy sections. PPCs were identified on H&amp;E-stained sections. Available FISH results on peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens were also reviewed. Recurrent FISH abnormalities were detected in 69% of 320 CLL/SLL biopsy specimens studied, including +12 (35%), 13q- (24%), 11q- (15%), 17p- (6%), 6q- (2%), and IGH/BCL2 (0.9%). Forty-three patients had abnormal blood or bone marrow FISH analyses, of whom 7 (16%) had discordant +12 and/or 13q-, and 3 (7%) had discordant 17p- or 11q-. Morphology was positive (17%), negative (78%), or equivocal (6%) for PPCs on 247 evaluable biopsy specimens, a finding not significantly associated with FISH results (P = .7). Trisomy 12 is overrepresented in tumoral CLL/SLL involvement, compared with the known predominance of 13q- in blood. Discrepancies between leukemic and tissue FISH findings are occasionally encountered. FISH results do not correlate with the presence of PPCs.	2022	03	09	Am J Clin Pathol	Horna	Pedro
34530171	10.1016/j.bone.2021.116182	Mettl3 inhibits the apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes in inflammation through mediating Bcl2 stability via Ythdf1-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification.	N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation is one of the most common internal modifications in eukaryotic messenger RNA occurring on N<sup>6</sup> nitrogen of adenosine. However, the roles of m<sup>6</sup>A in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) are still elusive. Here, we investigate the function and mechanism of methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) in chondrocytes in inflammation. We found that the expression of Mettl3 decreased both in vivo TMJ OA mice and in vitro inflammatory stimulation. Functionally, loss and gain studies illustrated that Mettl3 inhibited the apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes induced by TNF-α stimulation in vitro. Mettl3 inhibitor, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) promoted the apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes with inflammation in vitro and aggravated the degeneration of chondrocytes and subchondral bone in monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) induced TMJ OA mice in vivo. Mechanistically, the bioinformatics analysis, m<sup>6</sup>A-RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were used to identify that Bcl2 mRNA was the downstream target of Mettl3 for m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Furthermore, the results revealed that Yth m<sup>6</sup>A RNA binding protein 1 (Ythdf1) mediated the stability of Bcl2 mRNA catalyzed by Mettl3. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) showed that Bcl2 protein interacted with Beclin1 protein in chondrocytes induced by TNF-α stimulation. In conclusion, our findings identify that Mettl3 inhibits the apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes in inflammation through m<sup>6</sup>A/Ythdf1/Bcl2 signal axis which provides promising therapeutic strategy for TMJ OA.	2022	03	11	Bone	He	Ying
34532813	10.1007/s11010-021-04257-4	Tanshinone I restrains osteosarcoma progression by regulating circ_0000376/miR-432-5p/BCL2 axis.	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as important regulators in cancer progression. Nevertheless, little is known about the biological function of circ_0000376 in the progression of osteosarcoma (OS). Cell viability, colony formation ability, apoptosis, and motility were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. Cellular glycolytic metabolism was analyzed using commercial kits. RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were performed to analyze RNA and protein expression in OS tissues and cells. Starbase software was used to establish circRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA linkage, and intermolecular interaction was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft tumor assay was conducted to analyze the effects of Tanshinone I (Tan I) and circ_0000376 on xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Tan I treatment suppressed the viability, migration, invasion, and glycolysis and triggered the apoptosis of OS cells. Tan I treatment markedly down-regulated circ_0000376 expression in OS cells. The addition of circ_0000376 plasmid largely rescued the malignant behaviors of OS cells upon Tan I exposure. Circ_0000376 interacted with miR-432-5p in OS cells. Circ_0000376 overexpression-mediated protective effects in Tan I-induced OS cells were partly attenuated by the accumulation of miR-432-5p. miR-432-5p bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) in OS cells. miR-432-5p interference-induced effects in Tan I-treated OS cells were partly overturned by the silence of BCL2. Circ_0000376 can act as miR-432-5p sponge to up-regulate BCL2 expression in OS cells. Circ_0000376 silencing contributed to the anti-tumor effect of Tan I on the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. Tan I exerted an anti-tumor role in OS progression by targeting circ_0000376/miR-432-5p/BCL2 axis.	2022	03	14	Mol Cell Biochem	Ye	Baoguo
34538551	10.1016/j.jfma.2021.08.015	Mechanism of quercetin on the improvement of ovulation disorder and regulation of ovarian CNP/NPR2 in PCOS model rats.	To investigate the effects of quercetin on ovulation disorder and expression of androgen receptor (AR) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) / Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 2 (NPR2) in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rat model. DHEA was used to construct the PCOS rat model. After intervention with quercetin, metformin, and AR, the estrous cycle, ovarian and uterine weight of rats were measured. The morphological changes of ovarian and uterine were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemical detection of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), BCL2-Associated X (Bax) and AR expression in ovarian. Determination of the expression of CNP and NPR2 mRNA by qRT-PCR. Chromatin immunocoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to detect the ability of AR to bind to CNP or NPR2 promoter. The results showed that quercetin could significantly reduce the expression of Testosterone (T) , Estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) , LH, Bax, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, increase the expression of FSH and Bcl-2, inhibit the expression of AR, regulate the expression of CNP / NPR2 gene and protein by affecting the combination of AR with the specific sequence of CNP and NPR2 gene promoters, restore the maturation of oocyte and ovulation. The results suggest that quercetin can alleviate the hormone, metabolic and ovulatory aberrations caused by PCOS, and provide experimental basis for the clinical application of quercetin in PCOS.	2022	05	18	J Formos Med Assoc	Zheng	Shaoyan
34601504	10.1038/s41379-021-00938-z	Histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and mutational landscape of follicular lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation.	Follicular lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation (FL-PCD) include two major subtypes: one with predominantly interfollicular PCD that usually harbors a BCL2 rearrangement (BCL2-R), and a second that has predominantly intrafollicular PCD and the frequent absence of a BCL2-R. It is proposed that these latter cases share some features with marginal zone lymphomas (MZL). To further explore this hypothesis in an expanded cohort of FL-PCD, a clinicopathologic investigation of 25 such cases was undertaken including an analysis of their mutational landscape. The 10 interfollicular FL-PCDs exhibited typical intrafollicular centrocytes/centroblasts (90%), CD10 expression (90%), full PCD including expression of CD138 by the plasma cells (PC) (100%), and PCs with class-switched immunoglobulin heavy chains (70%). These cases were BCL2-R positive (100%), BCL6-R positive in 30%, lacked extra BCL2 copies, and only 22% had extra copies of BCL6. Similar to classic FLs, 80% of interfollicular FL-PCDs harbored mutations in epigenetic regulators KMT2D (70%), CREBBP (40%), and/or EZH2 (30%). In contrast, only 45% of 11 intrafollicular FL-PCDs demonstrated typical intrafollicular centrocytes/centroblasts, 55% were CD10(-), 80% contained IgM+ PCs, and only 27% harbored BCL2-Rs. BCL6-Rs were identified in 27% of intrafollicular FL-PCD, while 60% showed extra copies of BCL2 and 50% extra copies of BCL6, consistent with complete or partial trisomies of chromosomes 18 and 3, respectively. Only 54% of intrafollicular FL-PCDs showed mutations in epigenetic regulators. Both subtypes showed mutational differences compared to classic FL, but only the interfollicular subtype showed differences from what is reported for nodal MZL. Four additional cases showed mixed intra- and interfollicular PCD. These results suggest that FL-PCD has some distinctive features and supports the existence of two major subtypes. The interfollicular PCD subtype shares many features with classic FL. The intrafollicular FL-PCDs are more heterogeneous, have differences from classic FL, and have a greater morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic overlap with MZL.	2022	04	01	Mod Pathol	Gibson	Sarah E
34601571	10.1182/blood.2021013156	Effective therapy for AML with RUNX1 mutation by cotreatment with inhibitors of protein translation and BCL2.	The majority of RUNX1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are missense or deletion-truncation and behave as loss-of-function mutations. Following standard therapy, AML patients expressing mtRUNX1 exhibit inferior clinical outcome than those without mutant RUNX1. Studies presented here demonstrate that as compared with AML cells lacking mtRUNX1, their isogenic counterparts harboring mtRUNX1 display impaired ribosomal biogenesis and differentiation, as well as exhibit reduced levels of wild-type RUNX1, PU.1, and c-Myc. Compared with AML cells with only wild-type RUNX1, AML cells expressing mtRUNX1 were also more sensitive to the protein translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (omacetaxine) and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Homoharringtonine treatment repressed enhancers and their BRD4 occupancy and was associated with reduced levels of c-Myc, c-Myb, MCL1, and Bcl-xL. Consistent with this, cotreatment with omacetaxine and venetoclax or BET inhibitor induced synergistic in vitro lethality in AML expressing mtRUNX1. Compared with each agent alone, cotreatment with omacetaxine and venetoclax or BET inhibitor also displayed improved in vivo anti-AML efficacy, associated with improved survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with AML cells harboring mtRUNX1. These findings highlight superior efficacy of omacetaxine-based combination therapies for AML harboring mtRUNX1.	2022	02	23	Blood	Mill	Christopher P

Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a type of low-grade malignant B-cell lymphoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of thymic MALT lymphoma. We analyzed the clinical, morphological, immunophenotypical, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics of 11 cases of thymic MALT lymphoma. The relevant literature was also reviewed. The median age of the 11 patients was 50 (range: 33-60). There was a female predominance with a female-to-male ratio of 10:1. Three patients presented with Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, and type B1 thymoma, respectively. Microscopically, thymic MALT lymphoma was characterized by epithelium-lined cysts that were surrounded by small lymphocytes, centrocyte-like cells, and monocytoid B-cells. Plasmacytic differentiation was observed in two cases. The tumor cells expressed CD20, CD79α, and BCL2. Clonal immunoglobulin genes were detected in all 8 examined cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 18q21 was performed in 7 cases, and no translocations involving 18q21 were found. Targeted gene sequencing was performed in five cases with available DNA samples, and TNFAIP3, CARD11, IGLL5, and CCND3 mutations were identified. Thymic MALT lymphoma is a rare type of B cell malignancy with a female predominance and excellent clinical outcomes. Molecular aberrations involving the NF-κB pathway are frequent in thymic MALT lymphoma, suggesting that dysregulation of the NF-κB pathway is an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of thymic MALT lymphoma.	2022	01	13	Ann Hematol	Wang	Xiaojun
34608246	10.1038/s41379-021-00909-4	Blastoid high-grade B-cell lymphoma initially presenting in bone marrow: a diagnostic challenge.	The 2016 WHO classification introduced the category of high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), which includes one poorly understood subset, blastoid-HGBL. Establishing the diagnosis and distinguishing blastoid-HGBL from B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in bone marrow can be challenging. We assessed 31 cases of blastoid-HGBL diagnosed initially in bone marrow and compared this group to 36 cases of B-ALL using immunophenotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and targeted next generation sequencing analysis. The 31 blastoid-HGBL cases included 14 HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (double hit lymphoma, DHL), 13 HGBL, not otherwise specified (NOS), and four cases with TdT expression that were difficult to classify. Compared with B-ALL, blastoid-HGBL cases more often showed increased intensity/bright expression of CD20, CD38, CD45, BCL-6, and MYC, and less frequent bright expression of CD10 and TdT. Cases of blastoid-HGBL also more frequently had MYC rearrangement, a complex karyotype and TP53 mutation (p &lt; 0.01). With the exception of CD34, no other single factor, including TdT, was sensitive or adequately specific to distinguish blastoid-HGBL from B-ALL. We developed a scoring system using six distinctive features between 16 cases of unequivocal blastoid HGBL and 22 cases of CD34-positive B-ALL, with a score of ≥3 defining blastoid-HGBL. The system was further validated by using 15 cases of surface light chain negative, and/or CD45 dim to negative blastoid-HGBL and 14 cases of CD34-negative B-ALL. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of this scoring system were 100%, 94%, 94%, and 100%, respectively. Using this system, the four cases with TdT expression were all classified as blastoid-HGBL: three were DHL and one was HGBL-NOS. In conclusion, blastoid-HGBL shows distinctive immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features as compared with B-ALL. The proposed scoring system can be helpful for the classification of diagnostically challenging blastoid lymphoid tumors presenting initially in the bone marrow.	2022	04	04	Mod Pathol	Khanlari	Mahsa
34615723	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-2183	Phase I/Ib Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Buparlisib and Ibrutinib Therapy in MCL, FL, and DLBCL with Serial Cell-Free DNA Monitoring.	Activation of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) represent parallel, synergistic pathways in lymphoma pathogenesis. As predominant PI3Kδ inhibition is a possible mechanism of tumor escape, we proposed a clinical trial of dual BTK and pan-PI3K inhibition. We conducted a single-center phase I/Ib trial combining a BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib) and a pan-PI3K inhibitor (buparlisib) in 37 patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphoma. Buparlisib and ibrutinib were administered orally, once daily in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The clinical trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02756247. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) receiving the combination had a 94% overall response rate (ORR) and 33-month median progression-free survival; ORR of 31% and 20% were observed in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, respectively. The maximum tolerated dose was ibrutinib 560 mg plus buparlisib 100 mg and the recommended phase II dose was ibrutinib 560 mg plus buparlisib 80 mg. The most common grade 3 adverse events were rash/pruritis/dermatitis (19%), diarrhea (11%), hyperglycemia (11%), and hypertension (11%). All grade mood disturbances ranging from anxiety, depression, to agitation were observed in 22% of patients. Results from serial monitoring of cell-free DNA samples corresponded to radiographic resolution of disease and tracked the emergence of mutations known to promote BTK inhibitor resistance. BTK and pan-PI3K inhibition in mantle cell lymphoma demonstrates a promising efficacy signal. Addition of BCL2 inhibitors to a BTK and pan-PI3K combination remain suitable for further development in mantle cell lymphoma.	2022	04	07	Clin Cancer Res	Stewart	Caitlin M
34617271	10.1111/bjh.17874	Epstein-Barr virus status of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma is associated with patient age and mutational features.	Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most frequent tumour of children and adolescents but a rare subtype of lymphomas in adults. To date most molecular data have been obtained from lymphomas arising in the young. Recently, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and negative BL in young patients was shown to differ in molecular features. In the present study, we present a large age-overarching cohort of sporadic BL (n = 162) analysed by immunohistochemistry, translocations of MYC proto-oncogene, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (MYC), B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and by targeted sequencing. We illustrate an age-associated inter-tumoral molecular heterogeneity in this disease. Mutations affecting inhibitor of DNA binding 3, HLH protein (ID3), transcription factor 3 (TCF3) and cyclin D3 (CCND3), which are highly recurrent in paediatric BL, and expression of sex determining region Y-box transcription factor 11 (SOX11) declined with patient age at diagnosis (P = 0·0204 and P = 0·0197 respectively). In contrast, EBV was more frequently detected in adult patients (P = 0·0262). Irrespective of age, EBV-positive sporadic BL showed significantly less frequent mutations in ID3/TCF3/CCND3 (P = 0·0088) but more often mutations of G protein subunit alpha 13 (GNA13; P = 0·0368) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1; P = 0·0044) compared to EBV-negative tumours. Our findings suggest that among sporadic BL an EBV-positive subgroup of lymphomas increases with patient age that shows distinct pathogenic features reminiscent of EBV-positive endemic BL.	2022	02	14	Br J Haematol	Richter	Julia
34624089	10.1182/blood.2021012327	Oncogenic role of the SOX9-DHCR24-cholesterol biosynthesis axis in IGH-BCL2+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	Although oncogenicity of the stem cell regulator SOX9 has been implicated in many solid tumors, its role in lymphomagenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, SOX9 was overexpressed preferentially in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) that harbor IGH-BCL2 translocations. SOX9 positivity in DLBCL correlated with an advanced stage of disease. Silencing of SOX9 decreased cell proliferation, induced G1/S arrest, and increased apoptosis of DLBCL cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-transcriptome analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing assays identified DHCR24, a terminal enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, as a direct target of SOX9, which promotes cholesterol synthesis by increasing DHCR24 expression. Enforced expression of DHCR24 was capable of rescuing the phenotypes associated with SOX9 knockdown in DLBCL cells. In models of DLBCL cell line xenografts, SOX9 knockdown resulted in a lower DHCR24 level, reduced cholesterol content, and decreased tumor load. Pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol synthesis also inhibited DLBCL xenograft tumorigenesis, the reduction of which is more pronounced in DLBCL cell lines with higher SOX9 expression, suggesting that it may be addicted to cholesterol. In summary, our study demonstrated that SOX9 can drive lymphomagenesis through DHCR24 and the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This SOX9-DHCR24-cholesterol biosynthesis axis may serve as a novel treatment target for DLBCLs.	2022	02	23	Blood	Shen	Yajie
34632572	10.1111/bjh.17858	Revised International Prognostic Index and genetic alterations are associated with early failure to R-CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases have a poor outcome. Here we analysed clinico-biological features in 373 DLBCL patients homogeneously treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP), in order to identify variables associated with early failure to treatment (EF), defined as primary refractoriness or relapse within 12 months from diagnosis. In addition to clinical features, mutational status of 106 genes was studied by targeted next-generation sequencing in 111 cases, copy number alterations in 87, and gene expression profile (GEP) in 39. Ninety-seven cases (26%) were identified as EF and showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS). Patients with B symptoms, advanced stage, high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β2-microglobulin, low lymphocyte/monocyte ratio and higher Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI) scores, as well as those with BCL2 rearrangements more frequently showed EF, with R-IPI being the most important in logistic regression. Mutations in NOTCH2, gains in 5p15·33 (TERT), 12q13 (CDK2), 12q14·1 (CDK4) and 12q15 (MDM2) showed predictive importance for EF independently from R-IPI. GEP studies showed that EF cases were significantly enriched in sets related to cell cycle regulation and inflammatory response, while cases in response showed over-representation of gene sets related to extra-cellular matrix and tumour microenvironment.	2022	02	14	Br J Haematol	Dlouhy	Ivan
34632715	10.1002/1878-0261.13115	Targeting mitochondrial respiration and the BCL2 family in high-grade MYC-associated B-cell lymphoma.	Multiple molecular features, such as activation of specific oncogenes (e.g., MYC, BCL2) or a variety of gene expression signatures, have been associated with disease course in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), although their relationships and implications for targeted therapy remain to be fully unraveled. We report that MYC activity is closely correlated with-and most likely a driver of-gene signatures related to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in DLBCL, pointing to OxPhos enzymes, in particular mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, as possible therapeutic targets in high-grade MYC-associated lymphomas. In our experiments, indeed, MYC sensitized B cells to the ETC complex I inhibitor IACS-010759. Mechanistically, IACS-010759 triggered the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, driven by the transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, which engaged the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and lowered the apoptotic threshold in MYC-overexpressing cells. In line with these findings, the BCL2-inhibitory compound venetoclax synergized with IACS-010759 against double-hit lymphoma (DHL), a high-grade malignancy with concurrent activation of MYC and BCL2. In BCL2-negative lymphoma cells, instead, killing by IACS-010759 was potentiated by the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845. Thus, combining an OxPhos inhibitor with select BH3-mimetic drugs provides a novel therapeutic principle against aggressive, MYC-associated DLBCL variants.	2022	04	08	Mol Oncol	Donati	Giulio
34637146	10.1111/his.14585	EBV<sup>+</sup> high-grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements: a multi-institutional study.	It is unknown whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can occur in high-grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, also known as double- or triple-hit lymphoma (DHL/THL). Here we report 16 cases of EBV<sup>+</sup> DHL/THL from screening 846 cases of DHL/THL and obtaining additional EBV<sup>+</sup> cases through multi-institutional collaboration: eight MYC and BCL2 DHL, six MYC and BCL6 DHL and two THL. There were eight men and eight women, with a median age of 65 years (range = 32-86). Two patients had a history of follicular lymphoma and one had AIDS. Nine of 14 patients had an International Prognostic Index of ≥3. Half of the cases showed high-grade/Burkitt-like morphology and the other half diffuse large B cell lymphoma morphology. Using immunohistochemistry, the lymphoma cells were positive for MYC (n = 14 of 16), BCL2 (n = 12 of 16), BCL6 (n = 14 of 16), CD10 (n = 13 of 16) and MUM1 (n = six of 14). Using Hans' algorithm, 13 cases were classified as germinal centre B cell (GCB) and three as non-GCB. The lymphomas frequently showed an EBV latency Type I with a median EBV-encoded small RNAs of 80% positive cells (range = 20-100%). After a median follow-up of 36.3 months (range = 2.0-41.6), seven patients died, with a median survival of 15.4 months (range = 3.4-47.3) after diagnosis of EBV<sup>+</sup> DHL/THL. Five of six patients with MYC and BCL6 DHL were alive, including four in complete remission. In contrast, only four of 10 patients with MYC and BCL2 DHL or THL were alive, including two in complete remission. The median survival in patients with MYC and BCL6 DHL was unreached and was 21.6 months in patients with MYC and BCL2 DHL or THL. EBV infection in DHL/THL is rare (~1.5%). Cases of EBV<sup>+</sup> DHL/THL are largely similar to their EBV<sup>-</sup> counterparts clinicopathologically. Our findings expand the spectrum of EBV<sup>+</sup> B cell lymphomas currently recognised in the World Health Organisation classification and suggest differences between EBV<sup>+</sup> MYC and BCL2 DHL versus EBV+MYC and BCL6 DHL that may have therapeutic implications.	2022	03	31	Histopathology	Liu	Hui
34654055	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006034	Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas in adults with aberrant coexpression of CD10, BCL6, and MUM1 are enriched in IRF4 rearrangements.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with aberrant coexpression of CD10+BCL6+MUM1+ (DLBCL-AE), classified as germinal center B cell (GCB) type by the Hans algorithm (HA), was genetically characterized. To capture the complexity of DLBCL-AE, we used an integrated approach that included gene expression profiling (GEP), fluorescence in situ hybridization, targeted gene sequencing, and copy number (CN) arrays. According to GEP, 32/54 (59%) cases were classified as GCB-DLBCL, 16/54 (30%) as activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL, and 6/54 (11%) as unclassifiable. The discrepancy between HA and GEP was 41%. Three genetic subgroups were identified. Group 1 included 13/50 (26%) cases without translocations and mainly showing and ABC/MCD molecular profile. Group 2 comprised 11/50 (22%) cases with IRF4 alterations (DLBCL-IRF4), frequent mutations in IRF4 (82%) and NF-κB pathway genes (MYD88, CARD11, and CD79B), and losses of 17p13.2. Five cases each were classified as GCB- or ABC-type. Group 3 included 26/50 (52%) cases with 1 or several translocations in BCL2/BCL6/MYC/IGH, and GCB/EZB molecular profile predominated. Two cases in this latter group showed complex BCL2/BCL6/IRF4 translocations. DLBCL-IRF4 in adults showed a similar copy number profile and shared recurrent CARD11 and CD79B mutations when compared with LBCL-IRF4 in the pediatric population. However, adult cases showed higher genetic complexity, higher mutational load with frequent MYD88 and KMT2D mutations, and more ABC GEP. IRF4 mutations were identified only in IRF4-rearranged cases, indicating its potential use in the diagnostic setting. In conclusion, DLBCL-AE is genetically heterogeneous and enriched in cases with IRF4 alterations. DLBCL-IRF4 in adults has many similarities to the pediatric counterpart.	2022	04	13	Blood Adv	Frauenfeld	Leonie
34673010	10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109703	The effects of agomelatine on endoplasmic reticulum stress related to mitochondrial dysfunction in hippocampus of aging rat model.	Agomelatine, a novel antidepressant, is a melatonin MT receptor agonist and serotonin 5HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonist. In this study, agomelatine was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hippocampal aging associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, all of which led to short-term memory impairment. Hippocampal aging was induced in male Wistar rats by d-galactose (D-gal) intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg) for 14 weeks. During the last 4 weeks of D-gal treatment, rats were treated with agomelatine (40 mg/kg) or melatonin (10 mg/kg). At the end of the experiment, all rats were assessed for short-term memory by using the Morris water maze test. Subsequently, rats were sacrified and the hippocampus was removed from each rat for determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays; and immunohistochemistry related to ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Agomelatine suppressed the expression of the aging-related proteins P16 and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), the expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 and 4, and ROS production. This treatment also shifted the morphology of astrocytes and microglia toward homeostasis. Furthermore, agomelatine decreased inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (pIRE1), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pPERK), and chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), leading to suppression of ER stress markers C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12. Agomelatine reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER and stabilized the mitochondrial membrane stability, which was denoted by the BCL2 Associated X (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) balance. Agomelatine decreased cleaved caspase-3 production and the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive area, and glutamate excitotoxicity was prevented via suppression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit expression. Agomelatine exhibited effects that were similar to melatonin. Agomelatine improved neurodegeneration in a rat model of hippocampal aging by attenuating ROS production, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis.	2022	01	03	Chem Biol Interact	Chanmanee	Teera
34710243	10.1002/ajh.26390	Hairy cell leukemia 2022: Update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and treatment.	Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and HCL-like disorders, including HCL variant (HCL-V) and splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL), are a very heterogeneous group of mature lymphoid B-cell disorders characterized by the identification of hairy cells, a specific genetic profile, a different clinical course, and the need for appropriate treatment. Diagnosis of HCL is based on morphological evidence of hairy cells, an HCL immunologic score of 3 or 4 based on the CD11C, CD103, CD123, and CD25 expression, the trephine biopsy which makes it possible to specify the degree of tumoral medullary infiltration and the presence of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> somatic mutation. Progression of patients with HCL is based on a large splenomegaly, leukocytosis, a high number of hairy cells in the peripheral blood, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene mutational status. VH4-34-positive HCL cases are associated with a poor prognosis. Patients should be treated only if HCL is symptomatic. Chemotherapy with risk adapted therapy purine analogs (PNAs) are indicated in first-line HCL patients. The use of chemo-immunotherapy combining PNAs and rituximab (R) represents an increasingly used therapeutic approach. Management of relapsed/refractory disease is based on the use of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) plus rituximab or MEK inhibitors (MEKi), recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22 or Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi). However, the optimal sequence of the different treatments remains to be determined. The Bcl2-inhibitors (Bcl-2i) can play a major role in the future.	2022	02	09	Am J Hematol	Troussard	Xavier
34713475	10.1002/hon.2943	Treatment strategies for a rapidly evolving landscape in chronic lymphocytic leukemia management.	With the advent of targeted therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treatment choice has expanded and patients are living longer. Careful consideration is needed regarding treatment duration and sequence, how best to meet patients' needs, balancing toxicities while improving long-term survival and maximizing depth of response. This review addresses these considerations and discusses current targeted treatment dilemmas. Targeted therapies have dramatically transformed the CLL treatment landscape. Two treatment paradigms have emerged using B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors (BCL2i) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK): (i) fixed duration and (ii) continuous treatment. The BCL2i venetoclax can attain deep remissions with a fixed-duration approach, resulting in high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients with CLL. BTKis such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib achieve high objective response rates and long-term disease control, although they rarely attain complete response or uMRD status as monotherapy. Numerous studies are evaluating the clinical utility of BTKi and BCL2i as combination therapies, where deep remissions have been found to occur. MRD status may also be a useful marker for deciding when to stop continuous therapy, and randomized trials on MRD-guided treatment strategies are currently ongoing. The current treatment choice between continuous or fixed-duration therapy should be based on comorbidities, risks, preferences, and treatment goals, whilst areas of emerging clinical interest include the potential utility of BTKi-BCL2i combination therapies, as well as an MRD-guided treatment strategies in the future.	2022	04	07	Hematol Oncol	Eyre	Toby A
34727403	10.1111/pin.13182	AID is a poor prognostic marker of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with MYC rearrangement is defined as double/triple-hit lymphoma (DHL/THL) or single-hit lymphoma (SHL) by the inclusion of the BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements status. DHL/THL is called as ""high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements"" in the World Health Organization 2017 Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. To find a prognostic biomarker of DHL/THL, we firstly examined 19 cases (molecular analysis series;10 cases of DHL/THL and 9 cases of SHL) with gene expression profile analysis. The gene expression profile analysis showed that the high expression of AICDA was associated with an adverse prognosis in DHL/THL, but not in SHL. Then, we evaluated immunohistochemical expression of AID, the protein product of AICDA, in 50 cases (molecular analysis series of 19 cases and additional immunohistochemistry series of 31 cases; 12 cases of DHL/THL and 19 cases of SHL) and confirmed that its expression was also associated with an adverse prognosis in DHL/THL. Therefore, AICDA and AID can be a predictor of an adverse clinical outcome in DHL/THL and immunohistochemistry of AID is useful to find DHL/THL-adverse prognosis group.	2022	03	08	Pathol Int	Miyaoka	Masashi
34727633	10.5713/ab.21.0371	Curcumin represses lipid accumulation through inhibiting ERK1/2-PPAR-γ signaling pathway and triggering apoptosis in porcine subcutaneous preadipocytes.	Excessive lipid accumulation in adipocytes results in prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Curcumin (CUR), a naturally phenolic active ingredient, has been shown to have lipid-lowering effects. However, its underlying mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Therefore, the study aims to determine the effect of CUR on cellular lipid accumulation in porcine subcutaneous preadipocytes (PSPA) and to clarify novel mechanisms. The PSPA were cultured and treated with or without CUR. Both cell counting Kit-8 and lactate dehydrogenase release assays were used to examine cytotoxicity. Intracellular lipid contents were measured by oil-red-o staining extraction and triglyceride quantification. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-nick end labelling assay. Adipogenic and apoptosis genes were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The CUR dose-dependently reduced the proliferation and lipid accumulation of PSPA. Noncytotoxic doses of CUR (10 to 20 μM) significantly inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and expression of adipogenic genes peroxisome proliferation-activity receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, adipocyte protein-2, glucose transporter-4 as well as key lipogenic enzymes fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, while ERK1/2 activation significantly reversed CUR-reduced lipid accumulation by increasing PPAR-γ. Furthermore, compared with differentiation induced media treated cells, higher dose of CUR (30 μM) significantly decreased the expression of AKT and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), while increased the expression of BCL-2-associated X (BAX) and the BAX/BCL-2 expression ratio, suggesting triggered apoptosis by inactivating AKT and increasing BAX/BCL-2 ratio and Caspase-3 expression. Moreover, AKT activation significantly rescued CUR inhibiting lipid accumulation via repressing apoptosis. These results demonstrate that CUR is capable of suppressing differentiation by inhibiting ERK1/2-PPAR-γ signaling pathway and triggering apoptosis via decreasing AKT and subsequently increasing BAX/BCL-2 ratio and Caspase-3, suggesting that CUR provides an important method for the reduction of porcine body fat, as well as the prevention and treatment of human obesity.	2022	07	16	Anim Biosci	Pan	Shifeng
34727830	10.1080/10428194.2021.1998480	Fish evaluation of additional cytogenetic aberrations and hyperdiploidy in childhood Burkitt lymphoma.	Beyond <i>MYC</i> rearrangement, Burkitt lymphoma (BL) often presents with additional aberrations. Biopsy touch imprints from 72 children with BL were tested with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (i-FISH) for <i>MYC</i>, <i>BCL2</i>, <i>BCL6</i>, IGH, IGK and IGL rearrangements and copy-number aberrations involving 1q21/1p32, 7cen/7q31, 9cen/9p21, 13q14/13q34 and 17cen/17p13. Diploid status deviations were investigated with chromosome enumeration probes. <i>MYC</i> rearrangement was demonstrated in all cases. Additional aberrations included +1q (21/72:29.2%), +7q (14/72:19.4%), 13q- (14/72:19.4%), 9p-(6/72:8.3%) and hyperdiploidy (6/72:8.3%). Advanced clinical stage IV, +7q and 9p- were associated with shorter overall survival, with stage IV and +7q retaining prognostic significance on multivariate analysis. No relapse or death was reported among the hyperdiploid cases. This i-FISH investigation provides information on the genetic profile of BL and may prove valuable for patients with no karyotype analysis. Demonstration of hyperdiploidy could evolve research on clonal evolution pathways and probably identify a subgroup of children with favorable prognosis.	2022	04	14	Leuk Lymphoma	Avgerinou	Georgia
34728569	10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0511	Anti-apoptotic MCL1 Protein Represents Critical Survival Molecule for Most Burkitt Lymphomas and BCL2-negative Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas.	The pro-survival MCL1 protein is overexpressed in many cancers, including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL). S63845 is a highly specific inhibitor of MCL1. We analyzed mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to S63845 in preclinical models of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma. Annexin V-based cytotoxic assays, Western blot analysis, protein co-immunoprecipitation, and cell clones with manipulated expression of BCL2 family proteins were used to analyze mechanisms of sensitivity to S63845. Experimental <i>in vivo</i> therapy with S63845 and/or venetoclax was performed using patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of treatment-refractory B-NHL. A subset of DLBCL and majority of Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were sensitive to S63845. The level of BCL2 protein expression was the major determinant of resistance to S63845: BCL2 serves as a buffer for pro-apoptotic proteins released from MCL1 upon exposure to S63845. While BCL2-negative lymphomas were effectively eliminated by single-agent S63845, its combination with venetoclax was synthetically lethal in BCL2-positive PDX models. Concerning MCL1, both, the level of MCL1 protein expression, and its occupational status represent key factors mediating sensitivity to S63845. In contrast to MCL1-BIM/BAK1 complexes that prime lymphoma cells for S63845-mediated apoptosis, MCL1-NOXA complexes are associated with S63845 resistance. In conclusion, MCL1 represents a critical survival molecule for most Burkitt lymphomas and a subset of BCL2-negative DLBCLs. The level of BCL2 and MCL1 expression and occupational status of MCL1 belong to the key modulators of sensitivity/resistance to S63845. Co-treatment with venetoclax can overcome BCL2-mediated resistance to S63845, and enhance efficacy of MCL1 inhibitors in BCL2-positive aggressive B-NHL.	2022	03	30	Mol Cancer Ther	Klanova	Magdalena

Septic acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe illness in clinics. Enriching researches investigated the regulatory network of AKI during the past decades, evidences showed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) were involved in the molecular mechanism of human AKI. However, the special responses remain largely elusive. Thus, the study aims to investigate the function of circ_0114427 in the progression of AKI. The levels of circ_0114427, miR-495-3p and Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) were both assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was applied to establish AKI cell model, and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was carried out to determine the viability of LPS-induced HK-2 cells. The expression of TRAF6, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), cleave-caspase 3, caspase 3, total IκBα (t-IκBα), phospho-IκBα (p-IκBα), total p65 (t-p65) and phospho-p65 (p-p65) were all detected via western blot. The levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were identified by western blot and ELISA. What's more, cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Lastly, dual-luciferase reporter, RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down assays were employed to verify the relationships between miR-495-3p and circ_0114427 or TRAF6 <i>in vitro</i>. The level of miR-495-3p was remarkably restrained while circ_0114427 and TRAF6 levels were specially reinforced in AKI patient serum samples and LPS-induced HK-2 cells. Moreover, IL-1β and TNF-α were highly expressed in LPS-induced AKI cells. Functionally, circ_0114427 was a sponge of miR-495-3p, and circ_0114427 silence-mediated effects in LPS-induced HK-2 cells were partly ameliorated by the addition of miR-495-3p inhibitor. Moreover, TRAF6 was a target gene of miR-495-3p, and the inhibiting effect of miR-495-3p on cell apoptosis and inflammatory response was mitigated by TRAF6 overexpression. Mechanistically, the circ_0114427/miR-495-3p/TRAF6 axis modulated cell apoptosis and inflammatory response via NF-κB/p65 signalling pathway in AKI. Circ_0114427 regulated cell apoptosis and inflammatory response through miR-495-3p/TRAF6 axis via NF-κB/p65 signalling pathway, providing a novel mechanism in clinical treatment of AKI patients.HighlightsCirc_0114427 is upregulated in serum specimens from septic AKI patients and LPS-induced HK-2 cells.LPS treatment suppresses cell viability and promotes apoptosis and inflammation in HK-2 cells.Circ_0114427 knockdown ameliorates the effects of LPS on cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation in HK-2 cells.Circ_0114427 regulates LPS-induced HK-2 cell injury by regulating miR-495-3p/TRAF6/NF-κB/p65 axis.	2022	03	30	Autoimmunity	Xu	Lei
34735897	10.1016/j.tranon.2021.101260	A novel strategy for combination of clofarabine and pictilisib is synergistic in gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer (GC) is frequently characterized by resistance to standard chemotherapeutic regimens and poor clinical outcomes. We aimed to identify a novel therapeutic approach using drug sensitivity testing (DST) and our computational SynerySeq pipeline. DST of GC cell lines was performed with a library of 215 Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved compounds and identified clofarabine as a potential therapeutic agent. RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) of clofarabine treated GC cells was analyzed according to our SynergySeq pipeline and identified pictilisib as a potential synergistic agent. Clonogenic survival and Annexin V assays demonstrated increased cell death with clofarabine and pictilisib combination treatment (P&lt;0.01). The combination induced double strand breaks (DSB) as indicated by phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γH2AX) immunofluorescence and western blot analysis (P&lt;0.01). Pictilisib treatment inhibited the protein kinase B (AKT) cell survival pathway and promoted a pro-apoptotic phenotype as evidenced by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein family members (P&lt;0.01). Patient derived xenograft (PDX) data confirmed that the combination is more effective in abrogating tumor growth with prolonged survival than single-agent treatment (P&lt;0.01). The novel combination of clofarabine and pictilisib in GC promotes DNA damage and inhibits key cell survival pathways to induce cell death beyond single-agent treatment.	2021	12	15	Transl Oncol	Khalafi	Shayan
34739417	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001830	Significance of Single-cell Level Dual Expression of BCL2 and MYC Determined With Multiplex Immunohistochemistry in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fatal heterogenous neoplasm. Recent clinical trials have failed partly due to nebulous criteria for defining high-risk patients. Patients with double-expresser lymphoma (DEL) have a poor prognosis and are resistant to conventional treatment. However, many diagnostic and clinical controversies still surround DEL partly due to the arbitrariness of criteria for the diagnosis of DEL. In this study, we suggest a refined method for diagnosing DEL by evaluating the concurrent expression of BCL2 and MYC at the single-cell level (dual-protein-expressing lymphoma [DUEL]). For the proof of concept, a multiplex immunofluorescence assay for CD20, BCL2, and MYC was performed and quantitatively analyzed using spectral image analysis in patients. The analysis results and clinical applicability were verified by using dual-color immunohistochemistry performed on 353 independent multicenter patients who had been uniformly treated with standard therapy. DUEL showed significantly worse overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) (P=0.00011 and 0.00035, respectively). DUEL status remained an independent adverse prognostic variable with respect to the International Prognostic Index risk and the cell of origin. Moreover, the advantage of determining DUEL status by dual-color immunohistochemistry was shown by more robust classification and more homogeneous high-risk subgroup patient identification in both training (n=271) (OS: P&lt;0.0001; EFS: P&lt;0.0001) and validation sets (n=82) (OS: P=0.0087; EFS: P&lt;0.0001). This concept of DUEL is more consistent with carcinogenesis and has greater practical utility, hence it may provide a better basis for both basic and clinical research for the development of new therapeutics.	2022	03	07	Am J Surg Pathol	Roh	Jin
34747234	10.1177/00031348211054526	Primary Parotid Non-Hodgkin's B-Cell Lymphoma in an Elderly Woman on Pembrolizumab for Metastatic Invasive Papillary Urothelial Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder.	Primary lymphomas of the parotid are rare (4-5%) and seldom appear in patients with pre-existing metastatic cancer from other primary sources. We present a primary marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in an 84-year-old female with preexisting metastatic bladder cancer. A PET scan that identified positive pelvic/cervical lymphadenopathy and bilateral parotid masses. She underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor and started on pembrolizumab chemotherapy. After two years, the left parotid mass decreased in size but the right increased to 3.9cm. Right superficial parotidectomy diagnosed B-Cell Marginal zone lymphoma, staining positive for CD20, PAX5, and Bcl2. pembrolizumab was held and the patient was started on 4 weekly rituximab infusions. A PET scan done 3 months after completion of rituximab showed a good response to chemotherapy. This is the first reported case of a primary parotid gland lymphoma in a patient with active metastatic bladder cancer.	2022	03	16	Am Surg	Osumo	Bismarck
34752896	10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.109241	Excessive manganese alters serum biochemical indices, induces histopathological alterations, and activates apoptosis in liver and cerebrum of Jianzhou Da'er goat (Capra hircus).	The present study aimed to explore the toxic effects of excessive dietary Mn in livers and cerebrums of Jianzhou Da'er goat (Capra hircus). Three-month old goats were assigned into three groups: control group, fed on basal diet; Mn I group, fed on the basal diet mixed with MnCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5 g/kg); Mn II group, fed on the basal diet mixed with MnCl<sub>2</sub> (5 g/kg). Compared with the control group, the activities of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased, but the concentrations of IgG in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased, whereas the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased in livers and cerebrums (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the hepatocytes necrosed, inflammatory cells infiltrated, chromatin concentrated, mitochondrial cristae reduced in Mn I and Mn II groups. The nerve cells necrosed, blood vessels congested, inflammatory cells infiltrated, mitochondrial electron density and mitochondrial cristae decreased, and vacuolization increased in Mn I and Mn II groups. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1), fas-associated protein via a death domain (FADD), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3, 8, 9 (Caspase-3, 8, 9) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), but the mRNA expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in livers. The mRNA expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, 9, 7, 12 in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), however, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in Mn I and Mn II groups was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in cerebrums. In summary, our results provided new insights for better understanding the mechanisms of Mn toxicity in Capra hircus.	2022	03	24	Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol	Xiang	Yi
34756435	10.3168/jds.2021-20364	Acute and chronic effects of cortisol on milk yield, the expression of key receptors, and apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells in Saanen goats.	Cortisol (CORT) induces mammary development in late gestation and is fundamental to the differentiation of mammary epithelial cells and lactogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between CORT, insulin, prolactin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 in milk as well as the effect of CORT on the expression of receptors of insulin (INSR), prolactin (PRLR), growth hormone (GHR); we also studied the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1R), glucocorticoid (NR3C1), mineralocorticoid (NR3C2), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL-2-like protein X (BAX) genes, and the apoptosis rate of mammary epithelial cells of lactating Saanen goats in vivo and in vitro. The following experiments were conducted: (1) comparing hormone release in milk and blood after ACTH or a placebo administration; (2) evaluating the effect of acute CORT increases in mammary gland expression and milk yield in vivo; and (3) evaluating the effect of a chronic increase in CORT concentration in epithelial mammary cell apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, ACTH administration significantly increased CORT release but did not affect insulin, prolactin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 release in plasma and milk versus placebo. The results show also that a low CORT release after ACTH administration increased the expression of GHR and PRLR genes in the mammary tissue. Indeed, CORT release significantly increased the milk yield from goats subjected to ACTH versus goats subjected to the placebo. However, a higher amount of CORT added in vitro upregulated the NR3C1, GHR, PRLR, and BAX genes and downregulated the IGF1R and INSR genes, which could negatively modulate the apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells. Finally, the effect of CORT in vivo after ACTH administration demonstrated the increased expression of the PRLR and GHR genes, which may improve epithelial cell responsiveness and be associated with the positive effect of CORT observed on milk yield at mid-end lactation.	2021	12	27	J Dairy Sci	Bomfim	G F
34764434	10.1038/s41379-021-00962-z	BCL2 super-expressor diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a distinct subgroup associated with poor prognosis.	Overexpression of the BCL2 protein has been reported as a poor prognostic factor for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, there are currently no standardized criteria for evaluating BCL2 protein expression. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of BCL2 expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), incorporating both the staining intensity and proportion, in patients with de novo DLBCL who received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) as first-line treatment. We defined tumors with BCL2 expression in nearly all tumor cells with a uniformly strong intensity by IHC as BCL2 super-expressor. The BCL2 super-expressors (n = 35) showed significantly worse event-free survival (EFS; HR, 1.903; 95% CI, 1.159-3.126, P = 0.011) and overall survival (OS; HR, 2.467; 95% CI, 1.474-4.127, P = 0.001) compared with the non-BCL2 super-expressors (n = 234) independent of the international prognostic index (IPI), cell of origin (COO), and double expressor status in the training set (n = 269). The adverse prognostic impact of BCL2 super-expression was confirmed in the validation set (n = 195). When the survival outcomes were evaluated in the entire cohort (n = 464), BCL2 super-expressor group was significantly associated with inferior EFS and OS regardless of IPI, COO, MYC expression, and stages. BCL2 super-expressors had genetic aberrations enriched in the NOTCH and TP53 signaling pathways. This study suggests that the BCL2 super-expressor characterizes a distinct subset of DLBCL with a poor prognosis and warrants further investigation as a target population for BCL-2 inhibitors.	2022	04	28	Mod Pathol	Roh	Jin
34788985	10.3324/haematol.2021.279631	Mutational landscape of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC-</i>, <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements characterized by whole-exome sequencing.	High-grade B-cell lymphoma accompanied with double/triple-hit MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (HGBLDH/ TH) poses a cytogenetically-defined provisional entity among aggressive B-cell lymphomas that is traditionally associated with unfavorable prognosis. In order to better understand the mutational and molecular landscape of HGBLDH/ TH we here performed whole-exome sequencing and deep panel next-generation sequencing of 47 clinically annotated cases. Oncogenic drivers, mutational signatures and perturbed pathways were compared with data from follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We find an accumulation of oncogenic mutations in NOTCH, IL6/JAK/STAT and NFκB signaling pathways and delineate the mutational relationship within the continuum between FL/DLBCL, HGBL-DH/TH and BL. Further, we provide evidence of a molecular divergence between BCL2 and BCL6 rearranged HGBL-DH. Beyond a significant congruency with the C3/EZB DLBCL cluster in BCL2 rearranged cases on an exome-wide level, we observe an enrichment of the SBS6 mutation signature in BCL6 rearranged cases. Differential gene set enrichment and subsequent network propagation analysis according to cytogenetically defined subgroups revealed an impairment of TP53 and MYC pathway signaling in BCL2 rearranged cases, whereas BCL6 rearranged cases lacked this enrichment, but instead showed impairment of E2F targets. Intriguingly, HGBL-TH displayed intermediate mutational features considering all three aspects. This study elucidates a recurrent pattern of mutational events driving FL into MYC-driven BCL2-rearranged HGBL, unveiling the mutational pathogenesis of this provisional entity. Through this refinement of the molecular taxonomy for aggressive, germinal center-derived B-cell lymphomas, this calls into question the current World Health Organization classification system, especially regarding the status of MYC/BCL6- rearranged HGBL.	2022	08	02	Haematologica	Künstner	Axel
34793256	10.1200/JCO.21.01194	Venetoclax in Previously Treated Waldenström Macroglobulinemia.	BCL2 is overexpressed and confers prosurvival signaling in malignant lymphoplasmacytic cells in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Venetoclax is a potent BCL2 antagonist and triggers in vitro apoptosis of WM cells. The activity of venetoclax in WM remains to be clarified. We performed a multicenter, prospective phase II study of venetoclax in patients with previously treated WM (NCT02677324). Venetoclax was dose-escalated from 200 mg to a maximum dose of 800 mg daily for up to 2 years. Thirty-two patients were evaluable, including 16 previously exposed to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis). All patients were <i>MYD88 L265P</i>-mutated, and 17 carried <i>CXCR4</i> mutations. The median time to minor and major responses was 1.9 and 5.1 months, respectively. Previous exposure to BTKis was associated with a longer time to response (4.5 <i>v</i> 1.4 months; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). The overall, major, and very good partial response rates were 84%, 81%, and 19%, respectively. The major response rate was lower in those with refractory versus relapsed disease (50% <i>v</i> 95%; <i>P</i> = .007). The median follow-up time was 33 months, and the median progression-free survival was 30 months. <i>CXCR4</i> mutations did not affect treatment response or progression-free survival. The only recurring grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse event was neutropenia (n = 14; 45%), including one episode of febrile neutropenia. Laboratory tumor lysis without clinical sequelae occurred in one patient. No deaths have occurred. Venetoclax is safe and highly active in patients with previously treated WM, including those who previously received BTKis. <i>CXCR4</i> mutation status did not affect treatment response.	2022	02	21	J Clin Oncol	Castillo	Jorge J
34795418	10.1038/s41375-021-01470-4	Inhibitors of Bcl-2 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase synergize to abrogate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth in vitro and in orthotopic xenotransplantation models.	Numerous targeted therapies have been developed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but the results of late-stage clinical trials were mostly disappointing and have led to very few new regulatory approvals. Here, we use single and combinatorial drug response profiling to show that the combined inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of the tyrosine kinase BTK with the small molecules venetoclax and ibrutinib efficiently kills DLBCL cells in vitro. High Bcl-2 expression due to either BCL2 amplifications or translocations, in conjunction with chronic active BCR signaling accurately predict responses to dual Bcl-2/BTK inhibition. Orthotopic xenotransplantation and patient-derived xenograft models confirm that the combinatorial is superior to single-agent treatment in reducing the lymphoma burden. Combinatorial treatment further efficiently overcomes both primary and acquired resistance to venetoclax, which we could link to reduced expression of the Bcl-2 family members Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> and Bcl-2A1 under ibrutinib. We found in a Swiss DLBCL cohort that ~15% of patients are projected to respond to the venetoclax/ibrutinib combination based on their high Bcl-2 expression and nuclear NF-κB localization. Our data show that drug sensitivities exposed by drug response profiling can be attributed to specific mutational signatures and immunohistochemical biomarkers, and point to combined Bcl-2/BTK inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in DLBCL.	2022	04	06	Leukemia	Bertram	Katrin
34802044	10.1038/s41379-021-00954-z	A novel diagnostic approach for the classification of small B-cell lymphoid neoplasms based on the NanoString platform.	Small B-cell lymphoid neoplasms (SBCLNs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by malignant clonal proliferation of mature B-cells. However, the classification of SBCLNs remains a challenge, especially in cases where histopathological analysis is unavailable or those with atypical laboratory findings or equivocal pathologic data. In this study, gene expression profiling of 1039 samples from 27 gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets was first investigated to select highly and differentially expressed genes among SBCLNs. Samples from 57 SBCLN cases and 102 nonmalignant control samples were used to train a classifier using the NanoString platform. The classifier was built by employing a cascade binary classification method based on the random forest algorithm with 35 refined gene signatures. Cases were successively classified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, conventional mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, leukemic non-nodal mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and other undetermined. The classifier algorithm was then validated using an independent cohort of 197 patients with SBCLNs. Under the distribution of our validation cohort, the overall sensitivity and specificity of proposed algorithm model were &gt;95%, respectively, for all the cases with tumor cell content greater than 0.72. Combined with additional genetic aberrations including IGH-BCL2 translocation, MYD88 L265P mutation, and BRAF V600E mutation, the optimal sensitivity and specificity were respectively found at 0.88 and 0.98. In conclusion, the established algorithm demonstrated to be an effective and valuable ancillary diagnostic approach for the sub-classification and pathologic investigation of SBCLN in daily practice.	2022	04	28	Mod Pathol	Zhang	Wei
34821081	10.1002/cnr2.1590	Mantle cell lymphoma: A clinical review of the changing treatment paradigms with the advent of novel therapies, and an insight into Indian data.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare type of mature B-cell lymphoid malignancy with the pathologic hallmark of translocation t(11;14) (q13, q32), which leads to an overexpression of Cyclin D1 (CCND1). The disease is also characterized by the presence of a high number of recurrent genetic alterations, which include aberrations in several cellular pathways. MCL is a heterogeneous disease with a wide range of clinical presentations and a majority presenting with aggressive disease in advanced stages. Management of MCL is bereft with challenges due to its resistant and relapsing pattern. Despite improvements in remission durations, the disease is currently incurable with standard therapy and has a median survival of about 3-5 years. The use of small molecules like the bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and BCL2 inhibitors, for treating relapsed MCL has been established leading to a diminishing role for conventional chemotherapy. Combinations of small molecule inhibitors with or without chemoimmunotherapy, are showing promising results. Cellular therapy in the form of CAR-T cell therapy, has been approved recently. Personalized cancer treatment and chemo-free regimens are showing promise and results from well-planned long-term studies are evolving. In India, there is a paucity of epidemiological, clinical, and research data in this field.	2022	07	28	Cancer Rep (Hoboken)	Radhakrishnan	Vivek Sulekha
34837284	10.1111/cas.15224	Decreased expression of T-cell-associated immune markers predicts poor prognosis in patients with follicular lymphoma.	We previously examined the utility of rituximab-bendamustine (RB) in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) exhibiting less than optimal responses to 2 cycles of the R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen. The aim of this study was to identify molecular biomarkers that can predict prognosis in RB-treated patients in the context of the prospective cohort. We first analyzed the mutational status of 410 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens by target capture and Sanger sequencing. CREBBP, KMT2D, MEF2B, BCL2, EZH2, and CARD11 were recurrently mutated as reported before, however none was predictive for progression-free survival (PFS) in the RB-treated patients (n = 34). A gene expression analysis by nCounter including 800 genes associated with carcinogenesis and/or the immune response showed that expression levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell markers and half of the genes regulating Th1 and Th2 responses were significantly lower in progression of disease within the 24-mo (POD24) group (n = 8) than in the no POD24 group (n = 31). Collectively, we selected 10 genes (TBX21, CXCR3, CCR4, CD8A, CD8B, GZMM, FLT3LG, CD3E, EOMES, GZMK), and generated an immune infiltration score (IIS) for predicting PFS using principal component analysis, which dichotomized the RB-treated patients into immune IIS<sup>high</sup> (n = 19) and IIS<sup>low</sup> (n = 20) groups. The 3-y PFS rate was significantly lower in the IIS<sup>low</sup> group than in the IIS<sup>high</sup> group (50.0% [95% CI: 27.1-69.2%] vs. 84.2% [95% CI: 58.7-94.6%], P = .0237). Furthermore, the IIS was correlates with absolute lymphocyte counts at diagnosis (r = 0.460, P = .00355). These results suggest that the T-cell-associated immune markers could be useful to predict prognosis in RB-treated FL patients. (UMIN:000 013 795, jRCT:051 180 181).	2022	02	11	Cancer Sci	Rai	Shinya
34842019	10.1080/10428194.2021.2008383	Fitting double-hit lymphoma into the aggressive lymphoma spectrum: a square peg in a round hole?	High-grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements or both, commonly called double-hit lymphoma (DHL), is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that is molecularly distinct from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and is associated with poor outcomes. Recent advances in the molecular classification of DLBCL have identified distinct subsets, including genetic signatures which correlate with DHL and survival. DHL with concomitant <i>TP53</i> mutation appears to be associated with a very poor prognosis. Standard chemo-immunotherapy is not an effective treatment for these patients and personalized, innovative strategies are needed. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the subclassification of DLBCL, with a focus on DHL. We also incorporate early, promising clinical trial data using CAR T and targeted therapies. Rationally designed clinical trials for DLBCL are needed to advance the care of patients with DHL and other adverse risk DLBCL subgroups.	2022	05	25	Leuk Lymphoma	Gordon	Max J
34848360	10.1016/j.jep.2021.114873	Crocetin ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modulating mitochondrial dysfunction in L02 cells and zebrafish model.	Traditional Chinese medicine considers that the etiology and pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are related to liver depression and qi stagnation. Saffron and its active ingredient, crocetin (CCT), are used for the treatment of metabolic diseases owing to their ""Liver deobstruent"" and ""Liver tonic"" effects. However, the effect of CCT on NAFLD has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the effect and potential molecular mechanism of CCT were explored in both in vivo and in vitro models of NAFLD. CCT was isolated from saffron and purity and structure characterization were performed using HPLC, MS, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. The effect of CCT on the viability of L02 cells and its maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) in zebrafish were investigated. Free fatty acids (FFA) and thioacetamide (TAA) were used to induce lipid accumulation in L02 cells and steatosis in zebrafish, respectively. The effects of CCT on indexes related to lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function in NAFLD models were explored using biochemical assay kits, Western blot analysis, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), histopathology analysis, and determination of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Morphological analysis of mitochondria was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and alanine/aspartate aminotransferases (ALT/AST) activities in FFA treated L02 cells were significantly reduced after CCT treatment. CCT treatment significantly increased ATP concentration, ΔΨm, and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) in FFA treated L02 cells. TEM images showed restoration of mitochondrial morphology. CCT decreased ATP concentration and upregulated expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and COX IV, whereas, CCT downregulated expression of BCL2-Associated X (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3 in TAA treated zebrafish. These findings indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction was alleviated after CCT treatment. Oil Red O staining of L02 cells and zebrafish showed that CCT treatment reversed the accumulation of lipid droplets. In summary, CCT treatment effectively alleviated the symptoms of NAFLD and restored mitochondrial function in L02 cells and zebrafish NAFLD model.	2022	02	14	J Ethnopharmacol	Xu	Zijin

The P<sub>4</sub>:E<sub>2</sub> ratio was significantly lower in the active follicle (0.43 ± 0.08) than that of the intermediate (3.46 ± 0.53) and atretic (28.4 ± 10.6) follicles (P &lt; 0.05). Relative fold change in the transcripts of kisspeptin (Kiss1), Kiss1r, gonadotrophin receptors, steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), cytochrome P450 Family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1), insulin like growth factor -1 (IGF-1), apoptotic factors (caspase 3 and B-cell lymphoma 2, BCL2) was calculated using qPCR in the follicular wall of the three categories of follicle (n = 8/group). In another experiment, histological sections of the ovary (n = 41) were used to group the follicles as described above and immunostaining of Kp, Kiss1r and aromatase was done. A significant upregulation of StAR, CYP11A1 and CYP19A1 in the active follicles supported the endocrine basis of follicular classification. The transcripts of Kiss1 and Kiss1r were upregulated by 19.45 fold and 4.25 fold, respectively in the active follicle as compared to other groups. Immunolocalization studies revealed that Kp and Kiss1r were localized to the basal and antral granulosa cells (GC) of the active and intermediate follicles; however, the staining intensity was stronger in the former group. Strong expression of CYP19A1 in the GC layer of active follicle supported the histological basis of defining the functional status of the follicle. It is concluded that the follicular compartment of the bubaline ovary expressed the constituents of kisspeptinergic system. The expression of Kp and Kiss1r was influenced by the functional status of the follicle with intense localization in the GC layer of the active follicles.	2022	01	04	Theriogenology	Rajin	T R
34861696	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006211	Single-cell sequencing demonstrates complex resistance landscape in CLL and MCL treated with BTK and BCL2 inhibitors.	The genomic landscape of resistance to targeted agents (TAs) used as monotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is complex and often heterogeneous at the patient level. To gain insight into the clonal architecture of acquired genomic resistance to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors in CLL, particularly in patients carrying multiple resistance mutations, we performed targeted single-cell DNA sequencing of 8 patients who developed progressive disease (PD) on TAs (either class). In all cases, analysis of single-cell architecture revealed mutual exclusivity between multiple resistance mutations to the same TA class, variable clonal co-occurrence of multiple mutations affecting different TAs in patients exposed to both classes, and a phenomenon of multiple independent emergences of identical nucleotide changes leading to canonical resistance mutations. We also report the first observation of established BCL2 resistance mutations in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) following PD on sequential monotherapy, implicating BCL2 as a venetoclax resistance mechanism in MCL. Taken together, these data reveal the significant clonal complexity of CLL and MCL progression on TAs at the nucleotide level and confirm the presence of multiple, clonally independent, mechanisms of TA resistance within each individual disease context.	2022	04	05	Blood Adv	Thompson	Ella R
34864562	10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.11.022	Protegrin-1 inhibits porcine ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress via the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP signaling pathway in vitro.	In mammals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of granulosa cells is one of the major causes of follicular atresia, affecting ovarian physiological function. Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is an antimicrobial peptide with effective antimicrobial activity, immunomodulatory function, and porcine growth-promoting effects. PG-1 has been detected in porcine ovaries follicles. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PG-1 on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of porcine ovarian granulosa cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Granulosa cells were obtained from porcine follicles and treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to establish the oxidative stress model, and then treated with or without PG-1 (10 μg/mL). PG-1 significantly suppressed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in granulosa cells after 24 h of treatment. Furthermore, these results revealed that PG-1 increased the mRNA and protein expression of anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL2) and the BCL2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) ratio while decreasing the expression of pro-apoptotic BAX and active caspase-3. Using Western blot analysis, it was found that PG-1 decreased the phosphorylation of RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) as well as the protein expression level of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), all of which were increased by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, inhibitors against PERK and phospho-eIF2ɑ both suppressed the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced granulosa cells apoptosis and enhanced the anti-apoptosis effect of PG-1. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that PG-1 inhibited porcine ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis from oxidative stress via the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP signaling pathway in vitro, which suggests the novel regulatory function of the antimicrobial peptide in the ovary.	2022	01	04	Theriogenology	Li	Xuan
34866456	10.1177/10668969211065110	Endometrial Stromal Expression of ER, PR, and B-Catenin Toward Differentiating Hyperplasia Diagnoses.	<i>Background.</i> The interpretation of histopathological changes of endometrial hyperplasia with or without atypia can be challenging. We aim to investigate the role of specific immunohistochemical markers in the endometrial stroma to classify endometrial hyperplasia in difficult cases. <i>Methods and Results.</i> We retrospectively reviewed and reclassified (WHO 2014): 47 specimens with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, 33 with atypical hyperplasia (AH), and 13 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. We performed IHC for B-catenin, E-cadherin, p16, estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Percentage of positive stromal cells was calculated. B-catenin was equally expressed in the stroma of both hyperplasia and AH (mean 60%, 50%; <i>P</i> = .17) and was absent from adenocarcinoma (0%, hyperplasia vs adenocarcinoma; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001, AH vs adenocarcinoma; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001). E-cadherin was not expressed in the stroma of any lesion, while p16 expression levels were not statistically different (hyperplasia vs AH; <i>P</i> = .46, hyperplasia vs adenocarcinoma; <i>P</i> = .22, AH vs adenocarcinoma; <i>P</i> = .48). Estrogen and progesterone were highly identified in stromal cells of hyperplasia (80%) and diminished in AH (respectively, at 30% and 60%, hyperplasia vs AH; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001), and in adenocarcinoma (0% and 40%, respectively). Finally, BCL2 was not differentially expressed (hyperplasia vs AH; <i>P</i> = .33, hyperplasia vs adenocarcinoma; <i>P</i> = .17, AH vs adenocarcinoma; <i>P</i> = .36). <i>Conclusion</i>. Estrogen and progesterone were strongly expressed in stroma exclusively of hyperplasia, while B-catenin was particularly expressed in hyperplasia and AH. Use of these markers can be useful in the differential diagnosis of hyperplasia from AH, and AH from adenocarcinoma in challenging cases.	2022	07	06	Int J Surg Pathol	Chatzipantelis	Paschalis

34878357	10.1080/14737159.2022.2016394	Association between serum concentrations of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 protein and traumatic brain injury mortality.	There are scarce and contradictory data existing about B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), one of the Bcl2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze whether blood concentrations of Bcl2 are associated with mortality. Patients with isolated and severe TBI, defined as &lt;10 points of the Injury Severity Score (ISS) in non-cranial aspects and &lt;9 points in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), were included. This was an observational and prospective study carried out in five Intensive Care Units. Serum Bcl2 concentrations on day 1 of TBI were determined. Serum Bcl2 concentrations were lower (p &lt; 0.001) in surviving patients (n = 59) compared to non-survivors (n = 24). We found an association between serum Bcl2 levels and mortality controlling for age and GCS (OR = 1.149; 95% CI = 1.056-1.251; p = 0.001) and controlling for computer tomography findings (OR = 1.147; 95% CI = 1.056-1.246; p = 0.001). This study reports for the first time an association between serum Bcl2 levels and 30-day mortality in TBI patients.	2022	04	01	Expert Rev Mol Diagn	Lorente	Leonardo
34896653	10.1016/j.jtct.2021.12.001	Inhibition of IL-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 1 Decreases Murine Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease While Preserving the Graft-versus-Lymphoma Effect.	Activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is crucial in initiating inflammation and alloreaction during acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), a common life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) regulates the activation of APCs in inflammatory settings, and inhibition of IRAK1 might decrease APC activation and aGVHD. This study was conducted to explore the impact of IRAK1 inhibition on APC activation and aGVHD in mice. We administered a selective IRAK1 inhibitor, Jh-X-119-01, to recipient mice undergoing allo-HCT or co-challenged by A20 lymphoma cells. We assessed aGVHD and the graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect. T cell and APC activations were analyzed as well. Jh-X-119-01 was associated with increased survival and decreased aGVHD of recipients. Jh-X-119-01 decreased the proportions of Th1 cells and Tc1 cells in the aGVHD model and in the in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction. The IRAK1 inhibitor reduced production of TNFα and IFNγ in macrophages of recipient mice. In in vitro cultured bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs), Jh-X-119-01 decreased productions of inflammatory cytokines, reduced expression levels of CD80 and CD86, and decreased protein levels of antiapoptotic Bcl2 and phosphorylated NF-κB p65. RNA-seq analysis showed that Jh-X-119-01 had an impact on several pathophysiologic processes of BMDCs, including reduction of GVHD-related genes and regulation of helper T cell differentiation. Importantly, IRAK1 inhibition did not impair cytotoxic function of T cells or the allo-HCT-related GVL effect against A20 lymphoma cells. In addition, the IRAK1 inhibitor did not retard recovery of hematopoietic cells in blood or bone marrow. Our findings show that selective IRAK1 inhibition ameliorates murine aGVHD but preserves the GVL effect. Our findings may have implications for the use of an IRAK1 inhibitor in allo-HCT.	2022	04	20	Transplant Cell Ther	Gao	Jun
34896889	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2021.151868	Merkel cell carcinoma in the setting of hematologic disease is associated with unique features and potential pitfalls.	Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, often associated with polyomavirus and ultra-violet light exposure. Immunosuppression is associated with increased risk of development of MCC, including that associated with hematolymphoid disorders such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). We sought to determine whether MCC arising in patients with hematologic disorders showed unique features. Searching archived material at three institutions, we identified 13 patients with MCC and at least one hematologic malignancy and 41 patients with MCC with no reported hematologic malignancy. CLL/SLL was the most common hematologic disorder in this setting (9/13 cases). Clinical history, variation in morphologic appearance, unusual site distribution and concern for progression of underlying hematologic disease all contributed to potential diagnostic challenges. Overlapping marker expression between MCC and hematologic neoplasms created potential diagnostic pitfalls (e.g. CD138, Pax5, TdT, Bcl2, CD56, and CD117). In addition, we newly identify expression of CD5 and LEF-1 in a subset of MCC, including in patients with CLL/SLL. MCC in patients with hematologic malignancy were more common in men (92% versus 59%, p &lt; 0.05) and showed an unusual site predilection to non-sun exposed sites (3/13 on the buttocks) with none presenting on the face or scalp. By contrast, face or scalp lesions were common in MCC without an associated hematologic malignancy (17/41, p &lt; 0.05). Our findings reaffirm the need for skin surveillance in the setting of immune deficiency and for vigilance to identify unusual presentations of MCC in patients with or without hematologic disorders.	2022	03	22	Ann Diagn Pathol	Katerji	Roula
34913064	10.3892/mmr.2021.12566	Substance P prevents doxorubicin‑induced cardiomyocyte injury by regulating apoptosis and autophagy: <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> evidence.	The function of substance P (SP) in myocardial ischemia is well understood, but its effects on congestive heart failure are unclear. The present study aimed to use <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> approaches to investigate the effects of SP on doxorubicin‑induced cardiomyocyte injury. Pathological changes, apoptosis, cardiomyocyte ultrastructure and molecular mechanisms were evaluated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The effects of SP on cell viability of H9c2 myocardial cells were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit‑8 and flow cytometry. B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax), Beclin‑1 and microtubule‑associated protein 1A/1B‑light chain 3 (LC3) were detected by western blotting. Heart failure in rats was established by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin. The <i>in vitro</i> data demonstrated that SP at concentrations of 1 <i>µ</i>g/ml inhibited doxorubicin‑induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells. Administration of doxorubicin reduced Bcl‑2, Beclin‑1 and LC3 expression levels in H9c2 cells, while having no effect on Bax levels. Administration of SP to these doxorubicin‑treated cells did not affect Bcl‑2 or Bax expression, but further reduced Beclin‑1 while inhibiting the reduction in LC3 expression. <i>In vivo</i>, food intake was significantly increased in rats in the SP group compared with the model group. Cardiomyocytes in the heart‑failure group underwent dysfunctional autophagy as ascertained by transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the heart‑failure group, these pathological changes, including loss of striations and vacuolation, were inhibited by SP treatment, which promoted Bax expression, reduced Beclin‑1 expression and inhibited the reduction in LC3 expression. Taken together, SP reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in doxorubicin‑induced cardiomyocyte injury, likely by promoting autophagy, which suggested that SP is a potential therapeutic target for doxorubicin‑induced heart failure.	2022	03	09	Mol Med Rep	Chen	Fa-Xiu
34913075	10.3892/or.2021.8241	Niclosamide suppresses T‑cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia growth through activation of apoptosis and autophagy.	T‑cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T‑ALL) is a common pediatric malignancy, characterized by the abnormal presence of immature T‑cell progenitors. Conventional treatments for T‑ALL fail to prevent or cure the disease, with a high‑risk of recurrence after the first remission. Thus, medical options are in demand to develop novel therapies for patients suffering with T‑ALL. Niclosamide, a traditional oral anti‑helminthic drug, has been reported to be a potential anticancer agent that regulates intracellular signaling pathways. Few studies have yet investigated the effects of niclosamide on the development of T‑ALL. Here, the present study aimed to investigate the anti‑leukemia effects of niclosamide on T‑ALL. We first hypothesized that the suppressive effects of niclosamide on the tumor growth of T‑ALL are exerted by regulating autophagy and apoptosis. Following niclosamide treatment, T‑ALL cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay, and apoptosis with Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. In T‑ALL cells treated with niclosamide, changes in apoptosis‑ and autophagy‑related proteins were analyzed by western blotting. In addition, in an <i>in vivo</i> model, T‑ALL xenograft mice were used to study the anti‑leukemia effects of niclosamide. The results showed that niclosamide significantly reduced the viability of Jurkat and CCRF‑CEM T‑ALL cells in both a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner. Niclosamide significantly activated the early and late phases of apoptosis in Jurkat (at 2 µM) and CCRF‑CEM cells (at 1 µM). Furthermore, niclosamide upregulated protein expression of cleaved caspase‑3 and LC3B, while downregulated those of Bcl‑2 and p62, in a dose‑dependent manner in both Jurkat and CCRF‑CEM cells. The <i>in vivo</i> results showed that niclosamide treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth and the disease progression in T‑ALL xenograft mice by activating cleaved caspase‑3 and LC3B. We conclude that niclosamide plays an anti‑leukemia role, and that it represents a novel approach for the treatment of T‑ALL.	2022	01	10	Oncol Rep	Huang	Fang-Liang
34913076	10.3892/ijo.2021.5292	Synergism of a novel MCL‑1 downregulator, acriflavine, with navitoclax (ABT‑263) in triple‑negative breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme.	Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL‑1), an anti‑apoptotic B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‑2) family molecule frequently amplified in various human cancer cells, is known to be critical for cancer cell survival. MCL‑1 has been recognized as a target molecule for cancer treatment. While various agents have emerged as potential MCL‑1 blockers, the present study presented acriflavine (ACF) as a novel MCL‑1 inhibitor in triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC). Further evaluation of its treatment potential on lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was also investigated. The anticancer effect of ACF on TNBC cells was demonstrated when MDA‑MB‑231 and HS578T cells were treated with ACF. ACF significantly induced typical intrinsic apoptosis in TNBCs in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner via MCL‑1 downregulation. MCL‑1 downregulation by ACF treatment was revealed at each phase of protein expression. Initially, transcriptional regulation via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was validated. Then, post‑translational regulation was explained by utilizing an inhibitor against protein biosynthesis and proteasome. Lastly, immunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated MCL‑1 confirmed the post‑translational downregulation of MCL‑1. In addition, the synergistic treatment efficacy of ACF with the well‑known MCL‑1 inhibitor ABT‑263 against the TNBC cells was explored [combination index (CI)&lt;1]. Conjointly, the anticancer effect of ACF was assessed in GBM (U87, U251 and U343), and lung cancer (A549 and NCI‑H69) cell lines as well, using immunoblotting, cytotoxicity assay and FACS. The effect of the combination treatment using ACF and ABT‑263 was estimated in GBM (U87, U343 and U251), and non‑small cell lung cancer (A549) cells likewise. The present study suggested a novel MCL‑1 inhibitory function of ACF and the synergistic antitumor effect with ABT‑263.	2022	03	14	Int J Oncol	Lee	Anbok
34920187	10.1016/j.anireprosci.2021.106908	Silver nanoparticles induce oxidative stress, apoptosis and impaired steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cells of cattle.	There have been increased effects of silver nanoparticle (Ag-NPs) on livestock during the past decade, but data related to adverse effects of Ag-NPs on reproductive tissues are limited. In the present study, the possible cytotoxic effects of Ag-NPs on oxidant/antioxidant balance, apoptosis and steroid hormone production in ovarian granulosa cells of cattle were studied.Cultured granulosa cells were treated with 10 nm Ag-NPs at various concentrations (1-100 µg/ml) for 24 h, and cell toxicity, oxidant/antioxidant markers, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, abundances of apoptotic/antiapoptotic and steroidogenesis related mRNA transcripts were determined. The amount of DNA fragmentation was also determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Results indicated treatment of granulosa cells with Ag-NPs induced an increase of reactive oxygen species production concomitant with increased malondialdehyde concentrations and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities. There was a maximal percentage of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells (46.6%) after treatment with 50 and 100 µg/ml of Ag-NPs. The Ag-NPs could induce apoptosis in granulosa cells as indicated by the increase in caspase-3 activity, and larger abundance of BCL2 associated X (BAX) and lesser abundance of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) mRNA transcripts. The abundance of steroidogenic enzyme mRNA transcripts decreased concomitant with suppression of steroid hormone synthesis from Ag-NP-treated cells. Findings indicate silver nanoparticles (SNP) induce apoptosis and oxidative stress and change the pattern of steroid hormone synthesis in granulosa cells of cattle. The results indicate Ag-NPs may inhibit the function and viability of ovarian cells.	2022	02	02	Anim Reprod Sci	Tabandeh	Mohammad Reza
34922904	10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109779	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-derived exosomes push macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotype via GP130/STAT3 signaling pathway.	Growing evidence shows that cancer progression links with both heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment and dysregulated activity of immune cells. Cancer-secreted exosomes are being recognized as indispensable mediators of the exchange cargo between cancer and immune cells. The M2-phenotype tumor-associated macrophages have the function of promoting tumor progression and drug resistance. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous and very common malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Here, we demonstrate that different subtype DLBCL cell-derived exosomes are internalized by macrophages, which can affect macrophages polarization. The mechanism of DLBCL-derived exosomes on macrophage polarization remains unclear currently. This study showed that DLBCL-secreted exosomes could induce the transformation of macrophages to a protumor M2-like phenotype, and block the drug-induced apoptosis of DLBCL cells in an indirect co-culture system. Different DLBCL-derived exosomes could change the phenotype of macrophages through the STAT3 signaling, which upregulated the expression of oncogenic genes and classical markers of M2-like phenotype macrophages, such as IL-10, CD206, and CD163. The addition of DLBCL-derived exosomes resulted in the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway of M0/M2 macrophages in an indirect co-culture system. GP130 was highly enriched in DLBCL-derived exosomes, which triggered the activation of STAT3 of macrophages and subsequently induced the downstream targets such as BCL2, SURVIVIN, and BAX. The parallel changes of STAT3 and GP130 in macrophages confirmed that GP130 of DLBCL-derived exosomes promoted macrophage polarization by activating STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, all of these effects could be reversed by the GP130 inhibitor SC144. The data indicated that DLBCL-derived exosomes could trigger macrophages polarization into a pro-survival M2-like phenotype, which was at least partially through the GP130/STAT3 signaling pathway. Collectively, this study showed that DLBCL-derived exosomes could promote macrophages transformation to protumor M2-like phenotype in the tumor microenvironment.	2022	01	14	Chem Biol Interact	Ling	Hua Yu
34932207	10.1007/s40265-021-01657-0	Current Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: The Diminishing Role of Chemoimmunotherapy.	In this review, we examine the literature supporting treatment decision making in the front-line and relapsed/refractory settings for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the front-line setting, novel-agent-based approaches, including continuous Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor-based therapy and time-limited venetoclax with obinutuzumab, have demonstrated survival benefit over chemoimmunotherapy. While novel-agent-based front-line approaches are appropriate for most patients, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) remains a consideration for a selected population of young patients with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV)-mutated disease because of the possibility of a prolonged remission following FCR. As front-line novel-agent-based approaches have not been compared directly, decision making regarding which novel-agent-based approach to use in the front-line setting is often based on comorbidities and shared decision making. In the relapsed/refractory setting, BTK inhibitors, venetoclax-based therapy, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have demonstrated survival benefit when compared with chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Data to support various treatment sequences are limited, which highlights the need for prospective data to examine the optimal treatment sequence. Finally, we examine therapies with combinations of novel agents, and novel agents in development, including covalent and noncovalent BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors, immunotherapies, and cellular therapies. With effective approved options and new agents in development, the role of chemoimmunotherapy in the management of CLL has diminished.	2022	03	21	Drugs	Roeker	Lindsey E
34932406	10.1139/cjpp-2021-0596	Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis enhances monocyte infiltration and adverse cardiac remodeling in diabetic animals.	Diabetic cancer patients were treated with doxorubicin (DOX), a potent chemotherapeutic drug that induces cardiac toxicity; however, molecular mechanisms of cardiac toxicity in this specific disease progression in patients and animal models are completely unknown. Therefore, we designed a study to understand the effects of DOX-induced cardiac toxicity in diabetic animals and the involved pathophysiological mechanisms. C57BL/6 J mice were divided into four DOX- and diabetic (streptozotocin; STZ) - treated groups; control, STZ, DOX, and DOX+STZ. At day 14, animals were sacrificed, echocardiography was used to examine heart function, and heart and blood samples were collected to investigate apoptotic mechanisms (caspase 3, BAX, B-Cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)), inflammation, and cardiac remodeling. Our data shows a significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) increase in glucose levels, apoptotic markers, and monocyte infiltration at the site of apoptosis and triggered inflammatory immune response (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)), in DOX+STZ animals compared with control and experimental groups. We also observed significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) increase in myofibrillar area, fibrosis, and significantly decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) cardiac function in DOX-treated diabetic animals compared with controls. In conclusion, our data suggest that DOX induces significantly increased apoptosis, fibrosis, and structural alterations in diabetic hearts compared with non-diabetic animals.	2022	04	28	Can J Physiol Pharmacol	Aluganti Narasimhulu	Chandrakala
34932839	10.1111/and.14348	Explore the effects of pulmonary fibrosis on sperm quality and the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway based on rat model.	Researches were reported that respiratory diseases can lead to male infertility; however, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and male infertility. This study examined the influence of PF on sperm quality and its mechanisms. The key signalling pathway of male infertility caused by PF was predicted based on bioinformatics research. After modelling, we evaluated semen quality. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to measure the protein and mRNA expression levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylation-protein kinase B (p-Akt) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) in rat testicular cells. Compared with group A (48.77 ± 4.67; 59.77 ± 4.79), the sperm concentration and total sperm viability of group B (8.44 ± 1.71; 15.39 ± 3.48) showed a downward trend (p &lt; 0.05). Western blotting showed that the protein expressions of PI3K, p-Akt and Bcl2 in the testes of group B (0.30 ± 0.06; 0.27 ± 0.05; 0.15 ± 0.03) was significantly lower than those of group A (0.71 ± 0.07; 0.72 ± 0.06; 0.50 ± 0.06) (p &lt; 0.05). The hypoxic environment induced by PF can inhibit the expression of PI3K, p-Akt and Bcl2 protein and eventually cause dysfunctional spermatogenesis.	2022	03	09	Andrologia	Wang	Ji-Sheng
34937946	10.1038/s41586-021-04244-1	Valine tRNA levels and availability regulate complex I assembly in leukaemia.	Although deregulation of transfer RNA (tRNA) biogenesis promotes the translation of pro-tumorigenic mRNAs in cancers<sup>1,2</sup>, the mechanisms and consequences of tRNA deregulation in tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to focus on genes that have been implicated in tRNA biogenesis, and identify a mechanism by which altered valine tRNA biogenesis enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Expression of valine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is transcriptionally upregulated by NOTCH1, a key oncogene in T-ALL, underlining a role for oncogenic transcriptional programs in coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Limiting valine bioavailability through restriction of dietary valine intake disrupted this balance in mice, resulting in decreased leukaemic burden and increased survival in vivo. Mechanistically, valine restriction reduced translation rates of mRNAs that encode subunits of mitochondrial complex I, leading to defective assembly of complex I and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in differential valine conditions identified several genes, including SLC7A5 and BCL2, whose genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition synergized with valine restriction to reduce T-ALL growth.

The prognostic role of TP53 disruption has been established in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Aim of this analysis was to correlate TP53 mutations by Sanger sequencing, cell of origin (COO) profile by Lymph2Cx panel on the NanoString platform and MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 overexpression or re-arrangements by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), with outcome in DLBCL patients enrolled into the FIL-DLCL04 trial (NCT00499018). One hundred and twenty-five DLBCL patients with tumour block available were analyzed. TP53 was mutated in 11/125 (9%) cases; 60/125 patients received high-dose chemoimmunotherapy up-front, as for the randomization arm; COO was reported in 88 patients: 48 germinal centre B-cell like, 25 activated B-cell like and 17 unclassified; 26 patients were double expressors in IHC and 11 double hit in FISH. After a median follow-up of 72 months, five-year failure-free survival (FFS) for TP53 mutated versus wild-type was 24% and 72%, and five-year overall survival (OS) was 34% and 83%, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 2·28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·89-5·86, p = 0·086] and 4·05 (95% CI 1·37-11·97, p = 0·011) for FFS and OS, respectively. In this series of young DLBCL patients, TP53 gene mutation identified a poor prognosis subgroup, regardless of treatment and other biological markers.	2022	03	10	Br J Haematol	Chiappella	Annalisa
34957565	10.1002/path.5861	Widespread in situ follicular neoplasia in patients who subsequently developed follicular lymphoma.	In situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN) is usually an occasional incidental finding in lymph nodes by BCL2 immunohistochemistry, and its true scale is unknown. We have identified six cases of follicular lymphoma (FL) with a history of solid neoplasm 4-16 years ago, from which ISFN was identified widely in the surgically cleared lymph nodes (LNs). Using clone-specific PCR and BaseScope in situ hybridisation with primers or probes specific to the VDJ or BCL2-IGHJ junction sequence, we confirmed the clonal identity among different ISFNs and overt-FL in each of the four cases successfully investigated. Mutation analyses of overt-FL by targeted next-generation sequencing identified multiple potential pathogenic changes involving CREBBP, EZH2, KMT2D, TNFRS14, and STAT6. Further investigations of these mutations in paired ISFNs using Fluidigm PCR and Illumina sequencing showed the presence of the FL-associated mutations in early lesions for two of the six cases investigated (CREBBP and KMT2D in one case and STAT6 in the other), with one case displaying stepwise accumulation of its observed mutations. Remarkably, there were considerable divergences in BCL2 variants among different ISFN-involved lymph nodes in all four cases successfully investigated, indicating ongoing intraclonal diversification by somatic hypermutation machinery. Our findings demonstrate widespread distribution of ISFN lesions, further implicating their dynamic nature with the neoplastic cells undergoing active trafficking and clonal evolution. © 2021 The Authors.

34967008	10.1111/bjh.17990	The molecular ontogeny of follicular lymphoma: gene mutations succeeding the BCL2 translocation define common precursor cells.	Relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) can arise from common progenitor cells (CPCs). Conceptually, CPC-defining mutations are somatic alterations shared by the initial and relapsed tumours, mostly B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2)/immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH) translocations and other recurrent gene mutations. Through complementary approaches for highly sensitive mutation detection, we do not find CPC-defining mutations in highly purified BCL2/IGH-negative haematopoietic progenitor cells in clinical remission samples from three patients with relapsed FL. Instead, we find cells harbouring the same BCL2/IGH translocation but lacking CREB binding protein (CREBBP), lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and other recurrent gene mutations. Thus, (i) the BCL2/IGH translocation can precede CPC-defining mutations in human FL, and (ii) BCL2/IGH-translocated cells can persist in clinical remission.	2022	04	20	Br J Haematol	Haebe	Sarah
34980601	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-2949	Genetic Subtyping and Phenotypic Characterization of the Immune Microenvironment and MYC/BCL2 Double Expression Reveal Heterogeneity in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is molecularly and clinically heterogeneous, and can be subtyped according to genetic alterations, cell-of-origin, or microenvironmental signatures using high-throughput genomic data at the DNA or RNA level. Although high-throughput proteomic profiling has not been available for DLBCL subtyping, MYC/BCL2 protein double expression (DE) is an established prognostic biomarker in DLBCL. The purpose of this study is to reveal the relative prognostic roles of DLBCL genetic, phenotypic, and microenvironmental biomarkers. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing; IHC for MYC, BCL2, and FN1; and fluorescent multiplex IHC for microenvironmental markers in a large cohort of DLBCL. We performed correlative and prognostic analyses within and across DLBCL genetic subtypes and MYC/BCL2 double expressors. We found that MYC/BCL2 double-high-expression (DhE) had significant adverse prognostic impact within the EZB genetic subtype and LymphGen-unclassified DLBCL cases but not within MCD and ST2 genetic subtypes. Conversely, KMT2D mutations significantly stratified DhE but not non-DhE DLBCL. T-cell infiltration showed favorable prognostic effects within BN2, MCD, and DhE but unfavorable effects within ST2 and LymphGen-unclassified cases. FN1 and PD-1-high expression had significant adverse prognostic effects within multiple DLBCL genetic/phenotypic subgroups. The prognostic effects of DhE and immune biomarkers within DLBCL genetic subtypes were independent although DhE and high Ki-67 were significantly associated with lower T-cell infiltration in LymphGen-unclassified cases. Together, these results demonstrated independent and additive prognostic effects of phenotypic MYC/BCL2 and microenvironment biomarkers and genetic subtyping in DLBCL prognostication, important for improving DLBCL classification and identifying prognostic determinants and therapeutic targets.	2022	04	15	Clin Cancer Res	Xu-Monette	Zijun Y
34984584	10.1007/s12035-021-02675-5	Bax Contributes to Retinal Ganglion Cell Dendritic Degeneration During Glaucoma.	The BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) family of proteins contributes to mitochondrial-based apoptosis in models of neurodegeneration, including glaucomatous optic neuropathy (glaucoma), which degrades the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axonal projection to the visual brain. Glaucoma is commonly associated with increased sensitivity to intraocular pressure (IOP) and involves a proximal program that leads to RGC dendritic pruning and a distal program that underlies axonopathy in the optic projection. While genetic deletion of the Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax<sup>-/-</sup>) prolongs RGC body survival in models of glaucoma and optic nerve trauma, axonopathy persists, thus raising the question of whether dendrites and the RGC light response are protected. Here, we used an inducible model of glaucoma in Bax<sup>-/-</sup> mice to determine if Bax contributes to RGC dendritic degeneration. We performed whole-cell recordings and dye filling in RGCs signaling light onset (αON-Sustained) and offset (αOFF-Sustained). We recovered RGC dendritic morphologies by confocal microscopy and analyzed dendritic arbor complexity and size. Additionally, we assessed RGC axon function by measuring anterograde axon transport of cholera toxin subunit B to the superior colliculus and behavioral spatial frequency threshold (i.e., spatial acuity). We found 1 month of IOP elevation did not cause significant RGC death in either WT or Bax<sup>-/-</sup> retinas. However, IOP elevation reduced dendritic arbor complexity of WT αON-Sustained and αOFF-Sustained RGCs. In the absence of Bax, αON- and αOFF-Sustained RGC dendritic arbors remained intact following IOP elevation. In addition to dendrites, neuroprotection by Bax<sup>-/-</sup> generalized to αON-and αOFF-Sustained RGC light- and current-evoked responses. Both anterograde axon transport and spatial acuity declined during IOP elevation in WT and Bax<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, our results indicate Bax contributes to RGC dendritic degeneration and distinguishes the proximal and distal neurodegenerative programs involved during the progression of glaucoma.	2022	04	07	Mol Neurobiol	Risner	Michael L
34990302	10.1080/21655979.2021.2017590	Propofol induces the apoptosis of neural stem cells via microRNA-9-5p / chemokine CXC receptor 4 signaling pathway.	Recent studies suggested that propofol, one of the most widely used anesthetics, may cause neurotoxicity in the developing brain, leading to cognitive deficits in adults. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of propofol neurotoxicity in the neural stem cells (NSCs). The mRNA and protein expression levels of microRNA-9-5p (miR-9-5p) and chemokine CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 and Hoechst staining kits. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein, and caspase-3 were detected by Western blotting analysis. These results confirmed that propofol activated cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. A significant increase in the miR-9-5p and CXCR4 expression was observed in the propofol-treated cells. The overexpression of miR-9-5p induced apoptosis in NSCs, accompanied by elevated apoptosis-related protein activity. Furthermore, mitigated CXCR4 expression reduced propofol-induced cell apoptosis. We conclude that propofol induces cell death in NSCs, and overexpression of miR-9-5p/CXCR4 contributes to propofol-induced cell apoptosis, which might be a target for developing novel strategies to treat propofol neurotoxicity.	2022	02	23	Bioengineered	Zhang	Weixin
34994825	10.1007/s00210-021-02175-2	Diacerein ameliorates induced polycystic ovary in female rats via modulation of inflammasome/caspase1/IL1β and Bax/Bcl2 pathways.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common gynecological disease during childbearing period and markedly affects female fertility. Until now, there are no studies evaluating the possible curative effect of diacerein (DIA) in induced PCOS. For the first time, we aimed in current model to study the effect of DIA (50 mg/kg/day) orally for 3 weeks on experimentally induced PCOS by letrozole (1 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. We measured rats' body weight changes, levels of serum insulin, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), testosterone, inflammasome, caspase1, and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC). Moreover, we measured ovarian tissue parameters as malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin 1β (IL1β), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) of Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), and interleukin 10 (IL10) gene expression changes. Furthermore, histopathological features and anti-apoptotic marker B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) immunoexpression changes were evaluated. Our results showed that letrozole markedly induced PCOS as manifested by significant increase in serum testosterone, insulin, AMH, rats' body weights, ovarian tissue MDA, IL1β, inflammasome, and caspase1 but decrease of serum TAC. In addition, gene expression of Bax increased but IL10 gene expression decreased. Ovaries showed the typical histopathological changes of PCOS with no immunoexpression of Bcl2. DIA was greatly able to ameliorate letrozole-induced PCOS changes in rats mainly via prevention of IL1β, and improving metabolic disturbances, and its anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects with further regulation of inflammasome/caspase1/IL1β and Bax/Bcl2 pathways.	2022	03	09	Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol	Refaie	Marwa M M
34994930	10.1007/s11356-021-18399-x	Histopathological, Immunohistochemical, And Molecular Alterations In Brain Tissue And Submandibular Salivary Gland Of Atrazine-Induced Toxicity In Male Rats.	Atrazine (ATZ) is herbicide that has been widely used for different crops. This extensive use has resulted in severe deleterious effects in different species. In this work, we investigated the potentially harmful effect of atrazine herbicide on the brain and submandibular salivary gland. Our investigation was carried out on 20 adult male albino rats that were equally divided into two groups. The first group received distilled water as control, while the second group received ATZ at 200 mg/kg body weight/ day via stomach gavage for 30 successive days of the experiment; the oral LD50 for ATZ is 3090 mg/kg. Our findings revealed the ability of ATZ to cause damage to the cerebrum, hippocampus, and submandibular salivary gland. This damage resulted from the induced oxidative stress, which was indicated by a significant elevation in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, DNA fragmentation, tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-α) expression, with a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and reduction of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (Creb1) genes expression after ATZ exposure. Moreover, degeneration of cells, cytoplasmic vacuolation, congestion of blood vessels, a strong immune reaction to caspase 3, and negligible immune expression of a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also noticed in the ATZ-treated group. We concluded that ATZ induces oxidative stress and has a toxic and apoptotic effects on the cerebrum, hippocampus, and salivary gland of adult male albino rats.	2022	04	13	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Ahmed	Yasmine H
34994989	10.1002/jcla.24227	Association of B-cell lymphoma 2/microRNA-497 gene expression ratio score with metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer: A propensity-matched cohort analysis.	Deregulated microRNAs (miRs) significantly impact cancer development and progression. Our in silico analysis revealed that miR-497 and its target gene B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) could be related to poor cancer outcomes. To investigate the BCL2/miRNA-497 expression ratio in colorectal cancer (CRC) and explore its association with the clinicopathological characteristics and CRC prognosis. Archived samples from 106 CRC patients were enrolled. MiR-497 and BCL2 gene expressions were detected by Taq-Man Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in propensity-matched metastatic and nonmetastatic cohorts after elimination of confounder bias. B-cell lymphoma-2 gene was upregulated in metastatic samples (median = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.09-1.60) compared to nonmetastatic (median = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.89-1.25, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, lower levels of miR-495 were detected in specimens with distant metastasis (median = 0.05, 95%CI = 0.04-0.20) than nonmetastatic samples (median = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.47-0.58, p &lt; 0.001). Estimated BCL2/miR-497 ratio yielded a significant differential expression between the two cohort groups. Higher scores were observed in metastasis group (median = 1.39, 95%CI = 0.9-1.51) than nonmetastatic patients (median = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.19-0.39, p &lt; 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed BCL2/miR-497 ratio score to have the highest predictive accuracy for metastasis at presentation. The area under the curve was 0.90 (95%CI = 0.839-0.964, p &lt; 0.001) at cut-off of &gt;0.525, with high sensitivity 81.1% (95%CI = 68.6%-89.4%) and specificity 92.5% (95%CI = 82.1%-97.0%). Also, the ratio score was negatively correlated with disease-free survival (r = -0.676, p &lt; 0.001) and overall survival times (r = -0.650, p &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower survival rates in cohorts with high-score compared to low-score patients. The BCL2/miR497 expression ratio is associated with poor CRC prognosis in terms of metastasis and short survival.	2022	04	01	J Clin Lab Anal	Kattan	Shahad W
34999394	10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108497	Venetoclax enhances NK cell killing sensitivity of AML cells through the NKG2D/NKG2DL activation pathway.	Venetoclax, a selective B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) inhibitor, has a potential therapeutic effect when combined with demethylating agents in the first-line setting of unfit elderly patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML); however, efficacy is still limited in refractory/recurrent AML. Therefore, exploration of a suitable novel treatment scheme is urgently needed.However, combining venetoclax with NK cell-based immunotherapy has not been studied. The cytotoxicity of NK cell combined with venetoclax was assessed in vitro using flow cytometry. Venetoclax-induced natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligand (NKG2DL) expression was detected by flow cytometry and western blotting. Mechanisms underlying venetoclax-induced NKG2DL expression were found by GSE127200 analysis and investigated using real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and western blotting. Flow cytometric analysis showed that combining venetoclax with NK cells produced synergistic anti-leukaemia effects similar to those of venetoclax + azacitidine. Venetoclax could render AML cell lines and primary AML cells sensitive to NK cell killing by promoting NK cell degranulation, NK-AML cell recognition and NK cell secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and granzyme B. The synergistic effect resulted from venetoclax-induced NKG2DL upregulation in AML cells and could be undermined by blocking NKG2D on NK cells. This finding suggests that venetoclax enhances NK cell killing activity by activating the NKG2D/NKG2DL ligand-receptor pathway. Furthermore, the nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB) signalling pathway was involved in venetoclax-induced NKG2DL upregulation. Collectively, our data confirm that venetoclax combined with NK cells induces synergistic AML cell cytolysis and preliminarily revealed that venetoclax could selectively induce NKG2DLs on AML cells via NFKB signalling pathway.	2022	03	31	Int Immunopharmacol	Wu	Hui-Yang
35007655	10.1016/j.dci.2022.104349	SpBAG3 assisted WSSV infection in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) by inhibiting apoptosis.	The function of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins can be divided into two categories: anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic. As an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) plays a key role in regulating apoptosis, development, cell movement, and autophagy, and mediating the adaptability of cells to stimulation. However, SpBAG3 has not been reported in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain), and the regulatory effect of SpBAG3 on apoptosis in mud crab and its function in antiviral immunity is still unknown. In this study, SpBAG3 was found, and characterized, which encoded a total of 175 amino acid (molecular mass 19.3 kDa), including a specific conserved domain of the BAG family. SpBAG3 was significantly down-regulated at 0-48 h post-infection with WSSV in vivo. The antiviral effect of SpBAG3 was investigated using RNA interference. The results indicated that SpBAG3 might be involved in assisting the replication of WSSV in the host. SpBAG3 could change the mitochondrial membrane potential (△ψm), and affect cell apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Therefore, the results of this study suggested that SpBAG3 could assist WSSV infection by inhibiting the apoptosis of the hemocytes in mud crab.	2022	03	31	Dev Comp Immunol	Liu	Ting
35013138	10.1038/s41420-021-00622-w	Knockdown of NRMT enhances sensitivity of retinoblastoma cells to cisplatin through upregulation of the CENPA/Myc/Bcl2 axis.	Chemotherapy resistance of tumor cells causes failure in anti-tumor therapies. Recently, N-terminal regulator of chromatin condensation 1 methyltransferase (NRMT) is abnormally expressed in different cancers. Hence, we speculate that NRMT may pay a crucial role in the development of chemosensitivity in retinoblastoma. We characterized the upregulation of NRMT in the developed cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant retinoblastoma cell line relative to parental cells. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that NRMT silencing enhanced chemosensitivity of retinoblastoma cells to CDDP. Next, NRMT was identified to enrich histone-H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in the promoter of centromere protein A (CENPA) by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Rescue experiments suggested that CENPA reduced chemosensitivity by increasing the viability and proliferation and reducing apoptosis of CDDP-resistant retinoblastoma cells, which was reversed by NRMT. Subsequently, CENPA was witnessed to induce the transcription of Myc and to elevate the expression of B cell lymphoma-2. At last, in vivo experiments confirmed the promotive effect of NRMT knockdown on chemosensitivity of retinoblastoma cells to CDDP in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, NRMT is an inhibitor of chemosensitivity in retinoblastoma. Those findings shed new light on NRMT-targeted therapies for retinoblastoma.	2022	01	21	Cell Death Discov	Li	Zhongrui
35028710	10.1007/s00428-021-03265-5	Cell-of-origin classification using the Hans and Lymph2Cx algorithms in primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphomas.	Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL-LT) and primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma with a diffuse population of large cells (PCFCL-LC) are both primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas with large-cell morphology (CLBCL) but with different clinical characteristics and behavior. In systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS), gene-expression profiling (GEP) revealed two molecular subgroups based on their cell-of-origin (COO) with prognostic significance: the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype and the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype. This study investigated whether COO classification is a useful tool for classification of CLBCL. For this retrospective study, 51 patients with PCDLBCL-LT and 15 patients with PCFCL-LC were analyzed for their COO according to the immunohistochemistry-based Hans algorithm and the NanoString GEP-based Lymph2Cx algorithm. In PCFCL-LC, all cases (100%) classified as GCB by both Hans and Lymph2Cx. In contrast, COO classification in PCDLBCL-LT was heterogeneous. Using Hans, 75% of the PCDLBCL-LT patients classified as non-GCB and 25% as GCB, while Lymph2Cx classified only 18% as ABC, 43% as unclassified/intermediate, and 39% as GCB. These COO subgroups did not differ in the expression of BCL2 and IgM, mutations in MYD88 and/or CD79B, loss of CDKN2A, or survival. In conclusion, PCFCL-LC uniformly classified as GCB, while PCDLBCL-LT classified along the COO spectrum of DLBCL-NOS using the Hans and Lymph2Cx algorithms. In contrast to DLBCL-NOS, the clinical relevance of COO classification in CLBCL using these algorithms has limitations and cannot be used as an alternative for the current multiparameter approach in differentiation of PCDLBCL-LT and PCFCL-LC.	2022	04	11	Virchows Arch	Schrader	Anne M R
35030632	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006410	Distinct clinical and genetic features of hepatitis B virus-associated follicular lymphoma in Chinese patients.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with an increased risk for B-cell lymphomas. We previously showed that 20% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients from China, an endemic area of HBV infection, have chronic HBV infection (surface antigen-positive, HBsAg+) and are characterized by distinct clinical and genetic features. Here, we showed that 24% of follicular lymphoma (FL) Chinese patients are HBsAg+. Compared with the HBsAg- FL patients, HBsAg+ patients are younger, have a higher histological grade at diagnosis, and have a higher incidence of disease progression within 24 months. Moreover, by sequencing the genomes of 109 FL tumors, we observed enhanced mutagenesis and distinct genetic profile in HBsAg+ FLs, with a unique set of preferentially mutated genes (TNFAIP3, FAS, HIST1H1C, KLF2, TP53, PIM1, TMSB4X, DUSP2, TAGAP, LYN, and SETD2) but lack of the hallmark of HBsAg- FLs (ie, IGH/BCL2 translocations and CREBBP mutations). Transcriptomic analyses further showed that HBsAg+ FLs displayed gene-expression signatures resembling the activated B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, involving IRF4-targeted genes and NF-κB/MYD88 signaling pathways. Finally, we identified an increased infiltration of CD8+ memory T cells, CD4+ Th1 cells, and M1 macrophages and higher T-cell exhaustion gene signature in HBsAg+ FL samples. Taken together, we present new genetic/epigenetic evidence that links chronic HBV infection to B-cell lymphomagenesis, and HBV-associated FL is likely to have a distinct cell-of-origin and represent as a separate subtype of FL. Targetable genetic/epigenetic alterations identified in tumors and their associated tumor microenvironment may provide potential novel therapeutic approaches for this subgroup of patients.	2022	05	06	Blood Adv	Ren	Weicheng
35036912	10.1177/2632010X211070774	Rare but Potentially Fatal Presentations of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Leukemic Phase or Hemophagocytic Syndrome in Bone Marrow.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma commonly presenting as a solid tumor either by nodal or extra-nodal manifestations. Here we describe two atypical presentations of lymphoma, finally resulting in the diagnosis of DLBCL. Case 1: A 53-year-old man with a previous history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma presented with a two-week history of B-symptoms and hyperleukocytosis. Peripheral blood film showed 78% abnormal mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical stain showing Ki-67 of 90%, negative c-myc, BCL2 and BCL6, and negative c-MYC with fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies on the trephine biopsy, concluded the diagnosis of CD5+ DLBCL of ABC subtype. He received intravenous cyclophosphamide and oral prednisolone for cytoreduction, followed by 6 cycles of chemo-immunotherapy. However, he succumbed due to severe sepsis after the completion of therapy. Case 2: A 56-year-old lady who was initially investigated for pyrexia of unknown origin was noted to have hemophagocytosis upon bone marrow aspirate examination. The bone marrow trephine biopsy revealed some atypical clusters of B-cells positive for CD20 which was inconclusive. PET-CT scan noted an enlarged hypermetabolic spleen without lymphadenopathy. Splenic biopsy with immunohistochemical studies revealed DLBCL of ABC subtype. The diagnosis was consistent with primary splenic DLBCL. She became unwell post splenic biopsy and was admitted to the intensive care unit where she passed away 2 weeks later from Candida and Sternotrophomonas septicemia. These cases highlight the atypical presentations of a common subtype of NHL in our center. Arriving at the definitive diagnosis can be difficult especially when patients are acutely ill, hampering the necessary invasive procedures for diagnosis. The outcomes of both cases are briefly discussed hoping to spread awareness among clinicians on the rare and acutely critical presentations of DLBCL.	2022	02	18	Clin Pathol	Wan Mohd Zohdi	Wan Awatif
35044826	10.1126/sciadv.abl4644	Preneoplastic somatic mutations including <i>MYD88</i><sup>L265P</sup> in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.	Normal cell counterparts of solid and myeloid tumors accumulate mutations years before disease onset; whether this occurs in B lymphocytes before lymphoma remains uncertain. We sequenced multiple stages of the B lineage in elderly individuals and patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, a singular disease for studying lymphomagenesis because of the high prevalence of mutated <i>MYD88</i>. We observed similar accumulation of random mutations in B lineages from both cohorts and unexpectedly found <i>MYD88</i><sup>L265P</sup> in normal precursor and mature B lymphocytes from patients with lymphoma. We uncovered genetic and transcriptional pathways driving malignant transformation and leveraged these to model lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in mice, based on mutated <i>MYD88</i> in B cell precursors and <i>BCL2</i> overexpression. Thus, <i>MYD88</i><sup>L265P</sup> is a preneoplastic event, which challenges the current understanding of lymphomagenesis and may have implications for early detection of B cell lymphomas.	2022	04	19	Sci Adv	Rodriguez	Sara
35045798	10.1080/10428194.2021.2024821	High grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC</i>, <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements: unraveling the genetic landscape of a rare aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	High-grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements (DH/TH-HGBL) still miss an in-depth genomic characterization. To identify accompanying genetic events, we performed a pilot study on 7 cases by applying DNA microarray and targeted NGS sequencing. Interestingly, the genetic background of DH/TH-HGBL is largely overlapping with that of other high-grade/poor prognosis lymphomas. Namely, copy number abnormalities were trisomy of chromosome 7 and chromosome 8q gain, encompassing <i>MYC</i>. Among gene variants, those affecting transcription factors (<i>MYC, FOXO1</i>), epigenetic modulators (<i>KMT2D</i>, <i>EZH2</i> and <i>CREEBP</i>), and anti-apoptotic gene (<i>BCL2</i>), were recurrent. <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> were mutated in 3 and 5 cases, respectively. In addition, mutations of <i>FOXO1,</i> previously reported in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas, were also detected. Clarifying the genomic background of this subset of high-risk lymphomas will pave the way for the clinical use of new biomarkers to: (1) monitor treatment response and; (2) consider alternative targeted therapies.	2022	06	02	Leuk Lymphoma	Ferrari	Anna

T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and has been reported as an molecular mechanism of allergic diseases. This study aimed to explore the effects of anti-TIM-1 monoclonal antibodies (anti-TIM1) on the development of allergic asthma. Female C57BL/6 mice were induced and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and received subsequent intranasal administration of anti-TIM1. The airway resistance of all mice was evaluated using a Buxco PFT system. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of TIM-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The level of cytokine production in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and serum was determined using ELISA. Mucous cells were observed using Alcian blue and periodic acid-Schiff staining. In addition, B-cell lymphoma gene 2(BCL2), T-box transcription factor (T-bet), GATA binding protein-3(GATA3), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT6 were analyzed by western blot analysis. Their corresponding mRNA expression levels were determined by quantitative PCR. The mRNA expression level of Mucin 5AC in the lung tissues was also detected using quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the intranasal administration of anti-TIM1 ameliorated airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in an acute model of asthma. Following administration of anti-TIM1, both the mRNA and protein levels of T-bet were upregulated, while those of BCL2 and GATA3 were downregulated. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 and STAT6 were increased. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that intranasal administration of anti-TIM1 ameliorated allergic lung inflammation and remodeling in mouse models of asthma by repairing both the STAT1 and STAT6 pathways.	2022	04	08	Pharmazie	Qiang	Lixia
35046056	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-3617	First-in-Human Dose-Escalation Study of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9 Inhibitor VIP152 in Patients with Advanced Malignancies Shows Early Signs of Clinical Efficacy.	To report on the first-in-human phase I study of VIP152 (NCT02635672), a potent and highly selective cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitor. Adults with solid tumors or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma who were refractory to or had exhausted all available therapies received VIP152 monotherapy as a 30-minute intravenous, once-weekly infusion, as escalating doses (5, 10, 15, 22.5, or 30 mg in 21-day cycles) until the MTD was determined. Thirty-seven patients received ≥ 1 VIP152 dose, with 30 mg identified as the MTD based on dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3/4 neutropenia. The most common adverse events were nausea and vomiting (75.7% and 56.8%, respectively), all of grade 1/2 severity. Of the most common events, grade 3/4 events occurring in &gt; 1 patient were neutropenia (22%), anemia (11%), abdominal pain (8%), increased alkaline phosphatase (8%), and hyponatremia (8%). Day 1 exposure for the MTD exceeded the predicted minimum therapeutic exposure and reproducibly achieved maximal pathway modulation; no accumulation occurred after multiple doses. Seven of 30 patients with solid tumors had stable disease (including 9.5 and 16.8 months in individual patients with pancreatic cancer and salivary gland cancer, respectively), and 2 of 7 patients with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2/BCL6 translocations (HGL) achieved durable complete metabolic remission (ongoing at study discontinuation, after 3.7 and 2.3 years of treatment). VIP152 monotherapy, administered intravenously once weekly, demonstrated a favorable safety profile and evidence of clinical benefit in patients with advanced HGL and solid tumors.	2022	04	11	Clin Cancer Res	Diamond	Jennifer R
35053500	10.3390/cancers14020338	High ETV6 Levels Support Aggressive B Lymphoma Cell Survival and Predict Poor Outcome in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patients.	The identification of prognostic factors for aggressive B-cell lymphomas still represents an unmet clinical need. We used forward phase protein arrays (FFPA) to identify proteins associated with overall survival (OS) from diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients (<i>n</i> = 47). Univariate Cox regression analysis identified numerous proteins, including immune check-point molecules (PDCD1, PDCD2 and PD1L2) and BCL2 to be significantly associated with OS. However, only ETV6 and PIM2 proteins persisted following multivariate Cox analysis. Independent validation studies by immunohistochemistry and analysis of public gene expression profiles of DLBCL confirmed a prognostic role for high ETV6 and ETV6/PIM2 ratios in DLBCL. <i>ETV6</i> is a recurrently mutated/deleted gene in DLBCL for which its function in this disease entity is currently unknown. We find that ETV6 is upregulated during oncogenic transformation of germinal center B-cells and that it regulates DLBCL survival, as its acute loss results in marked apoptosis. Fluctuations in survivin (BIRC5) expression levels were associated with this phenomenon. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between ETV6 and BIRC5 expression levels was found and correlated with a response to the BIRC5 inhibitor, YM155. In conclusion, we present evidence for an oncogenic function of ETV6 in DLBCL.	2022	01	28	Cancers (Basel)	Marino	Dario
35058488	10.1038/s41598-022-04916-6	Inhibition of MCL1 induces apoptosis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and in primary effusion lymphoma.	Overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL2 family proteins occurs in various hematologic malignancies and contributes to tumorigenesis by inhibiting the apoptotic machinery of the cells. Antagonizing BH3 mimetics provide an option for medication, with venetoclax as the first drug applied for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and for acute myeloid leukemia. To find additional hematologic entities with ectopic expression of BCL2 family members, we performed expression screening of cell lines applying the LL-100 panel. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), 2/22 entities covered by this panel, stood out by high expression of MCL1 and low expression of BCL2. The MCL1 inhibitor AZD-5991 induced apoptosis in cell lines from both malignancies, suggesting that this BH3 mimetic might be efficient as drug for these diseases. The ALCL cell lines also expressed BCLXL and BCL2A1, both contributing to survival of the cells. The combination of specific BH3 mimetics yielded synergistic effects, pointing to a novel strategy for the treatment of ALCL. The PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ-235 could also efficiently be applied in combination with AZD-5991, offering an alternative to avoid thrombocytopenia which is associated with the use of BCLXL inhibitors.	2022	03	01	Sci Rep	Quentmeier	Hilmar
35062067	10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112601	Genistein alleviates renin-angiotensin system mediated vascular and kidney alterations in renovascular hypertensive rats.	Genistein is a bioflavonoid mainly found in soybean. This study evaluated the effect of genistein on vascular dysfunction and kidney damage in two-kidney, one-clipped (2K1C) hypertensive rats. Male Sprague-Dawley-2K1C hypertensive rats were treated with genistein (40 or 80 mg/kg) or losartan 10 mg/kg (n = 8/group). Genistein reduced blood pressure, attenuated the increase in sympathetic nerve-mediated contractile response and endothelial dysfunction in the mesenteric vascular beds and aorta of 2K1C rats. Increases in the intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the mesentery and plasma norepinephrine (NE) were alleviated in the genistein-treated group. Genistein also improved renal dysfunction, hypertrophy of the non-clipped kidney (NCK) and atrophy of the clipped kidney (CK) in 2K1C rats. Upregulation of angiotensin II receptor type I (AT<sub>1</sub>R), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit 4 (Nox4) and Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX) and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein found in CK were restored by genistein. It also suppressed the overexpression of AT<sub>1</sub>R, transforming growth factor beta I (TGF-β1), smad2/3 and p-smad3 in NCK. Genistein reduced serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) in 2K1C rats. Low levels of catalase activity as well as high levels of superoxide generation and malondialdehyde (MDA) in 2K1C rats were restored by genistein treatment. In conclusion, genistein suppressed renin-angiotensin system-mediated sympathetic activation and oxidative stress in 2K1C rats. It alleviated renal atrophy in CK via modulation of AT<sub>1</sub>R/NADPH oxidase/Bcl-2/BAX pathways and hypertrophy in NCK via AT<sub>1</sub>R/TGF-β1/smad-dependent signalling pathways.	2022	03	16	Biomed Pharmacother	Poasakate	Anuson
35064305	10.1007/s00011-021-01535-1	MiR-21 participates in LPS-induced myocardial injury by targeting Bcl-2 and CDK6.	This study aimed to investigate the relationship between miR-21 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced myocardial injury and its molecular and regulatory mechanisms. We constructed LPS-mediated myocardial injury model using C57BL/6J mice and H9c2 cells. In-vivo, in-vitro, RIP and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine the effect of miR-21 on myocardial injury. In-vivo and in-vitro results showed that the expression of miR-21 was increased in LPS-treated H9c2 cells and myocardial tissues of mice, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α) and NF-κB pathway were activated in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. Besides, the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression levels decreased, while Bax and cleaved caspase 9 levels increased in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. Inhibition of miR-21 could suppress LPS-induced apoptosis, inflammatory reactions and NF-κB activation to attenuate LPS-induced myocardial injury in H9c2 cells, and effectively improve survival of mice with sepsis. Most importantly, Bcl-2 and CDK6 were found to be the direct target of miR-21 using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Further gain-of-function assay demonstrated that Bcl-2 or CDK6 over-expression promoted the protective effects of miR-21 inhibitor on LPS-mediated myocardial cells. Our findings revealed that the down-regulation or antagonism of miR-21 protects myocardial cells against LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation through up-regulating Bcl-2 and CDK6 expression, which provided a new insight for prevention and treatment of myocardial injury.	2022	03	31	Inflamm Res	Li	Yu
35067515	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001828	Composite Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma and Follicular Lymphoma: A Clinicopathologic Study of 22 Cases With Review of 27 Additional Cases in the Literature.	Composite classic Hodgkin lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (CHLFL) is a rare and poorly characterized entity. Herein, we report the clinicopathologic features of 22 cases of CHLFL from 3 institutions and we assess 27 additional cases reported in the literature. In our cohort (n=22), patients with CHLFL had a median age of 61 years and an equal male to female incidence. Most cases (95%) arose de novo with the remaining patients having a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CHLFL always involved lymph nodes (100%) and most cases (95%) revealed 2 distinct areas separately diagnostic for CHL and FL. The CHL component represented a variable proportion of the overall neoplasm (5% to 90%) and was either mixed cellularity (82%) or nodular sclerosis (18%) type. The Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells expressed CD30 (100%), PAX5 (100%), CD15 (62%), BCL6 (47%), BCL2 (29%), and EBER (25%), in a polymorphous inflammatory background typical of CHL. The FL component was low-grade in 55%, grade 3A in 36%, and grade 3B in 9% of cases. All 3 cases investigated by cytogenetic methods for a clonal relationship between the CHL and FL components were clonally related. These clinicopathologic features of our cohort are similar to those of cases reported in the literature. The 5-year overall survival in combined patients with CHLFL (n=49) was 48%, comparable to CHL but worse than FL in the elderly. In summary, CHLFL is a rare entity that most often occurs in older adults, involves lymph nodes, and most commonly presents de novo. In the small number of cases assessed, the CHL and FL components are usually clonally related suggesting that the CHL and FL components may share a common progenitor B-cell, likely a mutated germinal center B-cell.	2022	05	17	Am J Surg Pathol	Huang	Yuhua

Endothelial dysfunction is a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of vascular complications of diabetes. Herein, this study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) on diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. Diabetic models were established both in db/db mice and high glucose (HG)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, HUVECs were exposed to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) to induce endothelial cell damage. Following Sal B treatment, pathological changes of thoracic aorta were investigated by hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue (AB), elastic fiber, Masson, and reticular fiber staining. BCL2-associated X (BAX), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Beclin1, Parkin and PTEN Induced Kinase 1 (Pink1) expression was detected by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence in thoracic aorta, HG- and CCCP-induced HUVECs. Cell scratch test, MitoTracker Red CMXRos staining and Flou-4 AM staining were separately presented to detect migration, mitochondrial activity and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in HUVECs. Our results showed that Sal B significantly ameliorated hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance in db/db mice. Furthermore, it significantly alleviated diabetes-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction according to histopathology analysis. In diabetic thoracic aorta, HG- and CCCP-induced HUVECs, Sal B distinctly increased Bcl-2 expression and reduced BAX, Beclin1, Parkin and Pink1 expression, thereby protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis and mitophagy. Moreover, Sal B markedly enhanced migration, mitochondrial activity and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels both in HG- and CCCP-induced HUVECs. Collectively, Sal B exhibited a potential to improve diabetes-induced endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunction through down-regulating apoptosis and mitophagy of endothelial cells.<b>Abbreviations:</b> DM: diabetes mellitus; T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus; Sal B: Salvianolic acid B; HG: high glucose; FBG: fasting blood glucose; TC: total cholesterol; TG: triglycerides; LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; FINS: fasting insulin; HOMA-IR: homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance; QUICKI: quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index; H&amp;E: hematoxylin and eosin; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; IHC: immunohistochemistry; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone; FCM: flow cytometry; CCK-8: cell counting kit-8.	2022	02	21	Bioengineered	Xiang	Jie
35074718	10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.01.017	The opposite effects of VGLL1 and VGLL4 genes on granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis of hen ovarian prehierarchical follicles.	Transcription cofactors Vestigial like family (VGLL) members consisting of four homologs (VGLL1-4) are associated with cell growth and metastasis in mammals, among which VGLL1 gene has been documented to possess tumorigenic functions in various types of tumor, and VGLL4 acts as a new tumor suppressor; likewise several studies indicated that they potentially play a role in the regulation of ovary growth and function. However, the biological effects of chicken VGLL1 and VGLL4 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis of the granulosa cells (GCs) during ovarian follicle development remain unknown now. This study found that VGLL1 and VGLL4 genes present divergent expression patterns of the transcripts in the GCs of various sized prehierarchical follicles (PFs) before follicle selection. Specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was employed to elucidate the exact roles of VGLL1 and VGLL4 in regulating the PF development of the hen ovary. The results demonstrated that the mRNA expression levels of the steroidogenic-related enzyme steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) gene and the cell proliferation-related factors B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), and cyclin D1 (CCND1) genes were significantly down-regulated in the cells with VGLL1 silence but remarkably up-regulated in the cells lacking VGLL4. Whereas the expression level of the cell apoptosis biomarker caspase-3 (CASP3) transcript was noticeably enhanced in the GCs without VGLL1 but significantly decreased in the GCs deprived of VGLL4. Further results showed that the siRNA-mediated silence of VGLL1 caused a significant increase in apoptosis with a reduction in the proliferation of GCs. Nevertheless, knockdown of VGLL4 resulted in a remarkable decrement in apoptosis but a memorable augment in proliferation of the GCs. Taken together, this study proved that VGLL1 promotes cell proliferation and steroidogenesis but inhibits apoptosis. In contrast, VGLL4 stimulates GC apoptosis while suppressing the GC proliferation and steroidogenesis in the hen ovarian follicles. We conluded that VGLL1 and VGLL4 affect oppositely the ovarian prehierarchical follicle development by the different regulatory manner in the GC proliferation and apoptosis of chicken ovary.	2022	02	15	Theriogenology	Sun	Xue

35089437	10.1007/s00018-022-04139-y	A20 undermines alternative NF-κB activity and expression of anti-apoptotic genes in Helicobacter pylori infection.	A hallmark of infection by the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which colonizes the human gastric epithelium, is the simultaneous activation of the classical and alternative nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways, underlying inflammation and cell survival. Here, we report that the classical NF-κB target gene product A20 contributes to the negative regulation of alternative NF-κB signaling in gastric epithelial cells infected by H. pylori. Mechanistically, the de novo synthesized A20 protein interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) and thereby interferes with the association of TIFA with the NIK regulatory complex. We also show that alternative NF-κB activity contributes to the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, such as baculoviral IAP repeat containing 2 (BIRC2), BIRC3 and B-cell lymphoma 2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1) in gastric epithelial cells. Furthermore, the observed over-expression of RelB in human gastric biopsies with type B gastritis and RelB-dependent suppression of apoptotic cell death emphasize an important role of the alternative NF-κB pathway in H. pylori infection.	2022	02	07	Cell Mol Life Sci	Lim	Michelle C C
35132478	10.1007/s11064-022-03545-9	Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived Exosomes Promote Neurological Function Recovery in a Rat Spinal Cord Injury Model.	Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to personal and social-economic consequences with limited therapeutic options. Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) have been explored as a promising alternative to cell therapies. In the current study, we explored the mechanism of hUC-MSC derived exosome's ameliorative effect on the spinal cord injury by combining data from in vivo contusion SCI model and in vitro cell viability of PC12 cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Intravenous administration of hUC-MSC derived exosomes dramatically improved motor function of Sprague-Dawley rats after SCI, with reduced apoptosis demonstrated by increased expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), decreased BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), and reduced cleaved caspase 9. Conversely, exosome treatment reduced the transcription levels of astrocytes marker GFAP and microglia marker IBA1, suggesting a reduced inflammatory state from SCI injury. Furthermore, exosome treatment in vitro increased the cell viability of PC12 cells. Exosome application activated the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in the spinal cord. Our study demonstrated that hUC-MSC derived exosomes could improve motor function through anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory effects. BCL2/Bax and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways were involved in the SCI process and could potentially mediate the protective effect of hUC-MSC derived exosomes.	2022	05	24	Neurochem Res	Kang	Jian
35141965	10.1111/ejn.15622	Sevoflurane protects mice from cerebral ischaemic injury by regulating microRNA-203-3p/HDAC4/Bcl-2 axis.	Sevoflurane (Sevo) is neuroprotective in ischaemic injury, but its specific mechanism in the disease from microRNA-203-3p/histone deacetylases 4/B-cell lymphoma 2 (miR-203-3p/HDAC4/Bcl-2) axis asks for a comprehensive explanation. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model was established by nylon suture method. miR-203-3p and HDAC4 expression was measured in mouse brain tissues. The MCAO mice were exposed to Sevo or injected with miR-203-3p- or HDAC4-related plasmids. In response to Sevo treatment or plasmid interference, neurological function, brain pathology, neuronal apoptosis and inflammation were determined. The interactions of miR-203-3p and HDAC4, and HDAC4 and Bcl-2 were verified. MCAO mice presented down-regulated miR-203-3p and up-regulated HDAC4. Sevo improved neurological function, brain pathological damage and reduced neuronal apoptosis and inflammation in MCAO mice, while overexpressing miR-203-3p further enhanced those effects. HDAC4 overexpression antagonized the impacts of miR-203-3p up-regulation on MCAO mice. The targeting relation existed between miR-203-3p and HDAC4, as well as between HDAC4 and Bcl-2. It is clearly elucidated that miR-203-3p enhances the protective effects of Sevo on MCAO mice through elevating Bcl-2 and down-regulating HDAC4, potentially and clinically offering an effective treatment method with Sevo for cerebral ischaemic injury.	2022	04	13	Eur J Neurosci	Song	Jie
35142981	10.1007/s11033-022-07203-9	Apoptosis induction in human lung and colon cancer cells via impeding VEGF signaling pathways.	There is ample evidence to suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogen factor in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and that blockade of VEGF-mediated signals can also prevent tumor growth via enforcing cell apoptosis. In the current study, we assessed the suppressing effect of VGB4, a VEGF antagonist peptide with the binding ability to both VEGF receptor1 and VEGF receptor2, on VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 using MTT assay, colony formation assay, and Scratch-wound assay. To evaluate the apoptotic inductive effect of VGB4 on A549 and HT29 cells, apoptosis analysis was carried out by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Likewise, p53 and PTEN expression level was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, the level of proteins involved in VEGF signaling pathways related to apoptosis was investigated using western blot analysis. Our results indicated that VGB4 markedly inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis of A549 and HT29 cells dose dependently. Encouragingly, significant downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, Procaspase9, and procaspase3, as well as upregulation of PTEN and P53 tumor suppressors, BCL2 associated X, Cytochrome c, cleaved caspase9, and cleaved caspase3 in VGB4-treated A549 and HT29 cells, further confirmed the profound inductive influence of VGB4 on apoptotic pathways. These findings along with the results from our previous studies show that VGB4 may be considerable for cancer therapy.	2022	06	09	Mol Biol Rep	Farzaneh Behelgardi	Maryam
35151528	10.1016/j.blre.2022.100930	CLL update 2022: A continuing evolution in care.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is diagnosed by the presence of a specific immunophenotype of clonal B cells in the peripheral blood. Prognostic models such as the CLL-International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) are now available that evaluate risk and assist in counseling individual patients. High risk CLL is characterized as the presence of del17p13, TP53 mutations and complex karyotype. Multiple phase 3 clinical trials show that continuous therapy with novel agents such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) and B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors either alone or in combination is the preferred approach compared to chemoimmunotherapy. Clinical trials testing novel combinations indicate that certain doublet and triplet therapies that are time limited, can achieve higher responses and undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD). Remaining problems with novel agent approaches are a combination of intolerance and disease progression with the latter occurring more often in high risk CLL. Clinical trials are now testing multiple combinations and sequences along with time limited administration of novel agents to develop refined approaches for both frontline and relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL cohorts. Further work is needed to accomplish several aspects including: how to deal with intolerance issues, identification of individuals who will relapse from novel combinations, definition of effective time limited approaches and when and if cellular therapies can be utilized to eliminate residual disease.	2022	05	26	Blood Rev	Kay	Neil E

The clinical and pathological data of the 45 patients with HGBL that had rearrangements of MYC and bcl-2 and/or bcl-6 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 1 138 LBL, 45 (4.0%) cases had combined rearrangements of MYC, bcl-2 and/or bcl-6 that included 6 HGBL cases with MYC, bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements, 14 HGBL cases with MYC and bcl-2 rearrangements, and 25 HGBL cases with MYC and bcl-6 rearrangements. Of these 45 patients, 29 patients were male, and 16 patients were female, aged 29 to 83 years. HGBL with MYC, bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements and HGBL with MYC and bcl-2 rearrangement were reclassified as the germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype using the Hans algorithm. HGBL with MYC and bcl-6 rearrangement were reclassified as the GCB subtype (68.0%) and the non-GCB subtype (32.0%). The vast majority of HGBL cases had a high Ki-67 proliferation index. Most HGBL patients had advanced stage disease with a high IPI score and an increased LDH level. Also, some patients had clinical features including elevated plasma β2-microglobulin levels, B symptoms, and bone marrow involvement. The IPI scores and LDH levels were significantly different between the HGBL cases with MYC, bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements and the HGBL cases with MYC and bcl-6 rearrangements (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Compared with the HGBL cases with MYC, bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements, the HGBL cases with MYC and bcl-2 or bcl-6 rearrangements had a lower incidence of bone marrow involvement (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in the prognosis among HGBL cases with MYC, bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements, the cases with MYC and bcl-2 rearrangements, and the cases with MYC and bcl-6 rearrangements (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> HGBL with MYC, bcl-2 and/or bcl-6 rearrangements are rare types of B-cell lymphoma with high degree of malignancy and have a short overall survival. To reduce misdiagnosis and improve diagnostic accuracy, it is necessary to assess the patients' clinical features and conduct histopathological, immunohistochemical and FISH analyses. <b>目的：</b> 探讨伴有MYC、bcl-2和/或bcl-6重排的高级别B细胞淋巴瘤（HGBL）的临床病理学特征。 <b>方法：</b> 收集2017年1月至2020年9月上海交通大学医学院附属瑞金医院病理科经MYC、bcl-2和bcl-6基因荧光原位杂交（FISH）检测的大B细胞淋巴瘤1 138例。对诊断为伴有MYC、bcl-2和/或bcl-6重排的HGBL回顾性分析其临床特点、病理学特征、免疫表型及预后。 <b>结果：</b> 在1 138例大B细胞淋巴瘤中，共检出45例（4.0%）伴有MYC、bcl-2和/或bcl-6重排的HGBL，其中6例HGBL伴有MYC、bcl-2和bcl-6重排，14例伴有MYC和bcl-2重排，25例伴有MYC和bcl-6重排。45例患者中男性29例，女性16例，发病年龄29~83岁。依据Hans分型，伴有MYC、bcl-2和bcl-6重排的HGBL、伴有MYC和bcl-2重排的HGBL均为生发中心B细胞（GCB）型，伴有MYC和bcl-6重排的HGBL包括GCB型（17/25，68.0%）和非GCB型（8/25，32.0%）。大部分病例显示Ki-67高增殖指数。临床表现Ann Arbor Ⅲ~Ⅳ期、国际预后指数（IPI）3~5分、血清乳酸脱氢酶（LDH）升高的患者均占半数以上，部分患者伴有血浆β2微球蛋白水平升高、B症状、骨髓侵犯等临床特征。伴有MYC、bcl-2和bcl-6重排的HGBL和伴有MYC和bcl-6重排的HGBL，这两组的IPI和LDH临床指标差异均有统计学意义（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。与伴有MYC、bcl-2和bcl-6重排的HGBL相比，伴有MYC和bcl-2或bcl-6重排的HGBL的骨髓侵犯发生率较低（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。此外，伴有MYC、bcl-2和/或bcl-6重排的HGBL任两组之间在预后方面差异无统计学意义（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）。 <b>结论：</b> 伴有MYC、bcl-2和/或bcl-6重排的HGBL是一种少见的B细胞淋巴瘤类型，其侵袭性强，预后较差。诊断时需要结合临床特征、病理组织学、免疫组织化学和荧光原位杂交检测结果，以减少漏诊和误诊。.	2022	02	15	Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi	Shen	X
35153031	10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.119097	Co-delivery of doxorubicin and siRNA by all-trans retinoic acid conjugated chitosan-based nanocarriers for multiple synergistic antitumor efficacy.	To achieve the co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting B-cell lymphoma 2 (siBcl-2), lactose acid (LA) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) double grafted N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) nanoparticles (GTA NPs) were developed. The relative viability of QGY-7703 cells was decreased to 81.3% when the concentration of GTA NPs was 0.1 mg/mL, but no toxicity to normal cells was observed, indicating that the GTA NPs selectively inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells. With DOX loaded into the hydrophobic core and siRNA condensed onto the hydrophilic shell, GTA/DOX/siRNA NPs were prepared. The GTA/DOX/siRNA NPs possessed high cellular uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Owing to multiple cooperative antitumor effects of DOX, siBcl-2, and GTA NPs, GTA/DOX/siRNA NPs had superior in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficiency to other formulations. These findings provide a guideline for the combined applications of multiple synergistic antitumor manners.	2022	02	22	Carbohydr Polym	Liu	Chang
35171311	10.1007/s00277-022-04785-z	CD37 expression in follicular lymphoma.	CD37 is a tetraspanin protein expressed in various B-cell lymphomas that mediates tumor survival signaling. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a representative B-cell neoplasm composed of germinal center B cells. In recent years, CD37 has been focused on as a therapeutic target for B-cell lymphoma. The purpose of this study was to characterize CD37 expression in FL patients to identify risk factors associated with various prognostic factors. We retrospectively reviewed 167 cases of FL and evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of CD37 and its statistical association with clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemically, CD37 was observed in the cytoplasm and/or membrane of neoplastic cells, mainly in neoplastic follicles to various extents. One hundred cases (100/167, 60.0%) were categorized as CD37-positive, and 67 cases were CD37-negative. In cases with high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), CD37-negative cases had a poor overall survival compared with CD37-positive cases (P = 0.047), although no significant differences were observed in other clinicopathologic factors, including histological grade, BCL2-IGH translocation, and immunohistochemical phenotype. Therefore, CD37 protein may play a role in tumor progression and may serve as a therapeutic target. However, further studies are needed to explore its significance.	2022	04	12	Ann Hematol	Yoshimura	Takuro
35176466	10.1016/j.jep.2022.115095	Cinobufagin induces FOXO1-regulated apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting G9a in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells.	Bufonis (VB), an animal drug called Chansu in China, is the product of the secretion of Bufo gargarizans Cantor or B. melanostictus Schneider. As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for a long time, it has been widely used in the treatment of heart failure, ulcer, pain, and various cancers. Cinobufaginn (CNB), the cardiotonic steroid or bufalene lactone extracted from VB, has the effects of detoxification, detumescence, and analgesia. The present study aimed to define the effects of CNB on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and identify the potential molecular mechanisms. A549 cells were treated with cinobufagin and cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were then evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays, respectively. Moreover, the levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cytokeratin8 (CK8), poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), Caspase3, Caspase8, B-cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2(Bcl-2), Bcl2-Associated X(Bax), forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), and euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase2 (G9a, EHMT2) in A549 cells were evaluated using qRT-PCR and/or Western blot analysis (WB), Co-IP, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. An in vivo imaging system, TUNEL, Immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were also used to detect proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA), Ki67, E-Cadherin(E-Cad), FOXO1, and G9a in mouse xenograft model experiments. CNB suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but promoted apoptosis in A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while cinobufagin had no cytotoxic effect on BEAS-2B cells. In vivo, cinobufagin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 cells and promoted their apoptosis. The occurrence of the above phenomena was accompanied by an increase in FOXO1 expression and a decrease in G9a expression. In A549 cells, CNB did not reverse the changes in the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of A549 cells after FOXO1 was successfully silenced. Our study provides the first evidence that cinobufagin suppresses the malignant biological behaviours of NSCLC cells in vivo and in vitro and suggests that mechanistically, this effect may be achieved by inhibiting the expression of the histone methyltransferase G9a and activating the tumour suppressor gene FOXO1. Taken together, our findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanism underlying cinobufagin's anticancer activity, and suggest that cinobufagin could be a candidate for targeted cancer therapy.	2022	04	04	J Ethnopharmacol	Zhang	Lingling
35178927	10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210902.701	[Molecular mechanism of Ganoderma against gastric cancer based on network pharmacology and experimental test].	This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of Ganoderma against gastric cancer based on network pharmacology, molecular docking, and cell experiment. The active components and targets of Ganoderma were retrieved from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform(TCMSP), and gastric cancer-related targets from GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man(OMIM). The protein-protein interaction(PPI) network of the common targets was constructed with STRING, followed by Gene Ontology(GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the common genes based on Bioconductor and R language. The medicinal-disease-component-target network and medicinal-disease-component-target-pathway network were established by Cytoscape. Molecular docking was performed between β-sitosterol(the key component in Ganoderma) and the top 15 targets in the PPI network. Cell experiment was performed to verify the findings. A total of 14 active components and 28 targets of Ganoderma were retrieved, and the medicinal and the disease shared 25 targets, including caspase-3(CASP3), caspase-8(CASP8), caspase-9(CASP9), and B-cell lymphoma-2(BCL2). The common targets involved 72 signaling pathways and apoptosis and p53 signaling pathway may play a crucial role in the effect of Ganoderma against gastric cancer. β-sitosterol had strong binding activity to the top 15 targets in the PPI network. The in vitro cell experiment demonstrated that β-sitosterol inhibited gastric cancer AGS cell proliferation by inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the S phase, which might be related to the regulation of the p53 pathway. This study shows the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway characteristics of Ganoderma against gastric cancer, which lays a scientific basis for further research on the molecular mechanism.	2022	02	21	Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi	Zhong	Jia-Yi

Retrospective case control study. Pathology Department of the University Hospital ""San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d'Aragona"" Salerno, Italy. Fourteen PCBCL, including Primary Cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma (PCFCL) and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Leg type (PCDLBCL-LT) and 14 nDLBCL were evaluated for 7-year period (January 2011 to December 2017). Primary cutaneous marginal zone cell lymphoma (PCMZL) cases were not included in the present study. Evaluation of immunohistochemical CD10, BCL6, MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, MYC and Ki-67 expression and classification according to three different algorithms. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on the same series using Lymph2Cx assay (Nanostring). The data obtained were compared and analysed. All the IHC algorithms showed 13 GCB and 15 non-GCB. GEP showed 12 GCB, 12 activated B cell-type and 4 unclassified. The PCBCL were classifiable as GCB and non-GCB like the nDLBCL as IHC algorithms were concordant to GEP and produced the same results.	2022	03	28	Pathol Res Pract	Cretella	Pasquale
35185150	10.1038/s41392-021-00870-3	Activation of RAS/MAPK pathway confers MCL-1 mediated acquired resistance to BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia.	Despite high initial response rates, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with the BCL-2-selective inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) alone or in combinations commonly acquires resistance. We performed gene/protein expression, metabolomic and methylation analyses of isogenic AML cell lines sensitive or resistant to VEN, and identified the activation of RAS/MAPK pathway, leading to increased stability and higher levels of MCL-1 protein, as a major acquired mechanism of VEN resistance. MCL-1 sustained survival and maintained mitochondrial respiration in VEN-RE cells, which had impaired electron transport chain (ETC) complex II activity, and MCL-1 silencing or pharmacologic inhibition restored VEN sensitivity. In support of the importance of RAS/MAPK activation, we found by single-cell DNA sequencing rapid clonal selection of RAS-mutated clones in AML patients treated with VEN-containing regimens. In summary, these findings establish RAS/MAPK/MCL-1 and mitochondrial fitness as key survival mechanisms of VEN-RE AML and provide the rationale for combinatorial strategies effectively targeting these pathways.	2022	04	04	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Zhang	Qi
35188042	10.1080/10428194.2022.2042689	Enhanced cytotoxicity of bisantrene when combined with venetoclax, panobinostat, decitabine and olaparib in acute myeloid leukemia cells.	Bisantrene (Bis), a topoisomerase-II inhibitor, is less cardiotoxic than the current anthracyclines. Its synergistic cytotoxicity with newly developed antineoplastic drugs has not been reported. We demonstrated the synergism of [Bis + ABT199/venetoclax] in combination with panobinostat (Pano), decitabine (DAC), or olaparib (Ola), known inhibitors of BCL2, histone deacetylase, DNA methyltransferase, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, respectively, in AML cells. [Bis + ABT199] with Pano, DAC, or Ola synergistically inhibited cell proliferation with combination indices of 0.25-0.6, 0.2-0.35, and 0.2-0.4 (at 50% inhibition of proliferation), respectively. Increased γ-H2AX suggests enhanced DNA damage; cleavages of Caspase 3 and PARP1, DNA fragmentation, increased ROS, and decreased MMP indicate potent apoptosis activation. Similar results were observed using mononuclear cells from leukemia patients but not from healthy donors. The SAPK/JNK signaling pathway was strongly activated by the combination treatments, whereas the PI3K/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin pro-survival pathways were inhibited. These drug combinations may be used in cytoreductive clinical trials for AML patients.	2022	07	12	Leuk Lymphoma	Valdez	Benigno C
35193595	10.1186/s12943-022-01516-w	BCL-2 expression promotes immunosuppression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by enhancing regulatory T cell differentiation and cytotoxic T cell exhaustion.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results in increased susceptibility to infections. T cell dysfunction is not associated with CLL in all patients; therefore, it is important to identify CLL patients with T cell defects. The role of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) in CLL has been explored; however, few studies have examined its role in T cells in CLL patients. Herein, we have investigated the regulatory role of BCL-2 in T cells in the CLL tumor microenvironment. The expression of BCL-2 in T cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. The regulatory roles of BCL-2 were investigated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and verified using multi-parameter flow cytometry on CD4 and CD8 T cells. The clinical features of BCL-2 expression in T cells in CLL were also explored. We found a significant increase in BCL-2 expression in the T cells of CLL patients (n = 266). Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) indicated that BCL-2<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had the gene signature of increased regulatory T cells (Treg); BCL-2<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed the gene signature of exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL); and increased expression of BCL-2 was associated with T cell activation and cellular adhesion. The results from scRNA-seq were verified in peripheral T cells from 70 patients with CLL, wherein BCL-2<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were enriched with Tregs and had higher expression of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β than BCL-2<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. BCL-2 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells was associated with exhausted cells (PD-1<sup>+</sup>Tim-3<sup>+</sup>) and weak expression of granzyme B and perforin. T cell-associated cytokine profiling revealed a negative association between BCL-2<sup>+</sup> T cells and T cell activation. Decreased frequencies and recovery functions of BCL-2<sup>+</sup>T cells were observed in CLL patients in complete remission after treatment with venetoclax. BCL-2 expression in the T cells of CLL patients is associated with immunosuppression via promotion of Treg abundance and CTL exhaustion.	2022	04	04	Mol Cancer	Liu	Lu
35198451	10.3389/fonc.2022.834288	Prognostic Value of Radiomic Features of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in Patients With B-Cell Lymphoma Treated With CD19/CD22 Dual-Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells.	In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of PET/CT-derived radiomic features for patients with B-cell lymphoma (BCL), who were treated with CD19/CD22 dual-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Moreover, we explored the relationship between baseline radiomic features and the occurrence probability of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). A total of 24 BCL patients who received <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT before CAR T-cell infusion were enrolled in the present study. Radiomic features from PET and CT images were extracted using LIFEx software, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select the most useful predictive features of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operating characteristic curves, Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier curves were conducted to assess the potential prognostic value. Contrast extracted from neighbourhood grey-level different matrix (NGLDM) was an independent predictor of PFS (HR = 15.16, p = 0.023). MYC and BCL2 double-expressor (DE) was of prognostic significance for PFS (HR = 7.02, p = 0.047) and OS (HR = 10.37, p = 0.041). The combination of NGLDM_Contrast<sub>PET</sub> and DE yielded three risk groups with zero (n = 7), one (n = 11), or two (n = 6) factors (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, for PFS and OS), respectively. The PFS was 85.7%, 63.6%, and 0%, respectively, and the OS was 100%, 90.9%, and 16.7%, respectively. Moreover, there was no significant association between PET/CT variables and CRS. In conclusion, radiomic features extracted from baseline <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT images in combination with genomic factors could predict the survival outcomes of BCL patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy.	2022	05	02	Front Oncol	Zhou	Yeye
35199915	10.1002/tox.23497	Nimbolide retards T cell lymphoma progression by altering apoptosis, glucose metabolism, pH regulation, and ROS homeostasis.	Nimbolide is reported as one of the potential anticancer candidates of the neem tree (Azadirachta indica A. Juss). The cytotoxic action of nimbolide has been well reported against a wide number of malignancies, including breast, prostate, lung, liver, and cervix cancers. Interestingly, only a few in vivo studies conducted on B cell lymphoma, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and buccal pouch carcinoma have shown the in vivo antitumor efficacy of nimbolide. Therefore, it is highly needed to examine the in vivo antineoplastic activity of nimbolide on a wide variety of cancers to establish nimbolide as a promising anticancer drug. In the present study, we investigated the tumor retarding action of nimbolide in a murine model of T cell lymphoma. We noticed significantly augmented apoptosis in nimbolide- administered tumor-bearing mice, possibly due to down-regulated expression of Bcl2 and up-regulated expression of p53, cleaved caspase-3, Cyt c, and ROS. The nimbolide treatment-induced ROS production by suppressing the expression of antioxidant regulatory enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase and catalase. In addition, nimbolide administration impaired glycolysis and pH homeostasis with concomitant inhibition of crucial glycolysis and pH regulatory molecules such as GLUT3, LDHA, MCT1, and V-ATPase, CAIX and NHE1, respectively. Taken together, the present investigation provides novel insights into molecular mechanisms of nimbolide inhibited T cell lymphoma progression and directs the utility of nimbolide as a potential anticancer therapeutic drug for the treatment of T cell lymphoma.	2022	05	03	Environ Toxicol	Jaiswara	Pradip Kumar
35205731	10.3390/cancers14040983	Chemotherapy-Free Targeted Anti-BCR-ABL+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Therapy May Benefit the Heart.	Targeted therapies are currently considered the best cost-benefit anti-cancer treatment. In hematological malignancies, however, relapse rates and non-hematopoietic side effects including cardiotoxicity remain high. Here, we describe significant heart damage due to advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(9;22) encoding the bcr-abl oncogene (BCR-ABL+ ALL) in murine xenotransplantation models. Echocardiography reveals severe cardiac dysfunction with impaired left ventricular function and reduced heart and cardiomyocyte dimensions associated with increased apoptosis. This cardiac damage is fully reversible, but cardiac recovery depends on the therapy used to induce ALL remission. Chemotherapy-free combination therapy with dasatinib (DAS), venetoclax (VEN) (targeting the BCR-ABL oncoprotein and mitochondrial B-cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2), respectively), and dexamethasone (DEX) can fully revert cardiac defects, whereas the depletion of otherwise identical ALL in a genetic model using herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) cannot. Mechanistically, dexamethasone induces a pro-apoptotic BCL2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) expression and apoptosis in ALL cells but enhances pro-survival B-cell lymphoma extra-large (BCLXL) expression in cardiomyocytes and clinical recovery with the reversion of cardiac atrophy. These data demonstrate that therapies designed to optimize apoptosis induction in ALL may circumvent cardiac on-target side effects and may even activate cardiac recovery. In the future, combining the careful clinical monitoring of cardiotoxicity in leukemic patients with the further characterization of organ-specific side effects and signaling pathways activated by malignancy and/or anti-tumor therapies seems reasonable.	2022	03	01	Cancers (Basel)	Kirchhoff	Hanna
35217188	10.1016/j.biocel.2022.106184	Galactocerebrosidase deficiency induces an increase in lactosylceramide content: A new hallmark of Krabbe disease?	Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) hydrolyses galactose residues from various substrates, including galactosylceramide, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), and lactosylceramide. Its severe deficiency has been associated with the accumulation of psychosine, a toxic molecule with detergent-like features, which alters membrane structures and signalling pathways, inducing the death of oligodendrocytes and a sequence of events in the nervous system that explain the appearance of many clinical signs typical of Krabbe disease. Nevertheless, new evidence suggests the existence of other possible links among GALC action, myelination, and myelin stability, apart from psychosine release. In this study, we demonstrated that lactosylceramide metabolism is impaired in fibroblasts isolated from patients with Krabbe disease in the absence of psychosine accumulation. This event is responsible for the aberrant and constitutive activation of the AKT/prolin-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) signalling axis, inducing B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) overexpression and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) inhibition. In addition, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) showed increased nuclear translocation. Due to the relevance of these molecular alterations in neurodegeneration, lactosylceramide increase should be evaluated as a novel marker of Krabbe disease, and because of its significant connections with signalling pathways.	2022	05	04	Int J Biochem Cell Biol	Papini	Nadia
35220171	10.1016/j.prp.2022.153812	Prognostic value of Bcl2 and Bcl6 in primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	To assess the prognostic value of Bcl2 and Bcl6 in primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (pcDLBCL), through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic databases were searched from their inception to April 2021 for studies reporting Bcl2 and Bcl6 expression and survival outcomes in pcDLBCL series. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analyses with hazard ratio calculation were performed for overall survival (OS), with a significant p-value&lt; 0.05. Eight studies with 148 patients were included. OS was significantly decreased in Bcl2-pos itive pcDLBCLs (5-year OS= 52.9 ± 5.2%) compared to Bcl2 negative pcDLBCLs (5-year OS= 86.6 ± 7.2%), with a HR of 4.615 (95% CI, 1.827-11.657; p = 0.001); no significant difference in OS was found between Bcl6-positive pcDLBCLs (5-year OS= 61.3 ± 6.5%) and Bcl6-negative pcDLBCLs (5-year OS= 56.8 ± 7.2%), with a HR of 0.789 (95% CI, 0.462-1.350; p = 0.388). In pcDLBCL, Bcl2 expression is a strong unfavourable prognostic marker; Bcl6 does not seem to be associated with survival instead. Further studies are necessary in this field.	2022	04	05	Pathol Res Pract	Russo	Daniela
35222803	10.1155/2022/6933812	Protection of Human Lens Epithelial Cells from Oxidative Stress Damage and Cell Apoptosis by KGF-2 through the Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway.	Oxidative stress exerts a significant influence on the pathogenesis of various cataracts by inducing degradation and aggregation of lens proteins and apoptosis of lens epithelial cells. Keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) exerts a favorable cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. In this work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of KGF-2 against hydrogen peroxide- (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-) induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) and rat lenses. KGF-2 pretreatment could reduce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. KGF-2 also increases B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD2), and catalase (CAT) levels while decreasing the expression level of Bcl2-associated X (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated HLECs. LY294002, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitor, abolished KGF-2's effect to some extent, demonstrating that KGF-2 protected HLECs via the PI3K/Akt pathway. On the other hand, KGF-2 activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway by regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Silencing nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by targeted-siRNA and inhibiting heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) significantly decreased cytoprotection of KGF-2. Furthermore, as revealed by lens organ culture assays, KGF-2 treatment decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced lens opacity in a concentration-dependent manner. As demonstrated by these data, KGF-2 resisted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress in HLECs through Nrf2/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt pathways, suggesting a potential protective effect against the formation of cataracts.	2022	03	17	Oxid Med Cell Longev	Liu	Shuyu
35223094	10.1155/2022/7687154	miR-197 Participates in Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Cardiomyocyte Injury by Modulating SIRT1.	Sepsis is a systemic inflammation and is capable of inducing myocarditis, which is a major leading cause of death in patients. Studies have found that miR-197 is correlated with the prognosis of patients with inflammatory heart disease, but its effect on sepsis-induced cardiomyocyte injury remains unclear. We treated H9c2 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), then detected the cell viability via the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and quantified miR-197 expression via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, we investigated the role of miR-197 in LPS-induced H9c2 cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurement, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), qRT-PCR, and western blot. Subsequently, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) was downregulated in H9c2 cells to explore its interaction with miR-197 under LPS induction. LPS induced miR-197 overexpression in H9c2 cells. LPS restrained viability, the expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and SIRT1, but promoted apoptosis, LDH release, and levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1<i>β</i> (IL-1<i>β</i>), acetyl (AC)-p53, BCL2-associated X (Bax), and cleaved caspase-3 in H9c2 cells. miR-197 inhibition reversed the effects of LPS on H9c2 cells. The protective role of miR-197 downregulation in LPS-induced H9c2 cells was reversed by SIRT1 silencing. miR-197 contributed to LPS-induced cardiomyocyte injury by modulating SIRT1, which might be used as a molecular marker in the management of sepsis.	2022	03	01	Cardiol Res Pract	Liu	Miaomiao

Forty cases of primary CNS DLBCL were subjected to targeted exome sequencing covering 413 genes, including <i>MYD88</i>, <i>CD79B</i> and <i>PIM1</i>. Mutational analysis recognized two groups. The CDP (including <i>CD79B</i> and/or <i>PIM1</i>mutations) group was identified in 27 cases (67.5%), and the non-CDP (without <i>CD79B</i> and PIM1 mutations) group was identified in 13 cases 32.5%). The CDP group tended to occur in older patients (median age 57.0 vs. 48.4 years, <i>p</i>=0.015). Patients in the CDP group had a significantly longer 2-year overall survival (OS) (76% and 40%, <i>p</i>=0.0372) than those in the non-CDP group. Multivariate analysis revealed that age less than 60 years, no MYC and BCL2 double expression, and CDP group were three independent risk factors indicating favorable OS. PyClone analysis revealed the subcloning heterogeneity between the groups. In addition, transcriptional sequencing was successfully performed in 8 cases. A total of 131 genes were significantly differentially expressed between these two groups. The major categories of biological processes that were significantly altered between these two groups related to intracellular metabolism mechanisms. We developed a new molecular classification to divide CNS DLBCL into CDP and non-CDP groups based on <i>CD79B</i> and <i>PIM1</i> mutational status. Patients with <i>PIM1</i> and/or <i>CD79B</i> mutations had favorable long-term survival after high-dose methotrexate-based polychemotherapy.	2022	03	01	Front Oncol	Zhou	Jihao
35225270	10.3791/62961	Enhancing Tumor Content through Tumor Macrodissection.	The presence of contaminating non-tumor tissues in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues can greatly undermine genomic studies. Herein we describe macrodissection, a method designed to augment the percentage tumor content of a tissue specimen by removing and eliminating unwanted tissue prior to performing downstream nucleic acid extractions. FFPE tissue blocks were sectioned to produce 4-5 µm slide-mounted tissue sections. A representative section was submitted for hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and subsequently reviewed by a board-certified pathologist. During the review, the pathologist identified and marked the regions of tumor tissue in the H&amp;E. Once complete, the demarked H&amp;E was used to guide resection of the serial unstained sections from the same tissue block. To demonstrate the effects of macrodissection, RNA extracted from matched macrodissected and non-dissected Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) were run on a digital gene expression assay capable of determining DLBCL subtype and BCL2 translocation status. The results showed that macrodissection changed the subtype or BCL2 translocation status calls in 60% of the samples examined. In conclusion, macrodissection is a simple and effective method for performing tumor enrichment prior to nucleic acid extractions, the product of which can then be confidently used in downstream genomic studies.	2022	04	07	J Vis Exp	Wisner	Lee
35231992	10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2022.01.009	[MYC and BCL-2 protein co-expression and prognosis of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a propensity score matching analysis].	<b>Objective:</b> We investigated the impact of MYC/BCL-2 protein co-expression on the prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and observed whether double expression (DE) remains an independent poor prognostic factor in DLBCL after the addition of therapeutic factors such as DA-EPOCH-R, central prophylaxis, and transplantation. <b>Methods:</b> Available pathological findings were retrospectively collected from 223 DLBCL patients at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2015 to 2018. Seventy-five patients with high MYC/BCL-2 expression were categorized as the DE group. From the 148 non-DE patients, 75 DLBCL patients were selected as the control group, using a 1∶1 matching on propensity scores for age, international prognostic index score, treatment choice, and etc. The differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups were compared. <b>Results:</b> The 3-year OS was (69.8±5.5) % for the DE group and (77.0±4.9) % for the non-DE group (<i>P</i>=0.225) , while the 3-year PFS was (60.7±5.8) % and (65.3±5.5) % , respectively (<i>P</i>=0.390) . Subgroup analysis in patients treated with the R-CHOP regimen revealed that for the DE and non-DE patients, the 3-year OS was (61.3±7.5) % and (77.2±5.6) % (<i>P</i>=0.027) , and the 3-year PFS was (52.1±7.5) % and (70.6±6.0) % (<i>P</i>=0.040) , respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age, stage of Ann Arbor, COO staging, whether central prophylaxis was performed, and whether transplantation was performed were significant independent risk factors of the prognosis of DLBCL patients (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) . On the other hand, MYC/BCL-2 protein double expression was not significantly associated with prognostic outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> MYC/BCL-2 protein double expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis under R-CHOP regimen treatment, but the poor prognostic impact of DE on DLBCL was eliminated under intensive regimens such as DA-EPOCH-R and transplantation. <b>目的：</b> 探究MYC/BCL-2蛋白双表达对弥漫大B细胞淋巴瘤（DLBCL）患者预后的影响，观察纳入DA-EPOCH-R（利妥昔单抗+依托泊苷+泼尼松+长春新碱+环磷酰胺+表阿霉素）、中枢神经系统预防治疗、移植等治疗因素后，双表达是否仍是DLBCL的独立预后不良因素。 <b>方法：</b> 回顾性收集2015-2018年在北京协和医院血液科治疗且具有可用病理结果的223例初治DLBCL患者，75例MYC/BCL-2高表达的患者归为双表达组，从148例非双表达的患者中，应用倾向性评分（PSM），根据年龄、国际预后指数（IPI）评分、治疗选择等因素进行1∶1匹配，筛选出75例作为对照组，比较两组患者总生存（OS）及无进展生存（PFS）等方面的差异。 <b>结果：</b> PSM后双表达组和非双表达组的3年OS率分别为（69.8±5.5）%及（77.0±4.9）%（<i>P</i>＝0.225），3年PFS率分别为（60.7±5.8）%及（65.3±5.5）%（<i>P</i>＝0.390），差异均无统计学意义。R-CHOP方案（利妥昔单抗+环磷酰胺+阿霉素+长春新碱+泼尼松）治疗的亚组分析显示，双表达和非双表达患者的3年OS率分别为（61.3±7.5）%及（77.2±5.6）%（<i>P</i>＝0.027），3年PFS率分别为（52.1±7.5）%及（70.6 ± 6.0）%（<i>P</i>＝0.040），差异均具有统计学意义。多因素Cox回归分析显示年龄、Ann Arbor分期、细胞起源（COO）分型、是否进行中枢神经系统预防、是否进行移植是DLBCL患者预后的独立影响因素（<i>P</i>值均&lt;0.05），而MYC/BCL-2蛋白双表达不是预后的影响因素。 <b>结论：</b> MYC/BCL-2蛋白双表达在R-CHOP方案治疗下与不良预后显著相关，但在DA-EPOCH-R、移植等治疗方案下，双表达对DLBCL的不良预后影响在一定程度上得到消除。.	2022	03	03	Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Zhan	J
35233562	10.15212/amm-2021-0002	The regulation of neuronal autophagy and cell survival by MCL1 in Alzheimer's disease.	Maintaining neuronal integrity and functions requires precise mechanisms controlling organelle and protein quality. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by functional defects in the clearance and recycling of intracellular components. As such, neuronal homeostasis involves autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis. Compromised activity in these cellular processes may cause pathological phenotypes of AD. Dysfunction of mitochondria is one of the hallmarks of AD. Mitophagy is a critical mitochondria quality control system, and the impaired mitophagy is observed in AD. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), a member of the pro-survival B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) family, is a mitochondria-targeted protein that contributes to maintaining mitochondrial integrity. <i>Mcl1</i> knockout mice display peri-implantation lethality. The studies on conditional <i>Mcl1</i> knockout mice demonstrate that MCL1 plays a central role in neurogenesis and neuronal survival during brain development. Accumulating evidence reveals the critical role of MCL1 as a regulator of neuronal autophagy, mitophagy, and survival. In this review, we discuss the emerging neuroprotective function of MCL1 and how dysregulation of MCL1 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. As the pro-survival BCL2 family of proteins are promising targets of pharmacological intervention with BH3 mimetic drugs, we also discuss the promise of MCL1-targeting therapy in AD.	2022	03	04	Acta Mater Med	Rezaeian	Abdol-Hossein
35234557	10.1080/1354750X.2022.2048892	Phytochemical constituents and protective efficacy of <i>Schefflera arboricola</i> L. leaves extract against thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy in rats.	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from liver failure. To evaluate the protective effect of <i>Schefflera arboricola</i> L. leaves methanol extract against thioacetamide (TAA) induced HE in rats. GC/MS, LC-ESI-MS, and the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined. The methanol extract was orally administrated (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 21 days. TAA (200 mg/kg body weight) was given intraperitoneally on day 19 and continued for three days. The evaluation was done by measuring alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ammonia, reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interlukin-6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and the cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163). The histological features of the liver and brain were conducted. Forty-five compounds were identified from the n-hexane fraction, while twenty-nine phenolic compounds were determined from the methanol extract. Pre-treatment with the plant extract returned most of the measurements under investigation to nearly normal. Due to its richness with bioactive compounds, <i>Schefflera arboricola</i> L. leaves methanolic extract succeeded to exert anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidants properties in TAA-induced HE in rats with more efficacy to its high protective dose.	2022	06	02	Biomarkers	El-Hagrassi	Ali M
35236331	10.1186/s12885-022-09237-5	Prognostic mutational subtyping in de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease defined using a number of well-established molecular subsets. Application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to whole exome sequence data has previously been used to identify six distinct molecular clusters in DLBCL with potential clinical relevance. In this study, we applied NMF-clustering to targeted sequencing data utilizing the FoundationOne Heme® panel from the Phase III GOYA (NCT01287741) and Phase Ib/II CAVALLI studies (NCT02055820) in de novo DLBCL. Biopsy samples, survival outcomes, RNA-Seq and targeted exome-sequencing data were available for 423 patients in GOYA (obinutuzumab [G]-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP] vs rituximab [R]-CHOP) and 86 patients in CAVALLI (venetoclax+[G/R]-CHOP). When the NMF algorithm was applied to samples from the GOYA study analyzed using a comprehensive genomic profiling platform, four of the six groups previously reported were observed: MYD88/CD79B, BCL2/EZH2, NOTCH2/TNFAIP3, and no mutations. Mutation profiles, cell-of-origin subset distributions and clinical associations of MYD88/CD79B and BCL2/EZH2 groups were similar to those described in previous NMF studies. In contrast, application of NMF to the CAVALLI study yielded only three; MYD88/CD79B-, BCL2/EZH2-like clusters, and a no mutations group, and there was a trend towards improved outcomes for BCL2/EZH2 over MYD88/CD79B. This analysis supports the utility of NMF used in conjunction with targeted sequencing platforms for identifying patients with different prognostic subsets. The observed trend for improved overall survival in the BCL2/EZH2 group is consistent with the mechanism of action of venetoclax, suggesting that targeting sequencing and NMF has potential for identifying patients who are more likely to gain benefit from venetoclax therapy.	2022	03	17	BMC Cancer	Kim	Eugene
35237395	10.1177/20406207221080738	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare B-cell malignancy that remains challenging to treat with high rates of relapse. Frontline strategies range from intensive chemotherapy followed by consolidation with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), to less-intensive therapies including combination regimens. The treatment landscape for relapsed patients includes Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors among other targeted treatments. Novel agents such as the selective BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax showed high response rates when used as monotherapy for refractory relapsed MCL. The rituximab, bendamustine, and cytarabine (R-BAC) regimen, while response rates were high, were not durable. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products targeting CD19 have been efficacious in relapsed and refractory MCL patients. Brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel, formerly KTE-X19) was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July, 2020, for treatment of refractory and relapsed MCL. This article provides an overview for the available management strategies for relapsed MCL and examines the role of CAR T-cell in the current and future treatment of MCL.	2022	03	04	Ther Adv Hematol	Tbakhi	Bushra

B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) is a key protein regulator of apoptosis. The hydrophobic groove in Bcl2 is a unique structural feature to this class of enzymes and found to have a profound impact on protein overall structure, function, and dynamics. Dynamics of the hydrophobic groove is an essential determinant of the catalytic activity of Bcl2, an implicated protein in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). The mobility of α3-α4 helices around the catalytic site of the protein remains crucial to its activity. The preferential binding mechanisms of the multi-catalytic sites of the Bcl2 enzyme have been a subject of debate in the literature. In addition to our previous report on the same protein, herein, we further investigate the preferential binding modes and the conformational implications of Venetoclax-JQ1 dual drug binding at both catalytic active sites of Bcl2. Structural analysis revealed asymmetric α3-α4 helices movement with the expansion of the distance between the α3 and α4 helix in Venetoclax-JQ1 dual inhibition by 15.2% and 26.3%, respectively when compared to JQ1 and Venetoclax individual drug inhibition-resulting in remarkable widening of hydrophobic groove. Moreso, a reciprocal enhanced binding effect was observed: Venetoclax increased the binding affinity of JQ1 by 11.5%, while the JQ1 fostered the binding affinity of Venetoclax by 16.3% compared with individual inhibition of each drug. This divergence has also resulted in higher protein stability, and prominent correlated motions were observed with the least fluctuations and multiple van der Waals interactions. Findings offer vital conformational dynamics and structural mechanisms of enzyme-single ligand and enzyme-dual ligand interactions, which could potentially shift the current therapeutic protocol of Waldenström macroglobulinemia.	2022	05	24	Protein J	Elamin	Ghazi
35240234	10.1016/j.canlet.2022.215608	DT7 peptide-modified lecithin nanoparticles co-loaded with γ-secretase inhibitor and dexamethasone efficiently inhibit T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and reduce gastrointestinal toxicity.	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a serious hematologic malignancy and glucocorticoid resistance is the main recurrent cause for a high relapsed and death rate. Here, we proposed an effective therapeutic regimen of combining gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) with dexamethasone (DEX) to overcome glucocorticoid resistance. Moreover, the bone marrow targeting DT7 peptide-modified lecithin nanoparticles co-loaded with DEX and GSI (TLnp/D&amp;G) were developed to enhance T-ALL cells recognition and endocytosis. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that TLnp/D&amp;G significantly inhibited cell survival and promoted apoptosis of T-ALL cells. Mechanically, we found that GSIs promoted DEX-induced cell apoptosis by two main synergetic mechanisms: 1) GSIs significantly upregulated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in T-ALL and restored the glucocorticoid-induced pro-apoptotic response. 2) Both DEX and GSI synergistically inhibited BCL2 and suppressed the survival of T-ALL cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that TLnp/D&amp;G showed high bone marrow accumulation and better antileukemic efficacy both in leukemia bearing models and in systemic Notch1-induced T-ALL models, with excellent biosafety and reduced gastrointestinal toxicity. Overall, our study provides new strategies for the treatment of T-ALL and promising bone marrow targeting systems with high transformation potential.	2022	04	22	Cancer Lett	Zhou	Ying
35241367	10.1016/j.semcdb.2022.01.011	Mitochondrial-apoptotic signaling involvement in remodeling during myogenesis and skeletal muscle atrophy.	Mitochondria play a major role in apoptotic signaling. In addition to its role in eliminating dysfunctional cells, mitochondrial apoptotic signaling is implicated as a key component of myogenic differentiation and skeletal muscle atrophy. For example, the activation of cysteine-aspartic proteases (caspases; CASP's) can aid in the initial remodeling stages of myogenic differentiation by cleaving protein kinases, transcription factors, and cytoskeletal proteins. Precise regulation of these signals is needed to prevent excessive cell disassemble and subsequent cell death. During skeletal muscle atrophy, the activation of CASP's and mitochondrial derived nucleases participate in myonuclear fragmentation, a potential loss of myonuclei, and cleavage of contractile structures within skeletal muscle. The B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins play a significant role in regulating myogenesis and skeletal muscle atrophy by governing the initiating steps of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. This review discusses the role of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle remodeling during myogenic differentiation and skeletal muscle pathological states, including aging, disuse, and muscular dystrophy.	2022	03	04	Semin Cell Dev Biol	Ahmad Rahman	Fasih
35255774	10.1080/15548627.2022.2048432	TET2 regulates osteoclastogenesis by modulating autophagy in OVX-induced bone loss.	Increased bone resorption by osteoclasts after estrogen deficiency is the main cause of postmenopausal osteoporosis. TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) is a DNA demethylase that regulates cellular function and differentiation potential. Macroautophagy/autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by recycling unnecessary and damaged organelles. This study revealed that TET2 promoted bone loss in oophorectomized (OVX) mice and that TET2 promoted osteoclast differentiation by regulating autophagy. <i>Tet2</i> knockdown inhibited autophagy and osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Mechanistically, <i>Tet2</i> knockdown increased BCL2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) expression and BCL2 exhibited increased binding to BECN1 and negatively regulated autophagy. Small interfering RNA specific to <i>Bcl2</i> interfered with BCL2 expression in <i>Tet2</i>-knockdown bone marrow cells/precursors, partially reversing autophagy dysregulation and promoting osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, the LV-sh<i>Tet2</i> lentivirus prevented bone loss in OVX mice. In summary, our findings provide evidence that TET2 promotes osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting BCL2 expression and positively regulating BECN1-dependent autophagy.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ACP5/TRAP: acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant; ATP6V0D2: ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal V0 subunit D2; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; BMs: bone marrow cells; CTSK: cathepsin K; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MMP9: matrix metallopeptidase 9; OVX: oophorectomy; RUNX1: runt related transcription factor 1; SOCS3: suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; SPI1/PU.1: Spi-1 proto-oncogene; TNFSF11/RANKL: tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11; TET2: tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2.	2022	03	24	Autophagy	Yang	Chen
35256453	10.1523/ENEURO.0434-21.2022	Agmatine Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity by Activating PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.	Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity can be partially attributed to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and agmatine is well-known for the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway to inhibit ROS production. Whether agmatine could be used to alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is investigated. Cisplatin-exposed House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells and cochlear explants showed increased ROS production detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and decreased cell viability detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) or Myosin 7a staining, which could be reversed by the agmatine pretreatment. Cisplatin intraperitoneally injected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated damaged auditory function as indicated by distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) assays, and trans-tympanically administrated agmatine in the left ears could partly prevent the auditory function loss. Mechanistically, downregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, upregulated Bcl2-associated x (Bax) expression, and diminished p-PI3K and p-AKT expression were detected in cisplatin-exposed HEI-OC1 cells and cochlear explants, which could be prevented by the pretreatment with agmatine. Our investigation demonstrates that agmatine pretreatment could alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity with the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.	2022	04	01	eNeuro	Zhang	Ying
35266562	10.1002/ajh.26523	Mantle cell lymphoma in 2022-A comprehensive update on molecular pathogenesis, risk stratification, clinical approach, and current and novel treatments.	The field of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has witnessed remarkable progress due to relentless advances in molecular pathogenesis, prognostication, and newer treatments. MCL consists of a spectrum of clinical subtypes. Rarely, atypical cyclin D1-negative MCL and in situ MCL neoplasia are identified. Prognostication of MCL is further refined by identifying somatic mutations (such as TP53, NSD2, KMT2D), methylation status, chromatin organization pattern, SOX-11 expression, minimal residual disease (MRD), and genomic clusters. Lymphoid tissue microenvironment studies demonstrated the role of B-cell receptor signaling, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, the CD70-SOX-11 axis. Molecular mechanism of resistance, mutation dynamics, and pathogenic pathways (B-cell receptor (BCR), oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC) were identified in mediating resistance to various treatments (bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors [ibrutinib, acalabrutinib]. Treatment options range from conventional chemoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT) to targeted therapies against BTK (covalent and noncovalent), Bcl2, ROR1, cellular therapy such as anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T), and most recently bispecific antibodies against CD19 and CD20. MCL patients frequently relapse. Complex pathogenesis and the management of patients with progression after treatment with BTK/Bcl2 inhibitors and CAR-T (triple-resistant MCL) remain a challenge. Next-generation clinical trials incorporating newer agents and concurrent translational and molecular investigations are ongoing.	2022	04	07	Am J Hematol	Jain	Preetesh
35276693	10.1097/CAD.0000000000001282	LncRNA ZFPM2-AS1 drives the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma via modulating the downstream miR-3612/DTL signaling.	LncRNA ZFPM2-AS1 has been illuminated to function as a carcinogenic driver in various human cancers. Whereas, the role of ZFPM2-AS1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains puzzled. To further understand NPC pathogenesis, we investigated the regulatory effects of ZFPM2-AS1 in NPC. Expression analysis for ZFPM2-AS1, miR-3612 and denticleless E3 ubiquitin protein ligase homolog (DTL) mRNA was carried out using real-time quantitative PCR. For the expression analysis of DTL protein, a western blot assay was applied. Cell proliferation was ascertained using the cell counting kit-8 assay and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis was estimated based on the expression levels of BCL2-Associated X and B-cell lymphoma-2 using western blot assay. To verify the role of ZFPM2-AS1, a Xenograft model was prepared in vivo. The underlying binding between miR-3612 and ZFPM2-AS1 or DTL was validated through dual-luciferase-reporter assay or protein immunoprecipitation assay. ZFPM2-AS1 showed upregulated expression in NPC samples and cells. Meanwhile, ZFPM2-AS1 was mainly located in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of ZFPM2-AS1 restrained NPC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, as well as suppressed tumorigenesis in animal models. ZFPM2-AS1 targeted miR-3612 whose expression was decreased in NPC samples and cells. Repression of miR-3612 aggravated NPC cell development and largely reversed the functional role of ZFPM2-AS1 silencing on NPC cell growth. MiR-3612 directly interacted with DTL, and DTL expression was upregulated in NPC. Downregulation of DTL blocked NPC cell growth, while miR-3612 inhibition partly abrogated the effects of DTL knockdown. ZFPM2-AS1 knockdown considerably restrained NPC development via targeting the miR-3612/DTL signaling. The study provided new insights to understand NPC pathogenesis.	2022	05	19	Anticancer Drugs	Chang	Xiaojing

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is among the main complications of diabetes mellitus and has been a major factor of renal failure. This study was designed to address the association between beta-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17, and IL-33 and the development of DN. In this study, 20 healthy volunteers and 100 patients were enrolled. According to their biochemical markers, the patients were categorized into five groups: diabetic, chronic renal disease, diabetic chronic renal disease, end-stage renal disease, and diabetic end-stage renal disease. Our results showed a noticeable elevation in IL-1β and IL-17 levels and a reduction in IL-33 and Bcl-2 levels in all investigated groups compared with those in the healthy group. Positive correlations were found between IL-1β and fasting blood sugar and between creatinine levels and IL-17, HbA1c%, and sodium levels. However, negative correlations were found between IL-33 and urea and sodium concentrations and between Bcl-2 and HbA1c% and creatinine levels. The present data revealed a marked relationship between Bcl-2, IL-1β, IL-17, and IL-33 levels and the onset and progression of DN. Understanding the molecular pathways of these processes could be translated into the development of therapeutic strategies.	2022	06	09	Mol Biol Rep	Mahmoud	Basant
35279534	10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.02.028	Ascorbic acid regulates mouse spermatogonial stem cell proliferation in a Wnt/β-catenin/ROS signaling dependent manner.	Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provide a foundation for spermatogenesis, but the mechanism of SSC proliferation is still poorly understood. To investigate whether and how ascorbic acid (AA) regulates the growth of mouse SSCs in vitro, the SSCs were cultured in different concentration AA medium for 14 days. The proliferation, apoptosis and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of SSCs in different AA groups were respectively detected. Moreover, the SSC activity in 40 μg/mL AA group and the control was tested by a transplantation assay. To explore the mechanism of AA regulating mouse SSCs proliferation, the dishevelled homolog 2 (DVL2) and nucleoredoxin (NRX) protein levels, the expression of axis inhibition protein 2 (Axin2), leucine-rich G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-Associated X (Bax), c-myc and cyclin D1 genes in Wnt/β-catenin pathway were respectively confirmed. The results showed that the adding concentration of AA did not affect the main shape of SSCs. A 40 μg/mL AA in culture medium promoted the proliferation, and decreased the ROS production and apoptosis rate of SSCs. Moreover, colonization efficiency in the seminiferous tubules of the recipient testis in 40 μg/mL AA group was higher compared with the control group by a transplantation assay. Finally, the appropriate ROS in the 40 μg/mL AA group further adjust the levels of DVL2 and NRX protein in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to maintain the nuclear intensity of β-catenin, in turn, the expression of apoptosis gene Bax decreased, while the expression of Bcl2, Axin2, Lgr5, c-myc and cyclin D1 genes increased. The study confirmed that AA adjusts the endogenous ROS level to impact on SSC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner by Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.	2022	04	14	Theriogenology	Xue	Xiuheng

Therefore, we investigated the effect of metformin on uterus of DG-induced aging mice model. Mice were randomly divided into three groups, that is, control (CN), DG-induced aging model and aging model treated with metformin. Histomorphometric results showed significantly decreased number of uterine glands, endometrial thickness, and increased luminal epithelium height in aging model. Furthermore, metformin resumed the number of uterine glands, endometrial thickness, and luminal epithelium height up to CN group. Metformin has also significantly decreased the age-associated oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and lipid hydroperoxide). Superoxide dismutase was significantly decreased in both treated groups compared to the CN group. However, catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes were significantly increased by metformin compared to the aging model. Immunostaining of active caspase3 and BAX were intense in the endometrium of aging model compare to CN- and metformin-treated groups. Localization of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) showed intense immunostaining in the uterus of CN- and metformin-treated groups, with mild immunostaining in aging model. Our observations suggested that metformin treatment might be helpful for management of age-associated uterine dysfunctions. Moreover, it may be concluded that metformin might ameliorate uterine dysfunctions by reducing oxidative stress, suppressing apoptosis, and increasing the survival/antiapoptotic protein Bcl2.	2022	06	14	J Exp Zool A Ecol Integr Physiol	Rempuia	Vanlal
35292420	10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2022.112426	Blue light induces skin apoptosis and degeneration through activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-autophagy apoptosis axis: Protective role of hydrogen sulfide.	Research on the phototoxicity of blue light (BL) to the skin is increasing. Although blue light can induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and inhibition of proliferation in skin cells, the mechanism by which blue light damages the skin is not yet clear. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy are two mechanisms by which cells resist external interference factors and maintain cell homeostasis and normal function, and both can affect cell apoptosis. Interestingly, we have found that blue light (435 nm ~ 445 nm, 8000 lx, 6-24 h)-induced oxidative stress triggers the ER stress-CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) signal and affects the protein levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl2-associated X (Bax), thereby promoting apoptosis. In addition, blue light activates autophagy in skin cells, which intensifies cell death. When ER stress is inhibited, autophagy is subsequently inhibited, suggesting that blue light-induced autophagy is influenced by ER stress. These evidences suggest that blue light induces activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-ER stress-autophagy-apoptosis axis signaling, which further induces skin injury and apoptosis. This is the first report on the relationships among oxidative stress, ER stress, autophagy, and apoptosis in blue light-induced skin injury. Furthermore, we have studied the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) on blue light-induced skin damage, and found that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S can protect skin from blue light-induced damage by regulating the ROS-ER stress-autophagy-apoptosis axis. Our data shows that when we are exposed to blue light, such as sunbathing and jaundice treatment, H<sub>2</sub>S may be developed as a protective agent.	2022	03	31	J Photochem Photobiol B	Zhu	Sen
35296646	10.1038/s41419-022-04684-1	Dual BTK/SYK inhibition with CG-806 (luxeptinib) disrupts B-cell receptor and Bcl-2 signaling networks in mantle cell lymphoma.	Aberrant B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a key driver in lymphoid malignancies. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors that disrupt BCR signaling have received regulatory approvals in therapy of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, responses are incomplete and patients who experience BTK inhibitor therapy failure have dire outcomes. CG-806 (luxeptinib) is a dual BTK/SYK inhibitor in clinical development in hematologic malignancies. Here we investigated the pre-clinical activity of CG-806 in MCL. In vitro treatment with CG-806 thwarted survival of MCL cell lines and patient-derived MCL cells in a dose-dependent manner. CG-806 blocked BTK and SYK activation and abrogated BCR signaling. Contrary to ibrutinib, CG-806 downmodulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, abrogated survival of ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines, and partially reversed the pro-survival effects of stromal microenvironment-mimicking conditions in primary MCL cells. Dual BTK/SYK inhibition led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization accompanied by mitophagy and metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis. In vivo studies of CG-806 demonstrated improved survival in one of the two tested aggressive MCL PDX models. While suppression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and NFκB signaling correlated with in vivo drug sensitivity, OxPhos and MYC transcriptional programs were upregulated in the resistant model following treatment with CG-806. BAX and NFKBIA were implicated in susceptibility to CG-806 in a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 library screen (in a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line). A high-throughput in vitro functional drug screen demonstrated synergy between CG-806 and Bcl-2 inhibitors. In sum, dual BTK/SYK inhibitor CG-806 disrupts BCR signaling and induces metabolic reprogramming and apoptosis in MCL. The Bcl-2 network is a key mediator of sensitivity to CG-806 and combined targeting of Bcl-2 demonstrates synergy with CG-806 warranting continued exploration in lymphoid malignancies.	2022	04	08	Cell Death Dis	Thieme	Elana
35297566	10.1111/pin.13223	Clinicopathological analysis of follicular lymphoma with BCL2, BCL6, and MYC rearrangements.	Most follicular lymphomas (FL) show t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 translocation, but rearrangement (R) negative cases exist. A series of 140 FL patients with a BCL2, BCL6, and MYC gene status examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were classified into five groups: (a) BCL2-R group (BCL2-R/BCL6-G/MYC-G) (G, germline), 77 cases; (b) BCL2/BCL6 double-R group (BCL2-R/BCL6-R/MYC-G), 16 cases; (c) BCL6-R group (BCL2-G/BCL6-R/MYC-G), 16 cases; (d) MYC-R group (BCL2-R or G/BCL6-R or G/MYC-R), three cases; (e) Triple-G group (BCL2-G/BCL6-G/MYC-G), 28 cases. The BCL6-R group had different clinicopathological characteristics. It showed lower rates of an advanced clinical stage and bone marrow invasion, less disease progression (p = 0.036), and a 'trend' toward a favorable progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.06). It also showed higher rates of grade 3A and MUM1-expression, and when analyzing the interfollicular spread pattern of CD20-positive cells, had fewer cases showing the IF3+ pattern (high interfollicular spread). Moreover, cases with BCL6-R and/or BCL6 gain (with cases of BCL2 rearrangement and/or of copy number gain excluded) correlated with favorable PFS (p = 0.014) and less IF3+ pattern (p = 0.007). We demonstrated that BCL6-R FLs showed unique clinicopathological findings, and FISH of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC is useful for FL diagnosis and clinical management.	2022	06	21	Pathol Int	Ikoma	Haruka
35299080	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2022.151913	HIV-associated DLBCL: Clinicopathological factors including dual-colour chromogenic in situ hybridisation to assess MYC gene copies.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprises up to 43% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in South Africa due to the high seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the southern African region. We explored the prognostic influence of an array of clinicopathological factors, including MYC gene copy numbers, within HIV-associated DLBCL. The retrospective inclusion of 123 tumours was followed by c-MYC immunohistochemistry and dual-colour MYC and centromere 8 (CEN8) chromogenic in situ hybridisation on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Clinicopathological data were collected, interpreted and analysed. HIV seropositive patients comprised 81% (93/115), mean age 42 (SD 10.8) years, with 55% males, HIV negative patients comprised 19% (22/115), mean age 57 (SD 16.7) years (p = 0.001), with 59% males and the HIV status was unknown for 8 patients. The median CD4 count was 162 (IQR 215) cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 33% of patients presented with CD4 counts &lt;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and the median viral load was 217 (IQR 182 981) copies/mL. There was advanced stage at presentation (i.e., III-IV, 87%), with Ki-67 proliferation indices ≥90% in 85%- and c-MYC expression (i.e., ≥40%) in 58% of tumours. Double expression of c-MYC and BCL2 was associated with a non-germinal center immunophenotype (p &lt; 0.01). Low-level increase of MYC gene copy numbers and MYC rearrangements occurred in 57% and 12%, respectively. C8 polysomy, MYC gene clusters and concurrent MYC rearrangement/increased MYC gene copies were also detected. Inferior median overall survival (OS) occurred when the CD4 counts were &lt;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (149 days 95% CI 44-254, p 0,04) and when IPI scores were 3-5 [155 days (95% CI 37-273), p = 0.01]. Concomitant infections negatively impacted the survival outcome, multivariate regression analysis (HR 4.01, 95% CI 1.86-12.20, p = 0.02). c-MYC protein expression, low-level increase in MYC gene copy numbers, rearrangement, C8 polysomy, MYC gene clusters and concurrent MYC rearrangement/low-level gains are present in HIV+ DLBCL. CD4 counts &lt; 100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, IPI scores 3-5 and concomitant infections negatively impact the survival outcome.	2022	05	23	Ann Diagn Pathol	Pather	Sugeshnee
35303910	10.1186/s13045-022-01249-9	Altered pathways and targeted therapy in double hit lymphoma.	High-grade B-cell lymphoma with translocations involving MYC and BCL2 or BCL6, usually referred to as double hit lymphoma (DHL), is an aggressive hematological malignance with distinct genetic features and poor clinical prognosis. Current standard chemoimmunotherapy fails to confer satisfying outcomes and few targeted therapeutics are available for the treatment against DHL. Recently, the delineating of the genetic landscape in tumors has provided insight into both biology and targeted therapies. Therefore, it is essential to understand the altered signaling pathways of DHL to develop treatment strategies with better clinical benefits. Herein, we summarized the genetic alterations in the two DHL subtypes (DHL-BCL2 and DHL-BCL6). We further elucidate their implications on cellular processes, including anti-apoptosis, epigenetic regulations, B-cell receptor signaling, and immune escape. Ongoing and potential therapeutic strategies and targeted drugs steered by these alterations were reviewed accordingly. Based on these findings, we also discuss the therapeutic vulnerabilities that coincide with these genetic changes. We believe that the understanding of the DHL studies will provide insight into this disease and capacitate the finding of more effective treatment strategies.	2022	04	13	J Hematol Oncol	Zhuang	Yuxin
35308723	10.7759/cureus.22023	Conjunctival Pediatric-Type Follicular Lymphoma in a Young Male: A Case Report and Literature Review.	Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma is a disease that affects the lymph nodes of the head and neck in the adult and pediatric patient groups. Ocular involvement is exceedingly rare, especially in the pediatrics age group; therefore, keeping a high clinical suspicion is warranted. Here, we report a rare conjunctival pediatric-type follicular lymphoma in a 15-year-old boy presenting with progressive swelling over the medial aspect of the left bulbar conjunctiva for two months. On examination, the mass was firm, mobile, well encapsulated, wide-based, and had a negative transillumination. An excisional biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry studies revealed lymphoid tissue that was positive for CD20, CD79a, BCL6, and CD10; and negative for BCL2 and MUM1. The CD21 and CD23 positivity highlighted the presence of an expanded follicular dendritic cell meshwork. The patient was diagnosed with conjunctival pediatric-type follicular lymphoma and referred to an oncology center for further examination and treatment. This lymphoma is rare, requiring high clinical suspicion, and thus, reporting the case detail is important and valuable for ophthalmologists and general pediatrics practitioners alike.	2022	03	22	Cureus	Alnaim	Abdullah F
35313087	10.1111/cbdd.14041	Ginsenoside Rg1 improves Alzheimer's disease by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation through Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that can cause cognitive impairment. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has a significant neuroprotective effect on animals with memory impairment. However, the mechanism of how Rg1 mediates the Wnt signaling pathway and improves cognitive function by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation is still unclear. In this study, the spatial memory ability of tree shrews was tested by Morris water maze, the expression levels of amyloid protein (Aβ1-42), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iba-1), nitrotyrosine (NT), and 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHG) were detected by immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, the activity of catalase (CAT) and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was, respectively, measured by the ammonium molybdate method and the 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid). Furthermore, the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was determined by the thiobarbituric acid test. Finally, the expression levels of Beta-secretase (BACE1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), BCL2-Associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-anti-apoptotic factor Cleaved-caspase-3 (Caspase-3), microtubule-associated proteins 2 (MAP2), Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), as well as the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and β-catenin were detected by Western blot. This study implied that Rg1 reduced the phosphorylation of Tau protein, the deposition of Aβ1-42, and the expression of BACE1. It also showed that Rg1 increased the antioxidant activity of SOD, CAT, GPx, and instead reduced the oxidation products of NT, 8-OHG, and MDA, as wells as the inflammatory factor interleukin-1 and iba-1. It further showed that Rg1 increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax and expression of neuronal markers MAP2 and NeuN, but instead reduced the expression of Caspase-3, GSK-3β, and β-catenin. In conclusion, by regulating the Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, Rg1 of moderate and high dose could alleviate oxidative stress damage, improve neuroinflammation, protect neurons, finally improve the cognitive impairment of the AD tree shrew. This study provides theoretical basis for the Rg1 clinical application in AD.	2022	05	17	Chem Biol Drug Des	Yang	Yi
35316462	10.1007/s11064-022-03544-w	Transcription Factor HEY1 Improves Brain Vascular Endothelial Cell Function and Alleviates Ischemic Stroke by Upregulating NOTCH3.	To investigate the function of hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1 (HEY1) and Notch receptor 3 (NOTCH3) in ischemic stroke. Stroke models were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in rats and rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), respectively. Neurological deficit evaluation and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining were used to assess cerebral injury. The expression of HEY1 and NOTCH3 was manipulated using gain and loss of function approaches. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and Western blotting analysis of cleaved caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) were used to evaluate apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-18. The proliferation and migration of BMVECs were analyzed by Ki-67 immunofluorescence and scratch assay, respectively. Tube formation assay was conducted to measure the length of capillary-like tubes formed by BMVECs. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to testify the relationship between HEY1 and NOTCH3. HEY1 and NOTCH3 were upregulated in MCAO and OGD models. HEY1 ameliorated ischemic injuries in MCAO rats. Knockdown of HEY1 or NOTCH3 promoted OGD-induced apoptosis and inflammation and inhibited proliferation and migration in BMVECs. NOTCH3 was a binding protein of HEY1. Overexpression of HEY1 offset the disease-promoting effect of NOTCH3 silencing. HEY1 suppresses apoptosis and inflammation and promotes proliferation and migration in BMVECs by upregulating NOTCH3, thereby ameliorating ischemic stroke.	2022	03	31	Neurochem Res	Zhu	Tingting
35317444	10.3892/etm.2022.11208	Effects and early diagnostic value of lncRNA H19 on sepsis-induced acute lung injury.	Sepsis is an immune disease induced by microbial invasion. The molecular mechanism and value of long non-coding H19 (lncRNA H19) in sepsis remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and early diagnostic value of lncRNA H19 on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Serum samples from 85 septic patients and 76 healthy individuals were collected, and the expression of lncRNA H19 was assessed by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in order to construct models of sepsis-induced ALI. A total of 18 successfully modeled rats were randomly allocated into an lncRNA H19-ad group and a model group, and another 9 healthy SD rats from the same batch were selected as a control group. The samples of serum and lung tissue were collected. lncRNA H19 expression was quantified by qPCR, and levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-17, caspase-3, caspase-9, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and BCL2-associated X (Bax) were measured by western blotting. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to assess the diagnostic value of lncRNA H19 for septic patients. lncRNA H19 was downregulated in sepsis. Upregulation of lncRNA H19 inhibited TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax and increased Bcl-2. The AUC of lncRNA H19 for early diagnosis of sepsis was 0.8197 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.91). lncRNA H19 alleviated sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting pulmonary apoptosis and inflammation, serving as a biochemical marker and therapeutic target for sepsis.	2022	03	24	Exp Ther Med	Zhou	You
35320477	10.1007/s11356-022-19747-1	Anticolitic activity of prodigiosin loaded with selenium nanoparticles on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease associated with extensive mucosal damage. Prodigiosins (PGs) are natural bacterial pigments with well-known antioxidant and immunosuppressive properties. In the current study, we examined the possible protective effect of PGs loaded with selenium nanoparticles (PGs-SeNPs) against acetic acid (AcOH)-induced UC in rats. Thirty-five rats were separated into five equal groups with seven animals/group: control, UC, PGs (300 mg/kg), sodium selenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mg/kg), PGs-SeNPs (0.5 mg/kg), and 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA, 200 mg/kg). Interestingly, PGs-SeNPs administration lessened colon inflammation and mucosal damage as indicated by inhibiting inflammatory markers upon AcOH injection. Furthermore, PGs-SeNPs improved the colonic antioxidant capacity and prevented oxidative insults as evidenced by the upregulation of Nrf2- and its downstream antioxidants along with the decreased pro-oxidants [reactive oxygen species (ROS), carbonyl protein, malondialdehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide (NO] in the colon tissue. Furthermore, PGs-SeNPs protected intestinal cell loss through blockade apoptotic cascade by decreasing pro-apoptotic proteins [Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3] and increasing anti-apoptotic protein, B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2). Collectively, PGs-SeNPs could be used as an alternative anti-colitic option due to their strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities.	2022	08	17	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Kassab	Rami B
35321563	10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317018	Plaque Evaluation by Ultrasound and Transcriptomics Reveals BCLAF1 as a Regulator of Smooth Muscle Cell Lipid Transdifferentiation in Atherosclerosis.	Understanding the processes behind carotid plaque instability is necessary to develop methods for identification of patients and lesions with stroke risk. Here, we investigated molecular signatures in human plaques stratified by echogenicity as assessed by duplex ultrasound. Lesion echogenicity was correlated to microarray gene expression profiles from carotid endarterectomies (n=96). The findings were extended into studies of human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions in situ, followed by functional investigations in vitro in human carotid smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Pathway analyses highlighted muscle differentiation, iron homeostasis, calcification, matrix organization, cell survival balance, and <i>BCLAF1</i> (BCL2 [B-cell lymphoma 2]-associated transcription factor 1) as the most significant signatures. <i>BCLAF1</i> was downregulated in echolucent plaques, positively correlated to proliferation and negatively to apoptosis. By immunohistochemistry, BCLAF1 was found in normal medial SMCs. It was repressed early during atherogenesis but reappeared in CD68+ cells in advanced plaques and interacted with BCL2 by proximity ligation assay. In cultured SMCs, <i>BCLAF1</i> was induced by differentiation factors and mitogens and suppressed by macrophage-conditioned medium. <i>BCLAF1</i> silencing led to downregulation of BCL2 and SMC markers, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Transdifferentiation of SMCs by oxLDL (oxidized low-denisty lipoprotein) was accompanied by upregulation of BCLAF1, CD36, and CD68, while oxLDL exposure with <i>BCLAF1</i> silencing preserved MYH (myosin heavy chain) 11 expression and prevented transdifferentiation. <i>BCLAF1</i> was associated with expression of cell differentiation, contractility, viability, and inflammatory genes, as well as the scavenger receptors <i>CD36</i> and <i>CD68</i>. BCLAF1 expression in CD68+/BCL2+ cells of SMC origin was verified in plaques from MYH11 lineage-tracing atherosclerotic mice. Moreover, <i>BCLAF1</i> downregulation associated with vulnerability parameters and cardiovascular risk in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Plaque echogenicity correlated with enrichment of distinct molecular pathways and identified <i>BCLAF1</i>, previously not described in atherosclerosis, as the most significant gene. Functionally, BCLAF1 seems necessary for survival and transdifferentiation of SMCs into a macrophage-like phenotype. The role of BCLAF1 in plaque vulnerability should be further evaluated.	2022	04	29	Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol	Rykaczewska	Urszula
35322932	10.1002/cam4.4692	Patient-reported outcomes provide prognostic information for survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Analysis of 1239 patients from the GOYA study.	We investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving obinutuzumab/rituximab plus chemotherapy in the GOYA phase III study. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) lymphoma subscale (LYMS) during the study. PRO scales with high prognostic value were identified through Cox regression analyses of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). These scales were evaluated in terms of their additional prognostic value beyond the International Prognostic Index (IPI). A preliminary assessment was performed to evaluate whether the scales provided improved patient-risk stratification beyond IPI. One thousand two hundred and fifty-nine patients with valid pretreatment PRO scales were included in the analyses, and complete pretreatment data were available for 1239/1414 patients (87.6%). Four PRO scales with high prognostic value were identified: FACT-Lym LYMS and EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning, global health status/quality of life (QoL), and fatigue. All four scales retained significant prognostic value for OS and PFS after IPI adjustment (all p &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for multiple clinical variables (IPI, cell of origin, BCL2 status, and total metabolic tumor volume), all four scales retained significant prognostic value (all p &lt; 0.05) for OS. Only the EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale was significant (p &lt; 0.05) for PFS after adjustment for multiple clinical variables. In this large population of patients with DLBCL, pretreatment PROs provided prognostic information for OS and PFS beyond the well-established IPI.	2022	09	13	Cancer Med	Huang	Huang
35324708	10.3390/toxins14030211	Protective Effects of Taraxasterol against Deoxynivalenol-Induced Damage to Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells.	Deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin produced by <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, is one of the most prevalent contaminants in livestock feed and causes very large losses to animal husbandry every year. Taraxasterol, isolated from <i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and antitumor effects. In the present study, bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) were used as a model, and different concentrations of taraxasterol (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg/mL) were used to protect against DON-induced cell damage. The results showed that taraxasterol at a concentration of 10 μg/mL significantly increased cell viability. Analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels indicated that taraxasterol substantially decreased LDH release caused by DON. Taraxasterol effectively alleviated the depletion of glutathione (GSH), the increase in the lipid peroxidation of malondialdehyde (MDA), the reduction in total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, and the decrease in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) induced by DON. The results further showed that taraxasterol reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taraxasterol was found to relieve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by suppressing the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and reducing cell apoptosis by suppressing the expression of caspase-3 and Bcl2-associated X (BAX) and upregulating the expression of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Our research results indicate that taraxasterol could alleviate DON-induced damage to MAC-T cells.	2022	04	22	Toxins (Basel)	Wang	Junxiong
35331723	10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.174907	Novel vandetanib derivative inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of cancer cells under normoxia and hypoxia.	Over-expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor were frequently associated with the metastasis of solid tumors. Vandetanib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, was broadly effective in treating a variety of human solid tumors. The compelling evidence that hypoxia is involved in tumor resistance to cancer therapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), a major transcription factor in response to hypoxia, has been considered as a promising specific target for cancer therapy. We reported a stronger vandetanib derivative, compound 39, which was more potently decreased viability of A549, HT-29, MCF-7, HepG2, and HeLa cells than its parent compound vandetanib. Remarkable hypoxia-selectivity was observed in A549 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.55 ± 0.23 μM under normoxia and 0.31 ± 0.06 μM under hypoxia, respectively) and HT-29 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.89 ± 2.15 μM under normoxia and 3.47 ± 0.79 μM under hypoxia, respectively). The apoptosis of A549 and HT-29 cells induced by compound 39 were detected by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis demonstrated that compound 39 significantly down-regulated the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein and up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2-Associated X (Bax) protein as well as promoted the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP. HIF-1α was down-regulated by compound 39 in A549 and HT-29 cells under hypoxia. We also found that the depletion of intracellular Reduced Glutathione (GSH) as well as production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) were critical for compound 39-mediated cell death.	2022	04	12	Eur J Pharmacol	Yin	Lijuan
35339405	10.1016/j.clml.2022.02.005	SOHO State of the Art Updates and Next Questions: Targeted therapies and emerging novel treatment approaches for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare hematologic malignancy characterized by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells involving the bone marrow and production of a monoclonal IgM paraprotein. Recurrent somatic mutations in MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> and CXCR4 have been reported in 90% to 95% and 30% to 40% of patients with WM, respectively. Standard treatment regimens combine the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab with alkylating agents (eg, bendamustine, cyclophosphamide), nucleoside analogs (eg, fludarabine, cladribine), or proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib). Covalent BTK inhibitors (eg, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib) have shown to be safe and highly effective in patients with WM. Novel and promising agents in this disease include next-generation covalent BTK inhibitors (eg, tirabrutinib, orelabrutinib), non-covalent BTK inhibitors (eg, pirtobrutinib, ARQ531), BCL-2 antagonists (eg, venetoclax), and CXCR4-targeted agents (eg, mavorixafor, ulocuplumab), among others. Future studies will focus on developing fixed-duration combinations regimens with these novel agents aimed at increasing durable responses while minimizing toxicity and cost.	2022	07	19	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Sermer	David
35344084	10.1007/s00404-022-06531-2	Diagnostic and prognostic value of Bcl-2 in uterine leiomyosarcoma.	Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) may show loss of expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein. It has been suggested that Bcl-2 loss may both be a diagnostic marker and an unfavorable prognostic marker in uLMS. To define the diagnostic and prognostic value of Bcl-2 loss in uLMS through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic databases were searched from their inception to May 2020 for all studies assessing the diagnostic and prognostic value of Bcl-2 loss of immunohistochemical expression in uLMS. Data were extracted to calculate odds ratio (OR) for the association of Bcl-2 with uLMS vs leiomyoma variants and smooth-muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), and hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival; a p value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Eight studies with 388 patients were included. Loss of Bcl-2 expression in uLMS was not significantly associated with a diagnosis of uLMS vs leiomyoma variants and STUMP (OR = 2.981; p = 0.48). Bcl-2 loss was significantly associated with shorter overall survival in uLMS (HR = 3.722; p = 0.006). High statistical heterogeneity was observed in both analyses. Loss of Bcl-2 expression appears as a significant prognostic but not diagnostic marker in uLMS. The high heterogeneity observed highlights the need for further research and larger studies.	2022	03	28	Arch Gynecol Obstet	Travaglino	Antonio
35346194	10.1186/s12951-022-01377-x	Multifunctional nanoparticles co-loaded with Adriamycin and MDR-targeting siRNAs for treatment of chemotherapy-resistant esophageal cancer.	The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) during cancer chemotherapy is a major challenge in current cancer treatment strategies. Numerous molecular mechanisms, including increased drug efflux, evasion of drug-induced apoptosis, and activation of DNA repair mechanisms, can drive chemotherapy resistance. Here we have identified the major vault protein (MVP) and the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) gene as two potential factors driving MDR in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We have designed a novel and versatile self-assembling nanoparticle (NP) platform on a multifunctional carboxymethyl chitosan base to simultaneously deliver Adriamycin, and siRNAs targeting MVP and BCL2 (CEAMB NPs), thus reducing drug efflux and promoting apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells. To achieve effective delivery to tumor tissues and inhibit tumor growth in vivo, carboxymethyl chitosan was engineered to contain multiple histidines for enhanced cytosol delivery, cholesterol for improved self-assembly, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies to target cancer cells. Our results indicate that these nanoparticles are efficiently synthesized with the desired chemical composition to self-assemble into cargo-containing NPs. Furthermore, we have shown that the synthesized NPs will successfully inhibit cancer cells growth and tumor development when delivered to cultured ESCC cells or to in vivo mouse xenograft models. Our engineered NPs offer a potential novel platform in treating various types of chemotherapy-resistant tumors.	2022	03	30	J Nanobiotechnology	Zhang	Xiangyang
35347000	10.21873/anticanres.15658	Satraplatin Demonstrates High Cytotoxic Activity Against Genetically Defined Lymphoid Malignancies.	Satraplatin is an oral platinum analog with proven clinical efficacy and a more favorable toxicity profile, although with increased hematotoxicity, when compared to cisplatin. Hence, we carried out a systematic biomarker analysis to identify hematological malignancies with high susceptibility to satraplatin. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) for satraplatin and cisplatin were determined for 66 different cancer cell lines by CTG Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. In a second step, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and whole-exome DNA sequencing technology followed by unbiased analysis of gene expression, gene mutation and copy number levels were performed and correlated with drug efficacy. Satraplatin was significantly more active against hematological malignancies compared to solid organ cancer. In addition, satraplatin showed a significantly more potent antiproliferative activity compared to cisplatin in most lymphoma cell lines achieving sub micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. Single BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2) gene mutation and 9p21 copy-number deletions including S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) deficiency were identified as key characteristics for high sensitivity to satraplatin. Satraplatin demonstrated a high cytotoxic activity in genetically well-defined hematological malignancies which is distinct from that of cisplatin. MTAP deficiency was identified as biomarker of enhanced satraplatin efficacy in hematological cancer-derived cell lines. These data in combination with the lipophilicity of satraplatin provide the rationale for targeting specific lymphatic entities such as primary central nervous system lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to improve clinical outcome.	2022	04	04	Anticancer Res	Zander	Thilo
35350909	10.1177/10781552221090869	Real-world management of targeted therapies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	The advent of novel targeted therapies, including B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors, has substantially changed the treatment paradigm for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although targeted therapies have improved outcomes compared to traditional chemoimmunotherapy in the front-line and relapsed or refractory settings, they are associated with resistance mutations and suboptimal outcomes in certain high-risk patients. Additionally, targeted therapies are associated with drug interactions and unique adverse effect profiles which can be challenging for patients and clinicians to manage. Ongoing studies continue to address questions regarding optimal sequencing of therapies, the role of treatment combinations, and the efficacy of next-generation novel agents. This review provides a comprehensive overview regarding the clinical management of targeted therapies for CLL and applies current literature to clinical practice.	2022	08	15	J Oncol Pharm Pract	Weis	Taylor M
35365988		[Protective effect of nuclear receptor related 1 (Nurr1) on nerves in rats with cerebral occlusion/reperfusion injury and its mechanism].	Objective To investigate the protective effect of nuclear receptor related 1 (Nurr1) on nerves in rats with cerebral occlusion/reperfusion injury and its mechanism. Methods Healthy male SD rats were chosen to construct the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. All rats were randomly divided into control group, model group, negative virus group, and Nurr1 over-expression group. Longa's modified neurological severity score, Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and immunofluorescence histochemical staining were applied respectively to detect the neurological injury, infarct volume, and density of microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) positive nerve cells in rats after MCAO/R. Related kits were used to detect the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). The protein levels of Nurr1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and Bcl2-assaciated X protein (BAX) were detected by Western blot. Results Nurr1 over-expression improved the neurological outcome with lower modified neurological severity scores by decreasing infarct volume, content of MDA, and expressions of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1β, and pro-apoptosis related protein BAX. Nurr1 over-expression significantly increased the density of MAP2 positive nerve cells, activity of SOD, and the expression of anti-apoptosis related protein Bcl2. Conclusion Nurr1 may alleviate the cerebral ischemic damage by resisting oxidation, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway-mediated cell apoptosis.	2022	04	05	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Hu	Di
35365989		[Inhibition of autophagy enhances apoptosis induced by doxorubicin hydrochloride in human colon cancer cells].	Objective To investigate the possible mechanism of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) inhibiting the proliferation of HT29 and HCT15 colon cancer cells. Methods The gradient concentrations of (0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.28) μmol/L DOX were used to treat HT29 and HCT15 cells for 24, 48 and 72 hours, and the cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK-8 assay to determine the optimal DOX concentration and treatment time. According to different treatments, HT29 and HCT15 cells were divided into 2 groups: control group (only DMSO treatment) and (0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.28) μmol/L DOX group. Western blot was used to detect the effect of inhibiting autophagy on apoptosis, with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) group and 3-MA combined with DOX group supplemented. The colony formation of colon cancer cells was detected by colony formation assay, and the expression of cell B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX), beclin 1, and LC3 protein were detected by Western blot. Results DOX inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of colon cancer cells, and promoted cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner; DOX promoted autophagy in cells, and the expression of beclin 1 and LC3 II increased in a concentration-dependent manner; DOX promoted apoptosis of colon cancer cells, which was improved by inhibiting autophagy. Conclusion DOX inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells and promotes their apoptosis, and inhibition of autophagy in colon cancer cells can increase the sensitivity of apoptosis induced by DOX.	2022	04	05	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Tang	Hongting
35366141	10.1007/s10495-022-01723-2	Targeting lysophosphatidic acid receptor with Ki16425 impedes T cell lymphoma progression through apoptosis induction, glycolysis inhibition, and activation of antitumor immune response.	Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a small phospholipid that acts as an extracellular lipid mediator. It promotes cancer progression by altering a wide array of cellular processes, including apoptosis, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and migration through binding with its cognate receptors. Intriguingly, our previous study showed that in vitro treatment of LPA induced survival of T lymphoma cells. Hence, the present investigation was designed to investigate the antitumor potential of Ki16425, an antagonist of LPA receptors, against T cell lymphoma. Our in vitro results showed inhibition of LPA-mediated survival and metabolic activity of T lymphoma cells by Ki16425. Further, in vivo experimental findings indicated the tumor retarding potential of Ki16425 against T cell lymphoma through apoptosis induction, glycolysis inhibition, and immunoactivation. The administration of Ki16425 triggered apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of Bcl2 and up-regulating p53, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and Cyt c expression. Further, Ki16425 suppressed glycolytic activity with concomitantly decreased expression of GLUT3 and MCT1. Moreover, we also noticed an elevated level of NO and iNOS in tumor cells after Ki16425 administration which might also be responsible for apoptosis induction and suppressed glycolysis. Additionally, we observed an increased population of total leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes along with increased thymocytes count and IL-2 and IFN-γ levels. Besides, we observed amelioration of tumor-induced kidney and liver damages by Ki16425. Taken together, this is the first study that demonstrates that LPA receptors could be potential future therapeutic targets for designing promising therapeutic strategies against T cell lymphoma.	2022	05	27	Apoptosis	Gupta	Vishal Kumar

Clinical practice guidelines by the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL), a joint venture of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the International Immunocompromised Host Society (ICHS) and the European Leukemia Net (ELN).	The 9th web-based European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-9), held September 16-17, 2021, reviewed the risk of infections and febrile neutropenia associated with more recently approved immunotherapeutic agents and molecular targeted drugs for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Novel antibody based treatment approaches (inotuzumab ozogamicin, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, flotetuzumab), isocitrate dehydrogenases inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib, olutasidenib), FLT3 kinase inhibitors (gilteritinib, midostaurin, quizartinib), a hedgehog inhibitor (glasdegib) as well as a BCL2 inhibitor (venetoclax) were reviewed with respect to their mode of action, their immunosuppressive potential, their current approval and the infectious complications and febrile neutropenia reported from clinical studies. Evidence-based recommendations for prevention and management of infectious complications and specific alerts regarding the potential for drug-drug interactions were developed and discussed in a plenary session with the panel of experts until consensus was reached. The set of recommendations was posted on the ECIL website for a month for comments from members of EBMT, EORTC, ICHS and ELN before final approval by the panelists. While a majority of these agents are not associated with a significantly increased risk when used as monotherapy, caution is required with combination therapy such as venetoclax plus hypomethylating agents, gemtuzumab ozogamicin plus cytotoxic drugs or midostaurin added to conventional AML chemotherapy.	2022	05	04	Leukemia	Maschmeyer	Georg
35370290	10.1038/s41392-022-00915-1	Identification of NOXA as a pivotal regulator of resistance to CAR T-cell therapy in B-cell malignancies.	Despite the remarkable success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for treating hematologic malignancies, resistance and recurrence still occur, while the markers or mechanisms underlying this resistance remain poorly understood. Here, via an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we identified loss of NOXA, a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family protein in B-cell malignancies, as a pivotal regulator of resistance to CAR T-cell therapy by impairing apoptosis of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, low NOXA expression in tumor samples was correlated with worse survival in a tandem CD19/20 CAR T clinical trial in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma. In contrast, pharmacological augmentation of NOXA expression by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors dramatically sensitized cancer cells to CAR T cell-mediated clearance in vitro and in vivo. Our work revealed the essentiality of NOXA in resistance to CAR T-cell therapy and suggested NOXA as a predictive marker for response and survival in patients receiving CAR T-cell transfusions. Pharmacological targeting of NOXA might provide an innovative therapeutic strategy to enhance CAR T-cell therapy.	2022	04	05	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Yan	Xin
35371331	10.7150/jca.69639	Clinical relevance of serum-derived exosomal messenger RNA sequencing in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	<b>Background:</b> The clinical utility of mRNA cargo in exosomes is unclear, although exosomes have potential as non-invasive biomarkers. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of exosomal mRNA sequencing for monitoring disease status and predicting outcomes in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. <b>Methods:</b> Exosomes were isolated from archived serum samples of 33 patients with NHL who were registered into our prospective cohort: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n = 17), intravascular B-cell lymphoma (IVL, n = 1), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL, n = 4), follicular lymphoma (FL, n = 3), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n = 3), and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL, n = 5). Exosomal mRNA sequencing was performed, and its concordance with clinical course was analyzed and compared with those of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutations. <b>Results:</b> Exosomal mRNA sequencing was performed successfully in 26 cases (79%, 26/33), whereas the remaining seven cases were not completed due to their small amount of RNA. The exosomal mRNA sequencing of DLBCL showed gene expression profiles consistent with activated B-cell-like and germinal center type. The longitudinal assessment of exosomal mRNA sequencing results in accordance with the clinical course showed that the post-treatment changes of exosomal mRNA expression were more consistent with treatment outcome than were those of ctDNA mutations. In particular, the exosomal mRNA expression of genes such as <i>BCL2</i> and <i>BCL6</i> was increased at the time of disease progression in DLBCL and FL patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrated the feasibility of exosomal mRNA expression profiles as a biomarker for NHL patients. Our results might provide the rationale for studies to explore the potential of exosomal mRNA as a biomarker in NHL patients.	2022	04	05	J Cancer	Bang	Yeong Hak
35379357	10.1186/s40364-022-00357-5	Combining BTK inhibitors with BCL2 inhibitors for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma.	The advent of BTK inhibitors has changed the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The first-in-class BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has shown remarkable therapeutic effects and manageable toxicities in multiple clinical trials. The second-generation BTK inhibitors, including acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, also show remarkable efficacies. However, using BTK inhibitors as monotherapies requires continuous treatment. Resistance to BTK inhibitors and severe side effects unavoidably occur during BTK inhibitor monotherapy, frequently resulting in treatment failure. The addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax to BTK inhibitor may improve the therapeutic effects and result in deeper responses, providing a potential fixed-duration treatment, especially for patients with CLL. In this review, by focusing on CLL and MCL, we discussed the rationale for the combinational use and summarized the current data on the combinations of BTK inhibitors and venetoclax in patients with CLL and MCL.	2022	04	08	Biomark Res	Zhang	Jing
35381283	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.03.212	Molecular characterization, expression and anti-tumor function analysis of yak IFITM2 gene.	IFITM2 is interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2, which plays an extremely key role in anti-tumor and anti-virus diseases. In this study, the 602 bp cDNA sequence of the yak (Bos grunniens) IFITM2 (BgIFITM2) gene was obtained. Moreover, the prokaryotic expression vector of BgIFITM2 protein was constructed and expressed successfully, with a molecular weight of 33.680 kDa. The proliferation activities and migration abilities of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treatment with BgIFITM2 protein (0.1 and 1 μg/mL) (P &lt; 0.05). The expressions of B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2)/BCL2-associated X (BAX) and molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes were significantly decreased, but the expressions of BAX gene were significantly increased after treatment with BgIFITM2 protein (0.1 and 1 μg/mL) (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of BAX protein was also significantly increased after treatment with 1 μg/mL BgIFITM2 protein (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, the addition of BgIFITM2 protein attenuated the formation of tumor lesions in mice, and the pathological damage of the lung was less than that in the model group. The expression of Ki67 protein in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), but the expression of Ki67 protein in the BgIFITM2 group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P &lt; 0.05). Taken together, BgIFITM2 protein could inhibit the proliferative activity of HepG2 cells by regulating apoptosis-related genes, and reduce the invasiveness of HepG2 cells in mice lung tissue. These results facilitate further studies on the function of BgIFITM2 protein.	2022	05	17	Int J Biol Macromol	Wang	Haipeng
35393909	10.1080/09513590.2022.2061454	Effects of clinical and metabolic variables and hormones on the expression of immune protein biomarkers in the endometrium of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and normal-cycling controls.	Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at an elevated risk of endometrial cancer, which may be associated with the continuous proliferative state caused by the interaction between hormones and metabolic factors. To investigate the impact of hormones and metabolic factors in the proliferation and death of endometrium during the proliferative phase. Cross-sectional study with 11 women with PCOS and eight normal-cycling non-PCOS controls at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro from February 2011 to June 2019. Clinical, biochemical, and hormonal data were collected to analyze their influence on the expression of biomarkers related to the endometrial tissue breakdown. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsies were conducted, and the endometrial samples underwent immunohistochemistry for markers of apoptosis B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3), fas cell surface death receptor (FAS), FAS ligand (FASLG), BCL2 associated X (BAX), marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67), and cell death using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick and labeling (TUNEL). CASP3 and TUNEL expressions were lower in both stroma and endometrium gland of PCOS women than in controls. MKI67 and homeostasis indexes (BCL2/BAX; FASLG/FAS) in the endometrium of the PCOS group were significantly higher. Body mass index (BMI) values were positively correlated with the expression of MKI67 and MKI67/TUNEL ratio in the endometrial stroma compartment. Fasting insulin levels were positively correlated with the expression of BCL2, and DHEA-S levels were negatively correlated with the expression of CASP3 of women with PCOS. BMI, insulin, and DHEA-S influence the endometrial homeostasis breakdown in PCOS in the endometrium stroma.	2022	06	06	Gynecol Endocrinol	Giordano	Luiz Augusto
35411095	10.1038/s41375-022-01558-5	JAK3 mutations and mitochondrial apoptosis resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis predicts inferior treatment outcomes in patients with diverse tumor types, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, the genetic basis for variability in this mitochondrial apoptotic phenotype is poorly understood, preventing its rational therapeutic targeting. Using BH3 profiling and exon sequencing analysis of childhood T-ALL clinical specimens, we found that mitochondrial apoptosis resistance was most strongly associated with activating mutations of JAK3. Mutant JAK3 directly repressed apoptosis in leukemia cells, because its inhibition with mechanistically distinct pharmacologic inhibitors resulted in reversal of mitochondrial apoptotic blockade. Inhibition of JAK3 led to loss of MEK, ERK and BCL2 phosphorylation, and BH3 profiling revealed that JAK3-mutant primary T-ALL patient samples were characterized by a dependence on BCL2. Treatment of JAK3-mutant T-ALL cells with the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib in combination with a spectrum of conventional chemotherapeutics revealed synergy with glucocorticoids, in vitro and in vivo. These findings thus provide key insights into the molecular genetics of mitochondrial apoptosis resistance in childhood T-ALL, and a compelling rationale for a clinical trial of JAK3 inhibitors in combination with glucocorticoids for patients with JAK3-mutant T-ALL.	2022	06	06	Leukemia	Bodaar	Kimberly

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for tissue regeneration and disease treatment. However, long-term in vitro passaging leads to stemness loss of MSCs, resulting in failure of MSC therapy. This study investigated whether the combination of melatonin and human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) was superior to hUC-MSCs alone in ameliorating high-fat diet and streptozocin (STZ)-induced type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a mouse model. Mice were divided into four groups: normal control (NC) group; T2DM group; hUC-MSCs treatment alone (UCMSC) group and pretreatment of hUC-MSCs with melatonin (UCMSC/Mel) group. RNA sequence analysis showed that certain pathways, including the signaling pathway involved in the regulation of cell proliferation signaling pathway, were regulated by melatonin. The blood glucose levels of the mice in the UCMSC and UCMSC/Mel treatment groups were significantly reduced compared with the T2DM group without treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, hUC-MSCs enhance the key factor in the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in T2DM mouse hepatocytes. The pretreatment of hUC-MSCs with melatonin partly boosted cell efficiency and thereby alleviated impaired glycemic control and insulin resistance. This study provides a practical strategy to improve the application of hUC-MSCs in diabetes mellitus and cytotherapy. Overview of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (A) Underlying mechanism of UCMSC/Mel inhibition of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance T2DM mice via regulation of PI3K/AKT pathway. hUC-MSCs stimulates glucose uptake and improves insulin action thus should inhibition the clinical signs of T2DM, through activation of the p-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and then regulates glucose transport through activating AS160. UCMSC/Mel increases p53-dependent expression of BCL2, and inhibit BAX and Capase3 protein activation. Leading to the decrease in apoptosis. (B) Melatonin modulated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Melatonin activated PI3K/AKT response pathway through binding to MT1and MT2 receptor.

35414839		Primary ovarian Burkitt lymphoma: report of a case and review of literature.	We report a case of primary ovarian Burkitt lymphoma that occurred in a 25-year-old woman. The patient complained of a mass in the right ovary discerned by physical examination 2 months prior. Ultrasound examination indicated that the right ovary was enlarged and abundant blood flow signals were observed. Right salpingo-oophorectomy was subsequently performed. Histology was characterized by diffuse sheets of monotonous medium-sized lymphoid cells with plentiful mitotic figures and apoptosis. Numerous tingible-body macrophages were found in the ovarian tissue, presenting a starry sky pattern. The tumor cells expressed CD20, CD10, <i>BCL</i>6 and <i>MYC</i> in the absence of <i>BCL2</i>. Ki-67 proliferative index was very high with a proliferation rate of near 100%. <i>MYC</i> (8q24) rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with no <i>BCL2</i> (18q21) and <i>BCL6</i> (3q37) gene rearrangements. Cumulative evidence established primary ovarian Burkitt lymphoma as the final histopathologic diagnosis with clinical stage I (FIGO). The patient received HyperCVAD chemotherapy after surgery and remained complete response (CR) for 18 months. We aim to provide insight into the future treatment of this rare but lethal disease.	2022	04	14	Int J Clin Exp Pathol	Xu	Hongliang
35422931		HGF induces oncoprotein HCCR-1 expression through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in gastric cancer.	Human cervical cancer oncogene (HCCR)-1, previously identified in cervical cancer and its cell lines, has been reported to play an important role in tumor progression in several cancers as a suppressor of apoptosis. However, the role of <i>HCCR-1</i> in the tumorigenesis of stomach cancer has not been identified. This study examined the role of <i>HCCR-1</i> as a suppressor of apoptosis during tumorigenesis in gastric cancer, along with its possible regulatory pathway. We employed several techniques including western blotting, semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and <i>HCCR-1</i> knockdown with short hairpin RNA to elucidate the role of <i>HCCR-1</i>. We observed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) upregulated <i>HCCR-1</i> expression. In addition, the expression levels of β-catenin, T cell factor-1 (TCF1), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>bcl2</i>) were increased, whereas that of tumor protein 53 (<i>p53</i>) was decreased following HGF treatment. <i>HCCR-1</i> knockdown in NUGC-3 and MKN-28 cells decreased the expression of TCF1 and phosphorylated β-catenin and increased the binding activity on the binding site of the <i>HCCR-1</i> promoter. This identifies the possible involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in HGF-induced <i>HCCR-1</i> regulation. We also confirmed the role of <i>HCCR-1</i> in HGF-induced anti-apoptotic activity. p53 protein expression was increased, whereas that of bcl2 was decreased with HGF treatment in <i>HCCR-1</i> knockdown cells, while the apoptotic activity was increased. Our study suggests the anti-apoptotic activity of HGF-induced <i>HCCR-1</i> expression and that HGF may regulate HCCR-1 via TCF1/β-catenin in stomach cancer.	2022	04	16	Am J Transl Res	Koh	Sung Ae
35425994	10.3892/mmr.2022.12710	Preparation of Nereid oligopeptide and investigation of the mechanism underlying the induction of apoptosis in human lung cancer H1299 cells.	In the present study, oligopeptides from Nereid (<i>Perinereis aibuhitensis</i>) were prepared via enzymatic hydrolysis, and the mechanism underlying the induction of apoptosis in H1299 cells was investigated. According to the analysis of the inhibition rate on proliferation, alkaline protease demonstrated the best enzymatic efficiency. The optimal conditions for hydrolysis were as follows: 50˚C and pH 10 for 6 h; a material‑to‑liquid ratio of 1:1 (g/ml); and addition of 400 U/g enzyme. The hydrolysates were purified using ultrafiltration, anion chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and high‑performance liquid chromatography. The Nereid oligopeptide (NOP), with a molecular weight of 841 kDa and an amino acid sequence of glutamine‑isoleucine‑asparagine‑glutamine‑histidine‑leucine, was obtained. NOP inhibited the proliferation of H1299 cells in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Morphological changes and apoptosis were also induced by NOP in H1299 cells. The western blot analysis revealed that the B‑cell lymphoma 2/Bcl‑2 associated X (Bcl‑2/Bax) ratio was reduced by 24.7% in the NOP treatment group compared with the control group. The relative expression levels of cleaved caspase‑9 (cleaved‑CASP9) and cleaved caspase‑3 (cleaved‑CASP3) in the NOP treatment group were 2.55‑ and 1.71‑fold higher than those measured in the control group, respectively. These results suggested that NOP exerts antitumor effects by influencing the proliferation and apoptosis of H1299 cells.	2022	04	18	Mol Med Rep	Zhang	Guomei

The few cases reported in the literature of MALT lymphomas affecting the ileum are in patients who are already symptomatic and with clear advanced endoscopic findings. We present the first case of an asymptomatic female patient who underwent colonoscopy as a routine examination with the findings of an ulcer in the distal ileum region, which histopathological examination and associated immunohistochemistry revealed the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma. A 57-year-old asymptomatic female patient underwent a colonoscopy exam for screening. The examination revealed an ulcer of medium depth with well-defined borders covered by a thin layer of fibrin and a halo of hyperemia in the distal ileum portion. Findings are nonspecific but may signal infections by viruses, protozoa, and parasites or inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. Biopsies of the ulcer were taken. The anatomopathological result revealed an atypical diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate of small cells with a characteristic cytoplasmic halo of marginal zone cells. The immunohistochemical study was performed and the results demonstrated a negative neoplastic infiltrate for the expression of cyclin D1 and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and a positive for BCL60 in the germinal center. The test also revealed CD10 positivity in the glandular epithelium and germinal center of a reactive follicle with dual-labeling of CD20 and CD3 demonstrating the B lymphocyte nature of the neoplastic infiltrate. In BCL2 protein labeling, the neoplastic infiltrate is strongly positive with a negative germinal center. The findings are consistent with immunophenotype B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, better classified as extranodal MALT. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and showed complete regression of the disease, as evidenced by colonoscopy performed after treatment. MALT lymphomas in the terminal ileum are extremely rare and only 4 cases have been reported in the literature. Given the low sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic images in these cases, the pathology can be confused with other important differential diagnoses such as inflammatory diseases or infectious diseases and which makes the biopsy important, even in asymptomatic patients, paired with anatomopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry which is the gold standard for correct diagnosis.	2022	04	19	World J Gastrointest Endosc	de Figueiredo	Vitor Lauar Pimenta
35435120	10.1080/21655979.2022.2061283	CircSETD3 (hsa_circ_0000567) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells via downregulation of microRNA-421 expression.	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal tumor associated with chronic inflammation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been evidenced to be involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This study aimed to explore the effects and potential molecular mechanism of circSETD3 in CCA progression. Levels of CircSETD3 and microRNA (miR)-421 in CCA tissue and cell lines were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A direct target of miR-421 was predicted using TargetScan and further confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The activity of caspase-3 was also examined using caspase-3 activity detection kits. Moreover, the levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 modifying factor (<i>BMF</i>), B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>BCL2</i>), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (<i>BAX</i>) in TFK1 cells were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. We found that circSETD3 was downregulated, while miR-421 was upregulated in CCA tissues and cell lines. CircSETD3 negatively regulated miR-421 levels in TFK1 cells. Functional assays revealed that circSETD3-plasmid inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, promoted caspase-3 activity, enhanced Bax and cleaved-Caspase 3 expression, and reduced Bcl-2 levels, and these effects were reversed by miR-421 mimic. Meanwhile, similar results were observed in miR-421 inhibitor-transfected TFK1 cells, and these results were abolished by BMF-siRNA. BMF, a direct target of miR-421, was downregulated in CCA tissues and cell lines. These findings demonstrate that circSETD3 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in CCA cells by regulating the miR-421/BMF axis, indicating its potential as a promising candidate for CCA therapy.	2022	04	19	Bioengineered	Xiong	Wei
35435617	10.1007/s11864-022-00953-5	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Chemotherapy Free and Other Novel Therapies Including CAR T.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. Most individuals diagnosed with CLL will not need treatment immediately but over time the clonal B cells infiltrate the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing anemia, thrombocytopenia, systemic symptoms, and increased risk for infections. When clonal B cells begin adversely affecting other organs, treatment is warranted. Therapy for CLL has undergone a paradigm shift away from chemotherapy-based regimens to targeted therapy with small-molecule inhibitors. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays a key role in CLL. BCR signaling occurs via many factors including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate phosphodiesterase gamma-2 (PLCγ2), and CD19. CLL cells also express high levels of B-cell lymphoma or leukemia 2 (BCL2). Drugs that interfere with these pathways, such as ibrutinib, venetoclax, and idelalisib, have improved clinical outcomes. For any CLL patient that meets criteria for treatment, after evaluating for prognostic cytogenetic abnormalities, oral BTK inhibitors or venetoclax in combination with anti-CD20 therapy are considered first-line therapy. It is important to note that these novel therapies are particularly preferred for patients with TP53 mutations or deletion of the small arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)), as those patients usually are chemotherapy refractory or display short remissions to chemotherapy. Nevertheless, patients without high-risk features such as TP53 abnormalities also benefit from novel agents. Following relapse, depending on the primary oral agent used, BTK inhibitors, venetoclax in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies, or PI3K inhibitors are preferred.	2022	04	28	Curr Treat Options Oncol	Wiedmeier-Nutor	Julia
35436854	10.1186/s12863-022-01041-1	An alternative CYB5A transcript is expressed in aneuploid ALL and enriched in relapse.	B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is a genetically heterogenous malignancy with poor prognosis in relapsed adult patients. The genetic basis for relapse in aneuploid subtypes such as near haploid (NH) and high hyperdiploid (HeH) BCP-ALL is only poorly understood. Pathogenic genetic alterations remain to be identified. To this end, we investigated the dynamics of genetic alterations in a matched initial diagnosis-relapse (ID-REL) BCP-ALL cohort. Here, we firstly report the identification of the novel genetic alteration CYB5Aalt, an alternative transcript of CYB5A, in two independent cohorts. We identified CYB5alt in the RNAseq-analysis of a matched ID-REL BCP-ALL cohort with 50 patients and quantified its expression in various molecular BCP-ALL subtypes. Findings were validated in an independent cohort of 140 first diagnosis samples from adult BCP-ALL patients. Derived from patient material, the alternative open reading frame of CYB5Aalt was cloned (pCYB5Aalt) and pCYB5Aalt or the empty vector were stably overexpressed in NALM-6 cells. RNA sequencing was performed of pCYB5Aalt clones and empty vector controls followed by differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and complementing cell death and viability assays to determine functional implications of CYB5Aalt. RNAseq data analysis revealed non-canonical exon usage of CYB5Aalt starting from a previously undescribed transcription start site. CYB5Aalt expression was increased in relapsed BCP-ALL and its occurrence was specific towards the shared gene expression cluster of NH and HeH BCP-ALL in independent cohorts. Overexpression of pCYB5Aalt in NALM-6 cells induced a distinct transcriptional program compared to empty vector controls with downregulation of pathways related to reported functions of CYB5A wildtype. Interestingly, CYB5A wildtype expression was decreased in CYB5Aalt samples in silico and in vitro. Additionally, pCYB5Aalt NALM-6 elicited a more resistant drug response. Across all age groups, CYB5Aalt was the most frequent secondary genetic event in relapsed NH and HeH BCP-ALL. In addition to its high subgroup specificity, CYB5Aalt is a novel candidate to be potentially implicated in therapy resistance in NH and HeH BCP-ALL. This is underlined by overexpressing CYB5Aalt providing first evidence for a functional role in BCL2-mediated apoptosis.	2022	04	20	BMC Genom Data	Bartsch	Lorenz
35444774	10.4084/MJHID.2022.018	TdT Positive Lymphoma with MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 Rearrangements: A Review of Diagnosis and Treatment.	In the modern era, classification of neoplasms not only depends on immunomorphological features but also on specific disease-defining genetic events. Translocations/rearrangements of MYC/8q24 locus combined with BCL-2 or BCL6 translocations (double/triple hit) are considered hallmarks of high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), a type of aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma. When cases with immature immunophenotypes present these rearrangements, diagnosis becomes very difficult. We herein report an unusual case of an aggressive B-cell lymphoma/leukemia that presented with immature morphology and immunophenotype with triple hit gene rearrangements. This case highlights the difficulty in classifying and appropriately treating these patients. The novel aspect is the treatment and outcome with chimeric antigen receptor or <i>CAR T</i>-cell <i>therapy</i>.	2022	04	23	Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis	Singh	Aditi
35448884	10.3390/toxins14040275	Protective Effects of Ferulic Acid on Deoxynivalenol-Induced Toxicity in IPEC-J2 Cells.	Deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin that contaminates crops such as wheat and corn, can cause severe acute or chronic injury when ingested by animals or humans. This study investigated the protective effect of ferulic acid (FA), a polyphenolic substance, on alleviating the toxicity induced by DON (40 μM) in IPEC-J2 cells. The experiments results showed that FA not only alleviated the decrease in cell viability caused by DON (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), but increased the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), (catalase) CAT and glutathione (GSH) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-epoxy chloropropane Kelch sample related protein-1 (keap1) pathway, and then decreased the levels of intracellular oxidative stress. Additionally, FA could alleviate DON-induced inflammation through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathways, down-regulated the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and further attenuated the DON-induced intracellular apoptosis (10.7% to 6.84%) by regulating the expression of Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001), and caspase-3 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001). All these results indicate that FA exhibits a significantly protective effect against DON-induced toxicity.	2022	04	25	Toxins (Basel)	Meng	Xiangyi
35452696	10.1016/j.humpath.2022.04.002	B-cell lymphoma-2 downregulation is a useful feature supporting a neoplastic phenotype in mature T-cell lymphomas.	Normal T cells express high levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) protein, and data regarding BCL2 expression status and its diagnostic utility in T-cell lymphoma are scarce. We evaluated BCL2 expression in a series of mature T-cell lymphoproliferations (TCLs) including indolent and more recently recognized entities (follicular helper T-cell [TFH] lymphomas). Sixty-six neoplastic biopsies (60 patients) representing mature nodal, extranodal, and leukemia T-cell neoplasms were collected from three institutes (2 US and 1 Japan) and were compared with reactive T cells in 8 benign tissues/blood and 9 T cell-rich B-cell proliferations. BCL2 immunostaining was performed and scored based on intensity-weighted H-score (0-300). Next-generation sequencing (NGS; 5 cases), BCL2 gene sequencing, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; 3 cases) were conducted. Association of H-score with overall survival (using proportional hazards modeling) was assessed in nonleukemic TCLs. Most TCLs showed significantly downregulated median BCL2 H-score (125, range: 18-300) with the exception of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, both of which showed uniform strong retention of BCL2 as did the 8 reactive tissues (median H-score: 280; p = 0.000). Notably all TFH lymphoma CD4 neoplastic T cells, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, CD8 adipocyte-rimming T cells, and T-cell large lymphocyte leukemia with pathogenic STAT5B and TP53 mutation showed BCL2 downregulation. No BCL2 mutations were observed by NGS or sequencing with decreased BCL2 mRNA transcripts by real-time PCR. BCL2 downregulation is pervasive among many TCLs and unrelated to any mutations. There is utility for BCL2 immunostaining in some challenging situations as discussed in this article.	2022	06	14	Hum Pathol	Siddiqui	Faiza
35468679	10.31083/j.fbl2704120	Phytochemical Profiling of Microalgae <i>Euglena tuba</i> and Its Anticancer Activity in Dalton's Lymphoma Cells.	Natural phytochemicals are considered safe to use as therapeutic agents. There is a growing trend toward exploring anticancer effects of crude algal extracts or their active ingredients. <i>Euglena tuba</i>, a microalga, contains excellent antioxidant potential. However, the anticancer property of <i>E. tuba</i> has not been explored. This study investigates the chemical profiling as well as antitumor property of methanolic extract of <i>E. tuba</i> (ETME) against Dalton's lymphoma (DL) cells. <i>E. tuba</i>, procured from northern part of India, was extracted in 70% methanol, dried at room temperature, and stored at -20 ∘C for future use. A freshly prepared aqueous solution of ETME of different concentrations was employed into each experiment. The ETME mediated anti-tumor response in Dalton's lymphoma was evaluated in the inbred populations of BALB/c (H2d) strain of mice of either sex at 8-12 weeks of age. The cytotoxicity of ETME in cancer cells, effects on morphology of cell and nucleus, alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and level of expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, cyt C, Bax and p53) were done using known procedures. The ETME contained high content of total alkaloids (96.02 ± 3.30 mg/100 mg), flavonoids (15.77 ± 2.38 mg/100 mg), carbohydrate (12.71 ± 0.59 mg/100 mg), ascorbic acid (12.48 ± 2.59 mg/100 mg), and phenolics (0.94 ± 0.05 mg/100 mg). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated the presence of 23 phytochemicals with known anticancer properties. DL cells treated with ETME exhibited significant and concentration dependent cytotoxicity. Florescent microscopy and flow cytometry of ETME treated DL cells indicated significant repair in cellular morphology and decreased mitochondrial potential, respectively. Western blot analysis displayed up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Cyt-c, p53) and down regulation of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl2) in DL cells treated with ETME. The findings of this study clearly indicated that the anticancer property of ETME was mediated via reduction in mitochondrial potential and induction of apoptotic mechanism. Further studies are warranted to explore the anticancer activities of active ingredients present in this microalga of pharmaceutical importance.	2022	04	27	Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)	Gupta	Swati Prabha
35481444	10.1080/10428194.2022.2064988	Impact of autograft-absolute lymphocyte count on survival in double/triple hit lymphomas post-autologous stem cell transplantation.	The autograft absolute lymphocyte count (A-ALC) ≥0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/kg is a survival prognostic factor for lymphoma patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (APBHSCT). However, the A-ALC has not be tested as prognostic factor against double hit/triple hit lymphomas (DHL/THL). Thus, we set up to investigate if A-ALC is a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for DHL/THL post-APBHSCT. From January 2012 until December 2020, we identified 77 DHL/THL patients treated with APBHSCT. All patients required to have the diagnosis of DHL/THL by FISH for rearrangements of <i>MYC</i>, <i>BCL2,</i> and <i>BCL6.</i> With a median follow-up of 20.4 months (range, 0.4-94.5 months), DHL/THL patients infused with A-ALC ≥0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/kg experienced superior OS (HR = 0.251, 95%CI 0.117-0.539, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0004) and PFS (HR = 0.347, 95%CI 0.160-0.753, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that A-ALC was an independent predictor for OS (HR =0.119, 95%CI 0.030-0.473, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.003) and PFS (HR = 0.400, 95%CI 0.189-0.850, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). Our study showed that A-ALC is a prognostic factor for survival in DHL/THL. Our current practice for lymphoma patients is to collect enough stem cell but also A-ALC to improve clinical outcomes post-APBHSCT.	2022	05	16	Leuk Lymphoma	Porrata	Luis F
35482553	10.1002/hon.3010	Targeting MYC and BCL2 by a natural compound for ""double-hit"" lymphoma.	Concurrent translocations of MYC and BCL2 lead to abnormal expression of both oncoproteins, which contribute to the aggressive clinical characteristics of double-hit lymphoma (DHL). An effective therapy for DHL remains an unmet clinical need. In this study, we showed that both Ca<sup>2+</sup> /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ (CAMKIIδ) and γ (CAMKIIγ) were highly expressed in DHL. Both isoforms of CAMKII stabilize c-Myc protein by phosphorylating it at Ser62, increase BCL2 expression, and promote DHL tumor growth. Inhibition of CAMKIIδ and CAMKIIγ by either berbamine (BBM) or one of its derivatives (PA4) led to the down regulation of c-Myc and BCL2 proteins. BBM/PA4 also exhibited anti-tumor efficacy in DHL cell lines and NSG xenograft models. Altogether, CAMKIIδ and CAMKIIγ appear to be critical for DHL tumor development and are promising therapeutic targets for DHL.	2022	08	09	Hematol Oncol	Liu	Xiaoqian
35483927	10.5045/br.2022.2022037	Basic immunohistochemistry for lymphoma diagnosis.	Immunohistochemistry is a technique that uses antigen-antibody interactions to detect specific proteins in cells. This technique has several essential applications in lymphoma diagnosis, including identifying the cell lineage and phase of maturation, detecting specific genetic alterations, visualizing the degree of cell proliferation, and identifying therapeutic targets. CD3 is a pan T-cell marker expressed on most of the mature T/NK-cell lymphomas, except for anaplastic large cell lymphoma, whereas CD20 is a pan B-cell marker that is expressed on most of the mature B-cell lymphomas. CD79a may be a good alternative to CD20, compensating for its loss owing to the plasmocytic differentiation of tumor cells or history of rituximab administration. CD56, a neuroendocrine marker, is used as an NK cell marker in lymphoma diagnosis. Characteristic translocations occurring in follicular lymphoma (<i>BCL2</i>) and mantle cell lymphoma (<i>CCND1</i>) can be detected by the overexpression of Bcl-2 and cyclin D-1 in immunohistochemistry, respectively. Ki-67 reflects the degree of tumor cell proliferation by indicating cells in cell cycle phases other than G0. With the development of immunotherapy, several antibodies against markers such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), CD19, and CD30 have been used as biomarkers to identify therapeutic targets. It is critical to properly fix the specimens to obtain accurate immunohistochemical results. Therefore, all processes, from tissue collection to the final pathological diagnosis, must be performed appropriately for accurate lymphoma diagnosis.	2022	05	12	Blood Res	Cho	Junhun
35484682	10.3324/haematol.2021.280557	Molecular characterisation and clinical outcome of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with IG-MYC rearrangement.	Rarely, immunophenotypically immature B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) carries an immunoglobulin-MYC rearrangement (IG-MYC-r). This can result in diagnostic confusion with Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia and use of unproven individualised treatment schedules. Here we contrast the molecular characteristics of these conditions and investigate historic clinical outcome data. We identified 90 cases registered on a national BCP-ALL clinical trial/registry. Where present, diagnostic material underwent cytogenetic, exome, methylome and transcriptome analysis. Outcome was analysed to define 3-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). IG-MYC-r was identified in diverse cytogenetic backgrounds, co-existing with either: established BCP-ALL specific abnormalities (high hyperdiploidy n=3, KMT2A-rearrangement n=6, iAMP21 n=1, BCR-ABL n=1); BCL2/BCL6-rearrangements (n=15); or, most commonly, as the only defining feature (n=64). Within this final group, precursor-like V(D)J breakpoints predominated (8/9) and KRAS mutations were common (5/11). DNA methylation identified a cluster of V(D)J rearranged cases, clearly distinct from Burkitt leukaemia/lymphoma. Children with IG-MYC-r within that subgroup had 3-year EFS of 47% and OS of 60%, representing a high-risk BCP-ALL. To develop effective management strategies this patient group must be allowed access to contemporary, minimal residual disease adapted, prospective clinical trial protocols.	2022	05	06	Haematologica	Bomken	Simon
35489963	10.1016/j.blre.2022.100967	ABCs of ADCs in management of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	In the past 5 years, 3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, 2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), 1 CD19-directed monoclonal antibody, and 1 exportin-1 inhibitor have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The noncellular therapies received accelerated approval based on the overall response rate in clinical trials that differ in multiple aspects of the patient populations enrolled, including age, performance status, prior lines of therapy, and inclusion of patients with primary refractory DLBCL, transformed lymphoma, or high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6. ADCs approved for DLBCL differ in target antigen, antibody structure, linker, and cytotoxin, which results in a different safety and efficacy profile. Here, we comprehensively review the current knowledge of recently approved and emerging strategies for the management of R/R DLBCL with a focus on ADCs.	2022	04	30	Blood Rev	Alderuccio	Juan Pablo
35495111	10.1016/j.csbj.2022.03.023	Integrating whole genome sequencing, methylation, gene expression, topological associated domain information in regulatory mutation prediction: A study of follicular lymphoma.	A major challenge in human genetics is of the analysis of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in a multifactorial disease like cancer. Here, a novel methodology is proposed to investigate genome-wide regulatory mechanisms in cancer, as studied with the example of follicular Lymphoma (FL). In a first phase, a new machine-learning method is designed to identify Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) by computing six attributes. In a second phase, an integrative data analysis method is developed to study regulatory mutations in FL, by considering differential methylation information together with DNA sequence variation, differential gene expression, 3D organization of genome (e.g., topologically associated domains), and enriched biological pathways. Resulting mutation block-gene pairs are further ranked to find out the significant ones. By this approach, BCL2 and BCL6 were identified as top-ranking FL-related genes with several mutation blocks and DMRs acting on their regulatory regions. Two additional genes, CDCA4 and CTSO, were also found in top rank with significant DNA sequence variation and differential methylation in neighboring areas, pointing towards their potential use as biomarkers for FL. This work combines both genomic and epigenomic information to investigate genome-wide gene regulatory mechanisms in cancer and contribute to devising novel treatment strategies.	2022	07	16	Comput Struct Biotechnol J	Farooq	Amna
35498426	10.3389/fendo.2022.846357	Identification and Validation of a Prognostic Prediction Model in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group with varied pathophysiological, genetic, and clinical features, accounting for approximately one-third of all lymphoma cases worldwide. Notwithstanding that unprecedented scientific progress has been achieved over the years, the survival of DLBCL patients remains low, emphasizing the need to develop novel prognostic biomarkers for early risk stratification and treatment optimization. In this study, we screened genes related to the overall survival (OS) of DLBCL patients in datasets GSE117556, GSE10846, and GSE31312 using univariate Cox analysis. Survival-related genes among the three datasets were screened according to the criteria: hazard ratio (HR) &gt;1 or &lt;1 and <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.01. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to optimize and establish the final gene risk prediction model. The TCGA-NCICCR datasets and our clinical cohort were used to validate the performance of the prediction model. CIBERSORT and ssGSEA algorithms were used to estimate immune scores in the high- and low-risk groups. We constructed an eight-gene prognostic signature that could reliably predict the clinical outcome in training, testing, and validation cohorts. Our prognostic signature also performed distinguished areas under the ROC curve in each dataset, respectively. After stratification based on clinical characteristics such as cell-of-origin (COO), age, eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status, international prognostic index (IPI), stage, and MYC/BCL2 expression, the difference in OS between the high- and low-risk groups was statistically significant. Next, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the risk score model had a significant prediction value. Finally, a nomogram was established to visualize the prediction model. Of note, we found that the low-risk group was enriched with immune cells. In summary, we identified an eight-gene prognostic prediction model that can effectively predict survival outcomes of patients with DLBCL and built a nomogram to visualize the perdition model. We also explored immune alterations between high- and low-risk groups.	2022	05	03	Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)	Yan	Jiaqin
35504024	10.18632/aging.204041	<i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> anti-lymphoma effects of <i>Ophiorrhiza pumila</i> extract.	Current therapeutic strategies on patients with lymphomas remains limited. Previously we found the suppressive effect of <i>Ophiorrhiza pumila</i> (OPE) on hepatocarcinoma. In present study, the effect of OPE on lymphoma <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> were investigated. CCK-8 assay was applied to detect the effect of OPE on cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the effect of OPE on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Xenograft mouse model was conducted to determine the anti-tumor activity of OPE. TNUEL assay was performed to detect the apoptosis in tumor tissues. Western blot and immuno-histochemistry were used to determine protein expression. <i>In vitro</i> tests indicate that OPE suppressed A20 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. OPE treatment induced cell cycle arrest at S phase and elevated apoptosis in A20 cells. OPE displayed a significant inhibition in tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. OPE promoted apoptosis of tumor cell in the mouse model Cleaved caspase 3 expression and Bax/Bcl2 ratio were also enhanced. In addition, OPE suppressed A20 cell viability partially by reducing phosphorylation of EGFR. Our data showed that OPE suppressed the proliferation of lymphoma cells and promoted apoptosis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, which might be partially mediated by inactivating EGFR signaling.	2022	05	24	Aging (Albany NY)	Fan	Lixia
35510016	10.7759/cureus.23681	Incidental Pathogenic Fibrin-Associated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Found During Aorto-Biiliac Bypass.	Fibrin-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (FA-DLBCL) is in and of itself a rare entity and is a subset of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma. Due to its indolent course, FA-DLBCL is generally an incidental finding on histopathological examinations. We present the first reported case of FA-DLBCL found within a native aortic thrombus during an aorto-biiliac bypass. This is a 77-year-old male who was taken to the operative theater for open aorto-biiliac bypass secondary to aortooclusive disease resulting in intermittent claudication and gangrene of the right lower extremity digits. Intraoperatively, suspicious inflammatory changes were noted around the aorta. Pathological evaluation of the thrombus within the aorta noted cells of B-cell lineage with BCL2 and MYC positivity in addition to CD30 and EBV positivity. Postoperatively, the patient's course was complicated by acute tubular necrosis, uremia, dialysis dependence, intubation, and cardiac arrhythmias including cardiac arrest. He was able to recover from these complications, however, he ultimately chose to self-enroll in hospice care. An extensive literature review of over 128 mentions of FA-DLBCL noted a complete paucity of reported cases of FA-DLBCL within a native aorta. The patient's clinical presentation and histopathology without mass-forming lesions lead to the diagnosis of FA-DLBCL. FA-DLBCL is an extremely rare EBV+ lymphoproliferative disorder associated with chronic inflammation (DLBCL-CI). FA-DLBCL is a rare condition without defined uniform treatment. This article serves to highlight the first reported case of FA-DLBCL found within an abdominal aortic thrombus in a native aorta.

Activation of some signaling pathways can promote cell survival and have a negative impact on tumor response to radiotherapy. Here, the role of differences in expression levels of genes related to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in the survival or death of cells following X-ray exposure was investigated. Eight human cell cultures (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231: breast cancers; MCF-12A: apparently normal breast; A549: lung cancer; L132: normal lung; G28, G44 and G112: glial cancers) were irradiated with X-rays. The colony-forming and real-time PCR based on a custom human pathway RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Array assays were used to evaluate cell survival and gene expression, respectively. The surviving fractions at 2 Gy for the cell lines, in order of increasing radioresistance, were found to be as follows: MCF-7 (0.200 ± 0.011), G44 (0.277 ± 0.065), L132 (0.367 ± 0.023), MDA-MB-231 (0.391 ± 0.057), G112 (0.397 ± 0.113), A549 (0.490 ± 0.048), MCF-12A (0.526 ± 0.004), and G28 (0.633 ± 0.094). The rank order of radioresistance at 6 Gy was: MCF-7 &lt; L132 &lt; G44 &lt; MDA-MB-231 &lt; A549 &lt; G28 &lt; G112 &lt; MCF-12A. PCR array data analysis revealed that several genes were differentially expressed between irradiated and unirradiated cell cultures. The following genes, with fold changes: <i>BCL2A1</i> (21.91), <i>TP53</i> (8743.75), <i>RAD51</i> (11.66), <i>FOX1</i> (65.86), <i>TCP1</i> (141.32), <i>DNAJB1</i> (3283.64), <i>RAD51</i> (51.52), and <i>HSPE1</i> (12887.29) were highly overexpressed, and <i>BAX</i> (-127.21), <i>FOX1</i> (-81.79), <i>PDPK1</i> (-1241.78), <i>BRCA1</i> (-8.70), <i>MLH1</i> (-12143.95), <i>BCL2</i> (-18.69), <i>CCND1</i> (-46475.98), and <i>GJA1</i> (-2832.70) were highly underexpressed in the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MCF-12A, A549, L132, G28, G44, and G112 cell lines, respectively. The radioresistance in the malignant A549 and G28 cells was linked to upregulation in the apoptotic, DNA repair, PI3K, and Hsp90 pathway genes <i>BAG1</i>, <i>MGMT</i>, <i>FOXO1</i>, and <i>DNAJA1</i>, respectively, and inhibition of these genes resulted in significant radiosensitization. Targeting <i>BAG1</i>, <i>MGMT</i>, <i>FOXO1</i>, and <i>DNAJA1</i> with specific inhibitors might effectively sensitize radioresistant tumors to radiotherapy.	2022	05	31	Int J Radiat Biol	Manunu	Bayanika
35511691	10.1093/ajcp/aqac047	A Combined Biomarker of Bright CD38 and MYC ≥55% Is Highly Predictive of Double-/Triple-Hit High-Grade B-Cell Lymphoma.	Diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements (double-/triple-hit lymphoma [DTHL]) appears to mandate fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for all large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Given the low incidence of DTHL, we aimed to identify flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) features of DTHL that could be used to develop an optimal screening strategy. This combined FC-IHC approach has not yet been studied. We compared features of 40 cases of DTHL and 39 cases of diffuse LBCL (DLBCL) without MYC rearrangement. Bright CD38 expression (CD38bright) by FC, high MYC expression (≥55%), and double-expressor phenotype by IHC were significantly associated with DTHL. The biomarker combining FC and IHC, CD38bright and/or MYC ≥55%, was superior to FC and IHC markers alone in predicting DTHL. Restricting FISH testing to approximately 25% of LBCL based on CD38brightand/or MYC ≥55% would detect approximately 95% of DTHL-BCL2 and approximately 75% of DHL-BCL6. Our study demonstrated that the novel biomarker of CD38bright and/or MYC ≥55% is highly predictive of DTHL. Awareness of the advantages and limitations of this screening strategy would facilitate development of a rational diagnostic workflow to provide high-quality patient care.	2022	09	08	Am J Clin Pathol	Alsuwaidan	Abdullah
35513284	10.1016/j.mce.2022.111653	Exosomal miR-140-3p and miR-143-3p from TGF-β1-treated pancreatic stellate cells target BCL2 mRNA to increase β-cell apoptosis.	People with chronic pancreatitis (CP) normally develop a fibrotic pancreas with reduced β-cell mass. Limited studies have focused on the development and pathogenesis of CP-related diabetes. MiRNAs packaged as exosomes are the key regulators of β-cell dysfunction. This study aimed to define the effect of exosomal miRNA from activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) on β-cells. Exosomes in the supernatants of mouse PSCs lines were extracted via ultracentrifugation and then identified. The role of exosomes secreted by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-treated PSCs in β-cell function was assessed. MiRNAs were prepared from exosomes extracted from TGF-β1-treated and untreated PSCs (T-Exo or C-Exo), and the miRNA expression profiles were compared by microarray. Then, miR-140-3p and miR-143-3p were overexpressed or inhibited in MIN6 cells and islets to determine their molecular and functional effects. Exosomes were the predominant extracellular vesicles secreted by PSCs into the culture medium. The MIN6 cells incubated with T-Exo had less insulin secretion and lower viability than the MIN6 cells incubated with PBS or C-Exo. MiR-140-3p and miR-143-3p were notably upregulated in T-Exo. Enhancing the expression of miR-140-3p and miR-143-3p in β-cells decreased the cell count and viability and increased the cleaved caspase-3 levels. Mechanistically, T-Exo mediated the intercellular transfer of miR-140-3p and miR-143-3p by targeting the B-cell lymphoma 2 gene in recipient β-cells to induce cell death. Exosomal miRNA transfer as a communication mode between PSCs and β-cells, which may be explored for its therapeutic utility.	2022	06	08	Mol Cell Endocrinol	Zhu	Xiangyun
35535226	10.1155/2022/1565094	Analysis of the Role and Mechanism of ZEB1 in Regulating Cervical Carcinoma Progression via Modulating PD-1/PD-L1 Checkpoint.	Cervical carcinoma (CC) is a common and highly malignant tumor in women. The involvement of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in many kinds of tumors has been well-documented; however, its role and mechanism in CC remain to be clarified. This study investigated the mechanism of ZEB1 in modulating the growth and metastasis of CC cells. The expression of ZEB1 in CC tissues and adjacent normal counterparts was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The correlation between ZEB1 and patient clinicopathological indexes was analyzed. In vitro, gain and loss functions of ZEB1 were performed in C-33A and HeLa cell lines. The proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and transwell assay, respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins such as BCL2-associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), and Caspase-3, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins including E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail, were measured by Western blotting. In addition, the targeting relationship between ZEB1 and programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was predicted by bioinformatics and further verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. ZEB1 was significantly up-regulated in CC tissues compared with normal counterparts. ZEB1 overexpression promoted the migration, proliferation, and invasion of CC cells and inhibited apoptosis, while knocking down ZEB1 contributed to the opposite effects. In addition, experiments on related mechanisms confirmed that ZEB1 targeted the 3'EUTR terminal of PD-1/PD-L1 and negatively regulated its expression. And an interaction between ZEB1 and PD-1/PD-L1 was identified. ZEB1 can promote the proliferation and metastasis of CC cells via modulating the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint.	2022	05	11	Comput Math Methods Med	Lin	Yuhong
35538643	10.1002/cam4.4742	Clinical presentation, outcome, and prognostic markers in patients with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, a lymphoma study association (LYSA) retrospective study.	Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (lVLBCL) is a very rare type of large B-cell lymphoma. We conducted a retrospective study on IVLBCL patients treated from 2000 to 2016 in LYSA cooperative group centers. Sixty-five patients were identified in 23 centers. Median age at diagnosis was 69 years (range 23-92). Thirty-four patients (64%) had an IPI score &gt;3 and 40 patients (67%) had a performance status ≥2. The most frequent extra-nodal locations were bone marrow (n = 34; 52%), central nervous system (n = 25; 39%), and skin (n = 21; 33%). Nodal involvement and endocrine system were observed in 34% (n = 22) and 18% (n = 12) of all cases, respectively. Twenty-six patients (41%) had macrophage activation syndrome. Tumor cells were frequently CD5 positive (52%) with a non-germinal center origin (86%). BCL2 was expressed in 87% of all samples analyzed (n = 20) and 43% of patients had a MYC/BCL2 double expression. Fifty-six patients were treated with a regimen of chemotherapy containing rituximab, among whom 73% reached complete remission. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 29.4 months and 63.8 months, respectively. History of autoimmune disorder (Hazard ratio [HR] 3.3 [1.4-7.8]; p &lt; 0.01), nodal involvement (HR 2.6 [1.4-5.1]; p &lt; 0.01), lack of anthracycline (HR 0.1 [0-0.4] for use; p &lt; 0.001), or no intensification at first-line regimen (p = 0.02) were associated with worse PFS. High-dose methotrexate use was not associated with better PFS or OS. Our study highlights the aggressive clinical picture of IVLBCL, in particular the frequency of macrophage activation syndrome, and the need for new therapies despite a response to R-CHOP-like regimen similar to non-intravascular diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	2022	05	19	Cancer Med	Bonnet	Antoine
35539018	10.1016/j.lrr.2022.100318	A very rare case of extranodal B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with adrenal and heart involvement.	We report an extremely rare case of extranodal B-cell NHL: DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma), stage IVE, presenting with heart and bilateral adrenal involvement. On admission, adrenal and thorax imaging identified large bilateral adrenal masses and a 4.6 cm mass in the right atrium wall. An adrenal biopsy revealed the presence of a DLBCL, with triple expression of bcl2, bcl6, C-MYC(+70%). Following six cycles of systemic immunochemotherapy with R-DA-EPOCH, and high methotrexate dose for CNS prophylaxis a marked decrease of lymphoma infiltration was observed. The selection of the appropriate treatment modality can lead to profound response and improve patient's outcome.	2022	07	16	Leuk Res Rep	Papanastasiou	Labrini
35549669	10.1164/rccm.202201-0033OC	Tacrolimus Prevents Mechanical and Humoral Alterations in Brain Death-induced Lung Injury in Pigs.	<b>Rationale:</b> Donor brain death-induced lung injury may compromise graft function after transplantation. Establishing strategies to attenuate lung damage remains a challenge because the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. <b>Objectives:</b> The effects of tacrolimus pretreatment were evaluated in an experimental model of brain death-induced lung injury. <b>Methods:</b> Brain death was induced by slow intracranial infusion of blood in anesthetized pigs after randomization to tacrolimus (orally administered at 0.25 mg ⋅ kg<sup>-1</sup> twice daily the day before the experiment and intravenously at 0.05 mg ⋅ kg<sup>-1</sup> 1 h before the experiment; <i>n</i> = 8) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 9) pretreatment. Hemodynamic measurements were performed 1, 3, 5, and 7 hours after brain death. After euthanasia of the animals, lung tissue was sampled for pathobiological and histological analysis, including lung injury score (LIS). <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Tacrolimus pretreatment prevented increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary pressure and decreases in systemic arterial pressure and thermodilution cardiac output associated with brain death. After brain death, the ratio of Pa<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> to Fi<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased, which was prevented by tacrolimus. Tacrolimus pretreatment prevented increases in the ratio of IL-6 to IL-10, <i>VCAM1</i> (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), circulating concentrations of IL-1β, and glycocalyx-derived molecules. Tacrolimus partially decreased apoptosis (<i>Bax</i> [<i>Bcl2</i>-associated X apoptosis regulator]-to-<i>Bcl2</i> [B-cell lymphoma-2] ratio [<i>P</i> = 0.07] and number of apoptotic cells in the lungs [<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05]) but failed to improve LIS. <b>Conclusions:</b> Immunomodulation through tacrolimus pretreatment prevented pulmonary capillary hypertension as well as the activation of inflammatory and apoptotic processes in the lungs after brain death; however, LIS did not improve.	2022	09	08	Am J Respir Crit Care Med	Belhaj	Asmae
35566180	10.3390/molecules27092827	Dioscin-Mediated Autophagy Alleviates MPP<sup>+</sup>-Induced Neuronal Degeneration: An In Vitro Parkinson's Disease Model.	Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process by which cells degrade and recycle their malfunctioned contents, and impairment in this process could lead to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, has induced autophagy in several cell lines and animal models. The role of dioscin-mediated autophagy in PD remains to be investigated. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the hypothesis that dioscin-regulated autophagy and autophagy-related (ATG) proteins could protect neuronal cells in PD via reducing apoptosis and enhancing neurogenesis. In this study, the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>) was used to induce neurotoxicity and impair autophagic flux in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The result showed that dioscin pre-treatment counters MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated autophagic flux impairment and alleviates MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced apoptosis by downregulating activated caspase-3 and BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax) expression while increasing B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression. In addition, dioscin pre-treatment was found to increase neurotrophic factors and tyrosine hydroxylase expression, suggesting that dioscin could ameliorate MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced degeneration in dopaminergic neurons and benefit the PD model. To conclude, we showed dioscin's neuroprotective activity in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells might be partly related to its autophagy induction and suppression of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.	2022	05	19	Molecules	Azam	Shofiul
35568724	10.1038/s41394-022-00520-y	Primary intradural extramedullary spinal Burkitt's lymphoma mimicking a nerve sheath tumor: a case report.	Spinal involvement in lymphomas is often associated with advanced disease. Primary spinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a rare entity. A 47-year-old male presented with a history of neck pain followed by progressive quadriparesis and bowel bladder involvement over a 5-month period. The magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of an intradural extramedullary lesion at the C1-C2 vertebra level. A surgical excision was done and the histopathology revealed atypical lymphoid cells, which are immunopositive for CD45, CD20, MUM-1, and BCL6, while negative for BCL2, EBV (LMP-1 and CISH), Cyclin D1 and confirmed the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient received chemotherapy in the form of CODOX-M/IVAC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate/ifosfamide, etoposide, high-dose cytarabine) regimen. Primary spinal intradural extramedullary Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare diagnosis that may often be difficult to differentiate radiologically from other causes of intradural extramedullary lesions. A thorough histological examination is warranted in such cases.	2022	05	19	Spinal Cord Ser Cases	Bansal	Tungish

35571440	10.21037/atm-22-894	Long non-coding RNA MEG3 regulates the progress of osteoarthritis by regulating the miR-34a/Klotho axis.	Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic diseases today, and its prevalence and incidence are expected to increase as life expectancy increases. By investigating the inhibition of long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA MEG3) in OA, we hope to provide some new insights into the treatment of osteoarthritis. By constructing an osteoarthritis model, the knee joint tissue of the model was observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and computed tomography (CT). Detection of miR-34a and Klotho expression by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. The lncRNA MEG3 overexpression vector was constructed and transfected into C28/I2 cells. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the results of lncRNA MEG3 and miR-34a expression in each group of cells, and Western blot was used to detect the results of Klotho, recombinant fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-associated X (Bax), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (Caspase3) and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 8 (Caspase8) protein expression. Compared with the control group, HE and CT results showed significant pathological changes in the knee joint of the osteoarthritis model mice. and Klotho expression was significantly decreased and miR-34a expression was significantly increased in the model group (P&lt;0.05). Compared with those in the control group, the expression levels of lncRNA MEG3, Klotho, FGF23, and Bcl-2 decreased significantly and the expression levels of microRNA-34a (miR-34a), Bax, TGF-β1, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8 increased sharply (P&lt;0.05) in the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) group. Meanwhile, lncRNA MEG3 overexpression upregulated the expression of miR-34a, Bax, TGF-β1, Caspase3 and Caspase8, and downregulated the expression of Klotho, FGF23 and Bcl-2. lncRNA MEG3 regulated the expression of FGF23, Bcl-2, Bax, TGF-β1, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8 by regulating the miR-34a/Klotho axis, thereby affecting the progress of OA.	2022	08	30	Ann Transl Med	Xiong	Gaoxin
35576104	10.1111/1440-1681.13667	Glaucocalyxin A induces apoptosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway.	Lung cancer is one of the fastest growing malignancies in morbidity and mortality, and current therapies are in general not sufficiently effective for this deadly disease. This study characterizes the anticancer effects of glaucocalyxin A (GLA) and explores the underlying mechanisms using human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. First, our data showed that GLA suppressed the viability of cancer cells, whereas no effect was observed in the normal bronchial epithelial cell BEAS-2B cells. Second, GLA inhibited colony formation, induced apoptosis of cancer cells. Third, GLA downregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein; upregulated the expression of Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), and strengthened cleavage of caspase 3 and polyadenyl diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP). Fourth, GLA also diminished mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) pathway. In addition, injection of GLA (20 mg/kg) every 2 days significantly inhibited A549 xenograft tumour growth, accompanied by increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Together, our study provides evidence that the anticancer effect of GLA in NSCLC is mediated by inducing apoptosis through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway and suggests that GLA may be used as a promising natural medicine for NSCLC therapy.	2022	07	12	Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol	Zhang	De
35576884	10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2022.111855	Cyclometalated iridium(III) dithioformic acid complexes as mitochondria-targeted imaging and anticancer agents.	Four neutral cyclometalated iridium(III) (Ir<sup>III</sup>) dithioformic acid complexes ([(ppy)<sub>2</sub>Ir(S^S)], Ir1-Ir4) were designed and synthesized. Toxicity assay revealed that these complexes showed favorable anticancer activity, especially for human non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549). Ir1 exhibited the best anticancer activity (11.0 ± 0.4 μM) was about twice that of cisplatin, meanwhile, which could availably restrain A549 cells migration. Complexes could target mitochondria, induce a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), result in an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disruption of the cell cycle, and ultimately generate apoptosis. Western blotting experiment indicated that complexes could inhibit the expression of B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2), induce the expression of BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) and lead to a massive release of Cytochrome C (Cyt-c), which amplified apoptosis signals by activating downstream pathway to promote apoptosis. All these confirmed the existence of mitochondrial anticancer channels for these complexes. Above all, cyclometalated iridium(III) dithioformic acid complexes possess the prospect of becoming a multifunctional cancer therapeutic platform, including mitochondria-targeted imaging, anti-migration, and anticancer agents.	2022	06	08	J Inorg Biochem	Wu	Yuting
35577753	10.1016/j.clml.2022.04.017	SOHO State of the Art Updates and Next Questions | Management of Most Difficult Cases of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Relapse After Both BTK and BCL2 Inhibition and Richter Transformation.	The introduction of targeted therapies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has ushered in a new era in which patients achieve better control of their disease, survive longer, and experience fewer toxicities than before. Despite this progress, a subgroup of patients with CLL will develop resistance to both Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors. In addition, a subgroup of CLL cases will transform into aggressive lymphoma - called Richter transformation - either before or during targeted therapy. These two subgroups of patients have a poor prognosis, and available therapies lead to long-term remission in only a minority of patients. In this paper, two cases are presented that are reflective of these difficult scenarios. In the first case, a patient with CLL, complex karyotype, del 17p, and a mutation in TP53 experiences progression after ibrutinib, venetoclax, bendamustine, rituximab, and idelalisib. In the second case, a patient with CLL and del 17p develops a Richter transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after treatment with obinutuzumab, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, venetoclax, and idelalisib. The aggressive lymphoma is refractory to chemoimmunotherapy, and she expires. The literature pertaining to these two scenarios is reviewed, including the role of available targeted therapies, chemoimmunotherapy, and hematopoietic cell transplantation. Emerging novel therapies, including reversible BTK inhibitors and CAR T cell therapy, are discussed.	2022	06	21	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Burke	John M
35578798	10.1002/jcp.30777	Neddylation inactivation affects cell cycle and apoptosis in sheep follicular granulosa cells.	Protein neddylation inactivation is a novel topic in cancer research. However, there are few studies on the mechanism of neddylation underlying the development of sheep follicular granulosa cells (GCs). In this study, the development of follicular GCs in sheep was inactivated by MLN4924, a neddylation-specific inhibitor, which significantly attenuated the proliferation and cell index of sheep follicular GCs. Further, the inactivation of neddylation by MLN4924 caused the accumulation of the cullin ring ligase (CRLs) substrates Wee1 and c-Myc, which could upregulate NOXA protein expression. Meanwhile, the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL2) family members Bcl-2 and MCL-1 were downregulated, subsequently inducing apoptosis in follicular GCs of sheep. Increasing Wee1 levels caused G2/M-phase arrest. The effects of neddylation inactivation on Akt, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, and Forkhead box class O(FOXO) family members were evaluated. Neddylation inactivation by MLN4924 increased the levels of phospho-Akt, JAK2, phospho-STAT3, and FOXO1 (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased the levels of phospho-FOXO3a and STAT3 (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, MLN4924 could alter the mitochondrial morphology of GCs, increase cellular glucose utilization and lactate production, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and promote sheep follicular GCs glycolysis, thus causing changes in mitochondrial functions. Together, these findings point to an unrecognized role of neddylation in regulating follicular GCs proliferation in sheep.	2022	08	16	J Cell Physiol	Qin	Xiaowei
35583405	10.1097/DAD.0000000000002053	Histological Transformation and Clonal Relationship of Subcutaneous Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Histological transformation (HT) is an exceptionally uncommon and poorly understood event where a low-grade or indolent B-cell lymphoma transforms into a more aggressive entity, typically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The pathogenesis is unclear; however, HT is associated with a worse prognosis. This article reports a unique case of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) limited to skin/subcutis (confirmed with PET-CT) that subsequently developed DLBCL, followed by nodal MZL. We explored phenotypic, molecular genetic, and cytogenetic findings in subcutaneous MZL with HT to DLBCL and subsequent progression to systemic MZL. Shared clonal peaks between the tumors were demonstrated through immunoglobulin heavy chain PCR, and genomic microarray analysis revealed both unique genomic abnormalities and shared regions of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity in all specimens. BCL-2 expression was present in the original subcutaneous MZL, lost on conversion to Primary cutaneous diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PCDLBCL)-NOS, and regained during subsequent transformation to systemic MZL. The PCDLBCL-NOS did not demonstrate FISH rearrangements for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6. Here, we describe the histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic abnormalities of the clonally related transformation of subcutaneous MZL, PCDLBCL-NOS, and eventual systemic MZL. The predominantly subcutaneous presentation of MZL may be associated with a more aggressive outcome and raises consideration for careful evaluation of patients who present with this pattern.	2022	05	20	Am J Dermatopathol	Abbott	James

Despite promising activity in hematopoietic malignancies, efficacy of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax in solid tumors is unknown. We report the prespecified VERONICA primary results, a randomized phase II clinical trial evaluating venetoclax and fulvestrant in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, post-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor progression. Pre-/postmenopausal females ≥18 years were randomized 1:1 to venetoclax (800 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular; cycle 1: days 1 and 15; subsequent 28-day cycles: day 1) or fulvestrant alone. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety. Exploratory biomarker analyses included BCL2 and BCL extra-large (BCLXL) tumor expression, and PIK3CA circulating tumor DNA mutational status. At primary analysis (cutoff: August 5, 2020; n = 103), venetoclax did not significantly improve CBR [venetoclax plus fulvestrant: 11.8% (n = 6/51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.44-23.87); fulvestrant: 13.7% (7/51; 5.70-26.26); risk difference -1.96% (95% CI, -16.86 to 12.94)]. Median PFS was 2.69 months (95% CI, 1.94-3.71) with venetoclax plus fulvestrant versus 1.94 months (1.84-3.55) with fulvestrant (stratified HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61-1.45; P = 0.7853). Overall survival data were not mature. A nonsignificant improvement of CBR and PFS was observed in patients whose tumors had strong BCL2 expression (IHC 3+), a BCL2/BCLXL Histoscore ratio ≥1, or PIK3CA-wild-type status. Our findings do not indicate clinical utility for venetoclax plus fulvestrant in endocrine therapy-resistant, CDK4/6 inhibitor-refractory metastatic breast tumors, but suggest possible increased dependence on BCLXL in this setting.	2022	08	04	Clin Cancer Res	Lindeman	Geoffrey J
35583809	10.1002/ptr.7481	Psoralidin protects against cerebral hypoxia/reoxygenation injury: Role of GAS6/Axl signaling.	Psoralidin (PSO) is a natural phenolic coumarin extracted from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia L. Growing preclinical evidence indicates that PSO has anti-inflammatory, anti-vitiligo, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral effects. Growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6) and its receptor, Axl, modulate cellular oxidative stress, apoptosis, survival, proliferation, migration, and mitogenesis. Notably, the neuroprotective role of the GAS6/Axl axis has been identified in previous studies. We hypothesize that PSO ameliorates cerebral hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) injury via activating the GAS6/Axl signaling. We first confirmed that PSO was not toxic to the cells and upregulated GAS6 and Axl expression after HR injury. Moreover, PSO exerted a marked neuroprotective effect against HR injury, represented by restored cell viability and cell morphology, decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, PSO pretreatment also elevated the levels of nuclear factor-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCl2) both in the condition of baseline and HR injury. However, GAS6 siRNA or Axl siRNA inhibited the neuroprotective effects of PSO. Our findings suggest that PSO pretreatment attenuated HR-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neuroblastoma cells through the activation of GAS6/Axl signaling.	2022	06	21	Phytother Res	Lei	Wangrui
35584731	10.1016/j.tiv.2022.105386	Paclitaxel is evidence to reduce growing ovarian follicle growth in mice model study.	We aimed to investigate the effects of paclitaxel on ovarian follicle development and oocyte meiotic competence. Early secondary follicles were cultured individually with or without paclitaxel 2.5 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, 2.5 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, and 2.5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M for 12 days. Thereafter, the follicles were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Follicle morphology, oocytes meiotic maturation, immunofluorescence for α-tubulin of the oocytes, mRNA expression of growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and Bcl2-associated X (Bax) were examined every 4, 8, and 12 days of the culture period. We demonstrated that high dose paclitaxel treatment decreased follicle survival (p ≤ 0.05), while lower dose (2.5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M) reduced the survival compared to control after 12 days of culture. The number of oocytes at MII stage was not significantly different between control and paclitaxel groups (p &gt; 0.05). Paclitaxel increased GDF9 expression in oocytes after 4 days of the culture (p ≤ 0.05). Bcl2 declined significantly compared to control after 8 days (p ≤ 0.05 for all groups), while Bax expression tended to be consistent (p ≥ 0.05 for all groups). To conclude, high concentration paclitaxel reduces follicle preantral follicle growth, while in lower concentration it decreases more growing follicle growth and survival.	2022	07	19	Toxicol In Vitro	Maidarti	Mila
35592654	10.1155/2022/5707504	Effect of miR-144-3p-Targeted Regulation of PTEN on Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells under Stretch.	To investigate the effects of miR-144-3p-targeted regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene on proliferation, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) under retraction force. The BMSCs of rats were randomly divided into the tension MSC group with detrusor stimulation and the MSC group without detrusor stimulation, after which osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was induced in both groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining were used to detect the osteogenic differentiation ability of the two groups of cells. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-144-3p and PTEN in the two groups of cells after osteogenic differentiation. Bioinformatics website and dual luciferase reporter were used to detect the relationship between miR-144-3p and PTEN. The tension MSC group was used as a control group, and miR-144-3p mimics (miR-144-3p mimic group), mimic controls (mimic-NC group), PTEN interferers (si-PTEN group), and interference controls (si-NC group) were transfected into BMSCs. The BMSCs were then continuously stimulated for 24 h using a Flexercell in vitro cellular mechanics loading device, applying a draft force at a frequency of 1 Hz and a deformation rate of 18%. The cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay; the expression levels of cyclin, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), BCL2-associated X (BAX), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), and other cell cycle and apoptosis related proteins were detected by western blot (WB); and the osteogenic differentiation ability of MSC cells was detected by ALP staining and alizarin red staining. Compared with the MSC group, the level of miR-144-3p was significantly lower and the level of PTEN was significantly higher in the tension MSC group. ALP staining showed normal activity in the MSC group and decreased ALP activity in the tension MSC group compared to the MSC group. Alizarin red staining in the MSC group showed scattered calcium nodule formation, and alizarin red staining showed red nodules with a more uniform color distribution. Compared to the MSC group, the tension MSC group showed fewer, smaller, and lighter staining mineralized nodules. Compared with the tension group and mimic-NC group (si-NC group), the proliferation rate of cells in the miR-144-3p mimic group (si-PTEN group) was significantly higher; the expression levels of PTEN and BAX were significantly lower; and the expression levels of cyclin, CDK, and BCL-2 protein were significantly higher. ALP staining results revealed that the miR-144-3p mimic group (si-PTEN group) showed significantly higher osteogenic differentiation ability and ALP activity of MSC than the tension group and mimic-NC group (si-NC group). miR-144-3p may inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs under tension by targeting and regulating PTEN.	2022	07	16	Emerg Med Int	Ling	Shiyong
35595618	10.1016/j.clml.2022.04.010	Baseline Total Metabolic Tumor Volume is Prognostic for Refractoriness to Immunochemotherapy in DLBCL: Results From GOYA.	A good response to initial therapy is key to maximizing survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but patients with chemorefractory disease and early progression have poor outcomes. Data from the GOYA study in patients with DLBCL who received first-line rituximab or obinutuzumab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) were analyzed. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-derived characteristics associated with total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and clinical risk factors for primary chemorefractory disease and disease progression within 12 months (POD12) were explored. Of those patients fulfilling the criteria for analysis, 108/1126 (10%) were primary chemorefractory and 147/1106 (13%) had POD12. Primary chemorefractory and POD12 status were strongly associated with reduced overall survival. After multivariable analysis of clinical and imaging-based risk factors by backward elimination, only very high TMTV (quartile [Q] 1 vs. Q4 odds ratio [OR]: 0.45; P = .006) and serum albumin levels (low vs. normal OR of 1.86; P = .004) were associated with primary chemorefractoriness. After additionally accounting for BCL2/MYC translocation in a subset of patients, TMTV and BCL2/MYC double-hit status remained as significant predictors of primary chemorefractoriness (Q1 vs. Q4 OR: 0.32, P = .01 and double-hit vs. no-hit OR of 4.47, P = .02, respectively). Risk factors including very high TMTV, high sum of the product of the longest diameters (SPD), geographic region (Asia), short time since diagnosis, extranodal involvement and low serum albumin were retained for POD12. PET-derived TMTV has prognostic value in identifying patients at risk of early treatment failure.	2022	07	19	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Ruiz	Irene Canales
35601256	10.1016/j.aninu.2022.03.003	Effects of fish meal replacement with <i>Chlorella</i> meal on growth performance, pigmentation, and liver health of largemouth bass (<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>).	<i>Chlorella</i> meal is a potential protein source for aquafeeds. However, the physiological response of carnivorous fish fed <i>Chlorella</i> meal remains elusive. This study evaluated the effects of replacing dietary fish meal with <i>Chlorella</i> meal on growth performance, pigmentation, and liver health in largemouth bass. Five diets were formulated to replace dietary fish meal of 0% (C0, control), 25% (C25), 50% (C50), 75% (C75), and 100% (C100) with <i>Chlorella</i> meal, respectively. Total 300 fish (17.6 ± 0.03 g) were randomly assigned to 15 tanks (3 tanks/group). Fish were fed the experimental diet twice daily for 8 weeks. The increased dietary <i>Chlorella</i> meal quadratically influenced the final body weight (FBW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and feed intake (FI), which were significantly lower in the C100 group than in the other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) increased linearly or quadratically with dietary <i>Chlorella</i> meal. Dietary <i>Chlorella</i> meal linearly or quadratically increased the lutein content of plasma, liver, and dorsal muscle of largemouth bass (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Compared to the C0 group, all supplemented <i>Chlorella</i> meal groups significantly improved the yellowness (b∗) of the dorsal body (1.5 to 2.0 fold), abdominal body (1.5 to 1.8 fold), and dorsal muscle (3.8 to 5.4 fold) of largemouth bass (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, compared to the C0 group, the liver vacuolation area of fish was significantly increased in the C75 and C100 groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Transcriptional levels of apoptosis-related genes of β-cell lymphoma-2 (<i>bcl2</i>)<i>,</i> caspase-9-like (<i>casp9</i>)<i>,</i> and caspase-3a (<i>casp3</i>) were markedly upregulated (0.9 to 1.6 fold) in the C100 group compared to the C0 group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Based on the quadratic regression analysis between FBW, WGR, or SGR and dietary <i>Chlorella</i> meal level, largemouth bass had the best growth when replacing 31.7% to 32.6% of fish meal with 15.03% to 15.43% dietary <i>Chlorella</i> meal. The present results indicated that dietary supplementation with <i>Chlorella</i> meal (11.85% to 47.45%) significantly enhanced the pigmentation; however, total replacement of fish meal (40%) with <i>Chlorella</i> meal (47.45%) caused growth retardation, apoptosis, and liver damage in largemouth bass.	2022	07	16	Anim Nutr	Xi	Longwei
35603649		[Activation of JNK induces apoptosis to autophagy conversion and enhances the survival of oxygen-glycogen deprived rat neurons].	Objective To investigate the efficacy and mechanism of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in boosting survival of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) rat neurons. Methods The cortex neurons from fetal rats were primarily cultured to prepare a model of OGD neurons in vitro, and the characteristic endpoints were filtered to intervene with JNK inducer anisomycin (AN), respectively. The cells were randomly divided into control group, solvent control group (a same volume of solvent DMSO was added into the culture medium of the OGD neuron), AN group (OGD neurons were treated with JNK inducer AN for 5 hours at the end of OGD). After that, Western blotting and immunofluorescence cytometry were respectively performed to detect the protein expressions in OGD neurons, including beclin 1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), caspase-3, P62, ubiquitin, cathepsin B and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). The cell activity was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, and the axon length was measured by IPP software. Results Activation of JNK significantly promoted the expressions of beclin 1, LC3, and Bcl2, and markedly reduced the content of beclin 1-Bcl2 complex and attenuated the expressions of P62 and ubiquitin. Meanwhile, the expressions of cathepsin B and LAMP1 were not obviously altered. In this way, the survival rate of OGD neurons was improved. Conclusion Activation of JNK exerts a neuroprotective effect by facilitating dissociation of beclin 1-Bcl2 and inducing a switch from apoptosis to autophagy in OGD neurons.	2022	05	24	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Huang	Zhiwen
35603962	10.1002/mgg3.1964	Construction of three-gene-based prognostic signature and analysis of immune cells infiltration in children and young adults with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Although B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients' survival has been improved dramatically, some cases still relapse. This study aimed to explore the prognosis-related novel differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for predicting the overall survival (OS) of children and young adults (CAYAs) with B-ALL and analyze the immune-related factors contributing to poor prognosis. GSE48558 and GSE79533 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and clinical sample information and mRNA-seq from Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database were retrieved. Prognosis-related key genes were enrolled to build a Cox proportional model using multivariate Cox regression. Five-year OS of patients, clinical characteristic relevance and clinical independence were assessed based on the model. The mRNA levels of prognosis-related genes were validated in our samples and the difference of immune cells composition between high-risk and low-risk patients were compared. One hundred and twelve DEGs between normal B cells and B-ALL cells were identified based on GSE datasets. They were mainly participated in protein binding and HIF-1 signaling pathway. One hundred and eighty-nine clinical samples were enrolled in the study, both Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis showed that CYBB, BCL2A1, IFI30, and EFNB1 were associated with prognosis, CYBB, BCL2A1, and EFNB1 were used to construct prognostic risk model. Moreover, compared to clinical indicators, the three-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor for CAYAs with B-ALL. Finally, the mRNA levels of CYBB, BCL2A1, and EFNB1 were significantly lower in B-ALL group as compared to controls. The high-risk group had a significantly higher percentage of infiltrated immune cells. We constructed a novel three-gene signature with independent prognostic factor for predicting 5-year OS of CAYAs with B-ALL. Additionally, we discovered the difference of immune cells composition between high-risk and low-risk groups. This study may help to customize individual treatment and improve prognosis of CAYAs with B-ALL.	2022	07	12	Mol Genet Genomic Med	Xiang	Chunli
35610180	10.1002/cbdv.202100845	Co-Binding of JQ1 and Venetoclax Exhibited Synergetic Inhibitory Effect for Cancer Therapy; Potential Line of Treatment for the Waldenström Macroglobulinemia Lymphoma.	In recent times, the development of combination therapy has been a focal point in drug discovery. This article explores the potential synergistic effect of co-administration of Bcl2 inhibitor Venetoclax and BET inhibitor JQ1. We envisioned that the 'dual-site'-binding of Bcl2 has significant prospects and paves the way for the next round of rational design of potent Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) therapy. The preferential binding mechanisms of the multi-catalytic sites of the Bcl2 enzyme have been a subject of debate in the literature. This study conducted a systematic procedure to explore the preferred binding modes and the structural effects of co-binding at each catalytic active site. Interestingly, a mutual enhanced binding effect was observed - Venetoclax increased the binding affinity of JQ1 by 11.5 %, while JQ1 boosted the binding affinity of Venetoclax by 16.3 % when compared with individual inhibition of each drug. This synergistic binding effect has significantly increased protein stability, with substantial correlated movements and multiple van der Waals interactions. The structural and thermodynamic insights unveiled in this report would assist the future design of improved combined therapy against WM.	2022	07	27	Chem Biodivers	Elamin	Ghazi
35616841	10.1007/s11356-022-20734-9	Cadmium induces apoptosis by miR-9-5p targeting PTEN and regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway in the piglet adrenal gland.	Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental pollutant that can cause endocrine organ damage. To explore the effect of subacute CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure on piglet adrenal gland tissue and its mechanism based on the establishment of this model, bioinformatics, TUNEL assay, western blot (WB), and qRT-PCR methods were used to detect related indicators. The results showed that after Cd exposure, antioxidant enzymes decreased, heat shock protein increased, and miR-9-5p-gene of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) upregulates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathway. After this pathway was activated, the expression of the apoptosis-related factors cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase 3 and 9 (caspase 3 and 9), B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X (BAX) was increased sharply, and the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) was significantly decreased. The changes in these indicators indicate that Cd exposure induces apoptosis and causes tissue damage in the adrenal gland of piglets. This study aims to reveal the toxic effects of CdCl<sub>2</sub> in animals and will provide new ideas for the toxicology of Cd.	2022	05	26	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Qi	Xue
35621073	10.1039/d1fo03746c	Nano-curcumin supplementation in critically ill patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial investigating the inflammatory biomarkers, oxidative stress indices, endothelial function, clinical outcomes and nutritional status.	Sepsis is a severe reaction and excessive immune response to infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction, and death. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of nano-curcumin (NC) on inflammatory biomarkers, endothelial function, oxidative stress indices, biochemical factors, nutritional status, and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. In the present double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 40 ICU-admitted patients were randomly allocated into either NC or placebo group for 10 days. Both nano-curcumin (160 mg) and placebo were administered <i>via</i> a nasogastric tube twice a day. The mRNA expression of nuclear-related factor 2 (<i>Nrf-2</i>), BCL2 associated X (<i>BAX</i>), B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>BCL-2</i>), and toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR-4</i>) genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and the serum levels of primary, secondary, tertiary, and exploratory outcomes were assessed before the baseline and on days 5 and 10. There were significant improvements in the primary outcomes, including inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, IL-10, TLR-4, BCL-2 and BAX), markers of endothelial function (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and oxidative stress indices (malondialdehyde (MDA), nuclear-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and TAC) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005) in the NC group compared to the placebo group after 10 days, while no significant increase was observed in the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) level between the two groups. However, no significant decrease was observed in the levels of secondary outcomes, including biochemical factors (creatinine, fasting blood sugar (FBS), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC)) (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Our results showed that in the tertiary outcome (nutritional status), there was no significant increase (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) except for TLC (<i>P</i> = 0.003). NC supplementation also resulted in a significant decrease in the exploratory outcomes including the SOFA score and the duration of mechanical ventilation (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Supplementation with NC may be a promising treatment strategy for critically ill patients with sepsis. However, further experiments are suggested to investigate the effects of nano-curcumin on biochemical pathways involved in sepsis.	2022	06	21	Food Funct	Karimi	Arash
35622324	10.1007/978-1-0716-2115-8_8	Targeted Locus Amplification as Marker Screening Approach to Detect Immunoglobulin (IG) Translocations in B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas.	Although MRD monitoring by the classic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach is a powerful outcome predictor, about 20% of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 50% of follicular lymphoma (FL) patients still lack a molecular marker and are thus resulting not eligible for MRD monitoring. Targeted locus amplification (TLA), a new NGS technology, has been revealed as a feasible marker screening approach able to identify uncommon B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (BCL1) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) rearrangements in MCL and FL cases defined as having ""no marker"" by the classic PCR approach.	2022	05	31	Methods Mol Biol	Genuardi	Elisa
35624736	10.3390/antiox11050872	Dietary Tryptophan Supplementation Improves Antioxidant Status and Alleviates Inflammation, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Apoptosis, and Pyroptosis in the Intestine of Piglets after Lipopolysaccharide Challenge.	Tryptophan can alleviate stress and improve intestinal health, but the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to examine the effects of tryptophan supplementation on antioxidant status, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis signaling pathway in the intestine of piglets after <i>Escherichia coli</i> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Thirty-two weaning piglets were allotted to four treatments including: non-challenged control, LPS-challenged control, LPS + 0.2% tryptophan and LPS + 0.4% tryptophan. On day 35 of feeding, piglets were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg/kg of body weight LPS or saline. Among the LPS-challenged pigs, tryptophan supplementation improved intestinal morphology as indicated by greater villus height, villus area and smaller crypt depth, and antioxidant status, and decreased the mRNA expression and concentration of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, tryptophan downregulated the expression of ER stress (ER oxidoreductase-1α, ER oxidoreductase-1β, glucose-regulated protein-78, activating transcription factor 6, C/EBP homologous protein), apoptosis (B-cell lymphoma-2, BCL2-associated X protein, caspase 3), and pyroptosis signaling pathway (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3, caspase 1, gasdermin-D, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). Collectively, tryptophan supplementation can contribute to gut health by improving antioxidant status and alleviating inflammation, ER stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis in the intestine of piglets after lipopolysaccharide challenge.	2022	07	16	Antioxidants (Basel)	Liu	Guangmang
35625017	10.3390/brainsci12050631	Preconditioned MSCs Alleviate Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rats by Improving the Neurological Function and the Inhibition of Apoptosis.	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great application prospects in the treatment of ischemic injury. However, their long-time cultivation before transplantation and poor survival after transplantation greatly limit the therapeutic effect and applications. This study aimed to investigate whether MSCs under the ischemic microenvironment could improve their survival and better alleviate cerebral ischemic injury. Firstly, we used ischemic brain tissue to culture MSCs and evaluated the functional changes of MSCs. Then a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced in rats, and the pretreated MSCs were injected via the tail vein. The adhesive removal test, rotarod test, modified neurological severity score, and pathological analyses were applied to assess the rats' neurological function. Then the expression of neuron and apoptosis related markers was detected. The results indicated that ischemic brain tissue pretreated MSCs promoted the proliferation and the release of the growth factors of MSCs. Meanwhile, in MCAO model rats, transplantation of pretreated MSCs enhanced the neurogenesis, attenuated behavioral changes, reduced infarct size, and inhibited apoptosis. The expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), NF-L, and NeuN were increased, while BCL2-Associated X (Bax) and Caspase-3 decreased. Our results suggest that MSCs pretreatment with stroke brain tissue could be an effective strategy in treating cerebral ischemic injury.	2022	07	16	Brain Sci	Zheng	Jin
35633553	10.31557/APJCP.2022.23.5.1679	Relationship between Bax and Bcl-2 Protein Expression and Outcome of Induction Phase Chemotherapy in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 causes apoptosis to stop and conversely the increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax makes lymphoblasts easy to destroy. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio plays a role in the balance of apoptosis, immortality, resistance, and outcome of chemotherapy. We analyzed the relationship between the Bax/BCl-2 ratio and the outcome of induction phase chemotherapy in pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). This research was conducted with a prospective observational study on pediatric ALL aged 1-18 years who were newly diagnosed based on bone marrow aspiration (morphology and immunophenotyping) at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya on October 2020 to March 2021. Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio was measured by the flow cytometry method from lymphoblast on bone marrow aspirate samples before and after induction phase chemotherapy according to the 2018 Childhood ALL Indonesian Protocol. The outcomes evaluated were survival and remission rate (lymphoblasts in the bone marrow less than 5%). We used the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test to analyze the differences between protein expression with p&lt;0.05 for a two-tailed test. We included 17/26 pediatric ALL, consisting of 88% male, 94% LLA-L1, 76% B cell ALL and 24% T cell ALL. Mean expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio before chemotherapy among pediatric ALL who alive (N=11) and dead (N=6) were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05). All children who completed the induction phase of chemotherapy went into remission. Bax and Bcl-2 expression before and after chemotherapy showed no difference (p&gt;0.05). The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased from 1.74(SD 1.846) to 6.17(4.139) with p=0.021. Expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio at the beginning of diagnosis did not affect the survival of pediatric ALL after the induction phase of chemotherapy. The Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio increased 3.5 times in pediatric ALL with remission outcomes, indicating proapoptotic dominance.	2022	05	31	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Cahyadi	Andi
35635742	10.1177/10781552221103820	Long-term follow-up and future direction on the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma remain the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries. Novel therapeutics have established long-term efficacy and have changed the landscape in patient management. In contrast, novel approaches pose opportunities for patients to be treated for finite durations. In this manuscript, we highlight long-term safety and efficacy data with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors and combination BCL2 + anti-CD20 therapies. We also offer key considerations for treatment selection and outline ongoing trials which may continue to expand therapeutic options and approaches. An electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma published using the following search terms: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, Richter syndrome, and histologic transformation. The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma are different manifestations of the same disease and are managed in much the same way. Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated long and durable efficacy benefits in patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and in the relapsed/refractory setting. Despite these benefits, long terms adverse events have posed challenges for patients and have led to treatment discontinuations. Additionally, the use of monotherapy Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor's requires chronic use of the medications leading to added financial implications. BCL2 inhibition with venetoclax in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has offered a novel and finite treatment approach in frontline and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Ongoing clinical trials are in investigating this modality further to enhance durable responses utilizing a combination Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor's and BCL2 inhibitors. The treatment armamentarium of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma continues to evolve. Despite the long term, durable responses with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor's, it is likely that finite treatment durations could become the standard of care as a result of continued, long-term responses.	2022	05	31	J Oncol Pharm Pract	Hanna	Kirollos S
35640776	10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120675	Selenium nanoparticles overcomes sorafenib resistance in thioacetamide induced hepatocellular carcinoma in rats by modulation of mTOR, NF-κB pathways and LncRNA-AF085935/GPC3 axis.	The first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (SOR). Sofafenib resistance is linked to protein kinase B/ mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, apoptosis inhibition and oxidative stress. This study investigated selenium nanoparticles (SeNps) to overcome SOR resistance in thioacetamide (TAA) induced HCC in rats. TAA (200 mg/kg/twice weekly, i.p.) was administered for 16 weeks to induce HCC.s. Rats were treated with oral SOR (10 mg/Kg daily), selenium, and SeNps (5 mg/kg three times/week) alone or in combination, for two weeks. Apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance were assessed. Cleaved caspase 3 (C. CASP3), mTOR, and NF-κB were determined by western blotting. Expression of p53 gene and long-noncoding RNA-AF085935 was determined by qRT-PCR. Expression of B- Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl associated X protein (Bax)and glypican 3 (GPC3) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver functions, antioxidant capacity, histopathology and CD34 immunohistochemistry were performed. SOR/SeNps reversed TAA-induced HCC in rats, through reduction of oxidative stress, activation of p53, Bax and CASP3, and inhibition of Bcl2. SOR/SeNps ameliorated the HCC-induced effect on cell proliferation and drug resistance by targeting mTOR and NF-κB pathways. SOR/SeNps decreased CD34 immunostaining indicating a decrease in angiogenesis and metastasis. SOR/SeNps regulated HCC epigenetically through the lncRNA-AF085935/GPC3 axis. SOR/SeNps are a promising combination for tumor suppression and overcoming sorafenib resistance in HCC by modulating apoptosis, AKT/mTOR and NF-κB pathways, as well as CD34 and lncRNA-AF085935/GPC3 axis.	2022	06	17	Life Sci	Al-Noshokaty	Tohada M
35646671	10.3389/fonc.2022.883141	Case Report: Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Clinicopathologic Study of Four Cases With Review of Additional 331 Cases in the Literature.	Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare and highly malignant non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma with uncommon clinical presentation and poor prognosis. The diagnostic pitfall of IVLBCL is mainly due to the fact that subtle histological changes could be easily overlooked, in addition to its rare occurrence, non-specific and variable clinical presentations, and the absence of significant mass lesions. The purpose of this study is to further explore the clinicopathologic and molecular features of IVLBCL to ensure an accurate diagnosis of this entity. Here, we retrospectively present the data of the four new cases and the literature cases. The age ranged from 23 to 92, with a medium age of 67 and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. The clinical manifestations are extremely variable, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, anemia, thrombocytopenia, unexplained hypoxemia, impaired consciousness, and skin lesions, as well as the extremely low levels of serum albumin, high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R), and ferritin. Morphologically, 99.9% of cases showed a selective growth pattern with large, atypical lymphocytes within the lumen of small blood vessels. In addition, vast majority of cases were positive for CD20, CD79a, PAX5, MUM1, and BCL6, and a subset of cases expressed BCL2 and CD5, whereas CD3 and CD10 were typically negative. Ki-67 proliferative index ranged from 20% to 100%. To sum up, we have conducted comprehensive case reports, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest reported cohort of IVLBCL cases. Comprehensive assessments and more IVLBCL cases are required for early diagnosis and prompt treatment.	2022	07	16	Front Oncol	Han	Yingying
35652622	10.4149/neo_2022_220318N300	High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements: Biopsy analysis of 70 cases from the Slovak Lymphoma Registry.	We performed a twelve-year retrospective analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients' biopsies with rearrangements of genes MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6, commonly referred to as double-hit and triple-hit high-grade B-cell lymphomas (DH/TH HGBL). Our aim was to present complex characteristics of the DH/TH HGBL group of patients diagnosed in the Slovak National Lymphoma Register together with the evaluation of the relationship between immunohistochemical (IHC) protein expressions of c-myc, bcl2, bcl6, and cyclin D1 in tissue specimens and the presence of rearrangements of their protein-coding genes by FISH analysis in order to find a clinically relevant diagnostic algorithm that would be the most time- and cost-efficient. For this study, a standard panel of histomorphological, IHC, and FISH methods was used to analyze the characteristics of 70 DH/TH HGBL patients' biopsies. Our study showed a predominance of the immunohistochemical GCB subtype over the non-GCB subtype (59:10 cases) in DH/TH lymphomas. The centroblastic morphology was the most commonly observed (30/70 cases; 43%). Furthermore, our study showed a high predominance of DH lymphoma cases with simultaneous MYC and BCL2 genes rearrangements (40/70; 57%), followed by an almost equal incidence of DH lymphomas with rearrangements of MYC and BCL6 genes (16/70; 23%) and of TH lymphomas (14/70; 20%). 15 of 16 FISH-examined DLBCL cases were negative for CCND1 rearrangement. A great majority of DH/TH cases showed also immunohistochemical overexpression of corresponding proteins (62/70; 89%), mostly in a form of triple expressor of c-myc/bcl2/bcl6 proteins (36/70; 51%), followed by c-myc/bcl2 and c-myc/bcl6 double expressor proteins positivity (20/70 and 6/70, respectively). Comparing preferential FISH testing of DE/TE and GCB DLBCL cases for genetic rearrangements we would be able to detect 89% and 84% of our HGBL-DH, TH group of patients, respectively. None of the examined methods for economically rational FISH testing showed enough concordance with IHC analysis results. We might, therefore, advocate the complex testing of all DLBCL patients' biopsies including FISH analyses.	2022	08	10	Neoplasma	Lešková	Katarína
35653936	10.1016/j.jtemb.2022.127014	Up-regulation of B-cell lymphoma factor-2 expression, inhibition of oxidative stress and down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in the protective effect of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) juice in lead-induced endothelial dysfunction in rats.	Oxido-inflammatory stress and dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) system has been implicated in lead toxicity. Cabbage is an antioxidant-rich household vegetable with plethora of therapeutic potentials. The present study investigated the anti-oxido-inflammatory activity of cabbage in lead-induced endothelial dysfunction. Twenty (20) male Wistar rats were selected into four groups (n = 5) and treated with distilled water (1 mL/100 g b.wt), lead acetate (25 mg/kg b.wt), cabbage juice (1 mL/100 g b.wt) and lead acetate (25 mg/kg b.wt) plus cabbage juice (1 mL/100 g b.wt) respectively. Treatment was done orally for 28 days, thereafter, oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, GSH, and MDA), inflammatory (TNF-α and IL-6) and apoptotic (Bcl-2) markers were assayed using standard biochemical assays as well as histoarchitectural study of the endothelium. The results showed that they were significant increase in MDA, ET-1, TNF-α and IL-6 while SOD, GSH, CAT, NO and Bcl-2 protein expression were decreased in Lead exposed animals. Endothelial histoarchitecture was also altered. Following Cabbage juice treatment, MDA, ET-I, TNF-α and IL-6 were down-regulated while SOD, GSH, CAT, NO and Bcl-2 protein expression were up-regulated. Histoarchitecture was significantly recovered. The study suggests that cabbage juice could mitigates Lead-induced endothelial dysfunction by modulating oxido-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mediators. All data are available upon request.	2022	08	08	J Trace Elem Med Biol	Asiwe	Jerome Ndudi
35657404	10.1007/s00428-022-03342-3	Plasmablastic myeloma in Taiwan frequently presents with extramedullary and extranodal mass mimicking plasmablastic lymphoma.	Plasmablastic myeloma (PBM) is a blastic morphologic variant of plasma cell myeloma with less favorable prognosis than those with non-blastic morphology. PBM is rare, without clear-cut definition and detailed clinicopathologic features in the literature. PBM may mimic plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) as they share nearly identical morphology and immunophenotype. Using the criteria of ≥ 30% plasmablasts in tissue sections, we retrospectively recruited PBM cases and analyzed their clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings, with emphasis on extramedullary involvement. We performed immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBER), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for lymphoma- and myeloma-associated genetic alterations. Of the 25 recruited cases, 15 (60%) had extramedullary involvement, which occurred as initial presentation in nine cases. The most common extramedullary sites were soft tissue and/or skin (10/15, 67%), followed by pleural effusion, the lungs, and lymph nodes. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells expressed MYC (74%; 17/23), CD56 (56%; 14/25), and cyclin D1 (16%; 4/25), while CD117 was all negative (n = 25). Of the 20 cases stained with p53, four (20%) cases were diffusely positive, and the remaining 16 cases showed a heterogeneous pattern. EBER was negative in all 24 cases examined. Of the 13 cases examined with FISH, the genetic aberrations identified included del(13q14)(92%; 12/13), gain of chromosome 1q (90%; 9/10), loss of chromosome 1p (60%; 6/10), IGH-FGFR3 reciprocal translocation (23%; 3/13), rearranged MYC (15%; 2/13), and rearranged CCND1 (8%; 1/13), while there were no cases with TP53 deletion (n = 10) or rearrangement of BCL2 (n = 13) or BCL6 (n = 13). The prognosis was dismal regardless of the presence or absence of extramedullary involvement. In conclusion, PBM in Taiwan frequently presented as extramedullary and extranodal lesions, particularly in soft tissue and/or skin, mimicking PBL. FISH for targeted genetic alterations such as del(13q14), gain of chromosome 1q, loss of chromosome 1p, and IGH-FGFR3 might be helpful for the differential diagnoses. Larger studies are warranted to investigate the genetic alterations between PBM and PBL.	2022	08	03	Virchows Arch	Chen	Bo-Jung
35659041	10.1186/s13045-022-01295-3	Clinical experiences with venetoclax and other pro-apoptotic agents in lymphoid malignancies: lessons from monotherapy and chemotherapy combination.	BH3-mimetics are a novel drug class of small molecule inhibitors of BCL2 family proteins which restore apoptosis in malignant cells. The only currently approved BH3-mimetic, the selective BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, is highly efficacious in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has rapidly advanced to an approved standard of care in frontline and relapsed disease in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. In this context, tumour lysis syndrome and myelosuppression are the most commonly encountered toxicities and are readily manageable with established protocols. Venetoclax is active in other lymphoid malignancies including several B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma, with the highest intrinsic sensitivity observed in mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Venetoclax combination with standard regimens in follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma and aggressive B cell neoplasms has shown some promise, but further studies are required to optimize dose and scheduling to mitigate increased myelosuppression and infection risk, and to find validated biomarkers of venetoclax sensitivity. Future research will focus on overcoming venetoclax resistance, targeting other BCL2 family members and the rational design of synergistic combinations.	2022	06	08	J Hematol Oncol	Lew	Thomas E
35661922	10.1007/s00428-022-03347-y	H3K27m3 overexpression as a new, BCL2 independent diagnostic tool in follicular and cutaneous follicle center lymphomas.	Approximately 15% of follicular lymphomas (FL) lack overexpression of BCL2 and the underlying translocation t(14;18). These cases can be diagnostically challenging, especially regarding follicular hyperplasia (FH). In a subset of FL, mutations in genes encoding for epigenetic modifiers, such as the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), were found, which might be used diagnostically. These molecular alterations can lead to an increased tri-methylation of histone H3 at position lysine 27 (H3K27m3) that, in turn, can be visualized immunohistochemically. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of H3K27m3 in FL, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphomas (PCFCL), and pediatric-type FL (PTFL) in order to investigate its value in the differential diagnosis to FH and other B cell lymphomas and to correlate it to BCL2 expression and the presence of t(14;18). Additionally, the mutational profile of selected cases was considered to address H3K27m3's potential use as a surrogate parameter for mutations in genes encoding for epigenetic modifiers. Eighty-nine percent of FL and 100% of PCFCL cases overexpressed H3K27m3, independently of BCL2, EZH2, and the presence of mutations. In contrast, 95% of FH and 100% of PTFL cases lacked H3K27m3 overexpression. Other B cell lymphomas considered for differential diagnosis also showed overexpression of H3K27m3 in the majority of cases. In summary, overexpression of H3K27m3 can serve as a new, BCL2 independent marker in the differential diagnosis of FL and PCFCL, but not PTFL, to FH, while being not of help in the differential diagnosis of FL to other B cell lymphomas.	2022	06	06	Virchows Arch	Brune	Magdalena M
35662912	10.1155/2022/9569226	Nanoemulsion and Encapsulation Strategy of Hydrophobic Oregano Essential Oil Increased Human Prostate Cancer Cell Death via Apoptosis by Attenuating Lipid Metabolism.	<i>Origanum vulgare</i> essential oil (EO) is traditionally well-known for its aromatic properties and biomedical applications, including anticancer. This was the first report where oregano essential oil-based nano emulsion (OENE) was synthesized for studying its effects on prostate cancer cell lines (PC3). At first, we have synthesized OENE and characterized using various spectroscopic analyses. The toxicity and inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of OENE toward prostate cancer by MTT analysis were performed. The lipid biogenesis mediated, molecular target pathway analyses were performed using fluorescence cellular staining techniques, real-time RT-PCR, or western blotting analysis. OENE showed IC<sub>50</sub> at 13.82 <i>µ</i>g/mL and significantly induced distinct morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, cell density, and cell shape reduction. In addition, OENE could also significantly decreased lipid droplet accumulation which was confirmed by studying mRNA transcripts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (0.31-fold), fatty acid synthase (FASN) (0.18-fold), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREPB1) (0.11-fold), respectively. Furthermore, there is a significant upregulation BAX (BCL2 associated X) and caspase 3 expressions. Nevertheless, OENE decreased the transcript level of BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), thus resulting in apoptosis. Overall, our present work demonstrated that OENE could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer and warrants in vivo studies.	2022	07	16	Bioinorg Chem Appl	Perumalsamy	Haribalan
35673965	10.1002/1878-0261.13264	The SKP2-p27 axis defines susceptibility to cell death upon CHK1 inhibition.	Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1; encoded by CHEK1) is an essential gene that monitors DNA replication fidelity and prevents mitotic entry in the presence of under-replicated DNA or exogenous DNA damage. Cancer cells deficient in p53 tumor suppressor function reportedly develop a strong dependency on CHK1 for proper cell cycle progression and maintenance of genome integrity, sparking interest in developing kinase inhibitors. Pharmacological inhibition of CHK1 triggers B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-regulated cell death in malignant cells largely independently of p53, and has been suggested to kill p53-deficient cancer cells even more effectively. Next to p53 status, our knowledge about factors predicting cancer cell responsiveness to CHK1 inhibitors is limited. Here, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based loss-of-function screen to identify genes defining sensitivity to chemical CHK1 inhibitors. Next to the proapoptotic BCL2 family member, BCL2 Binding Component 3 (BBC3; also known as PUMA), the F-box protein S-phase Kinase-Associated Protein 2 (SKP2) was validated to tune the cellular response to CHK1 inhibition. SKP2 is best known for degradation of the Cyclin-dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B; also known as p27), thereby promoting G1-S transition and cell cycle progression in response to mitogens. Loss of SKP2 resulted in the predicted increase in p27 protein levels, coinciding with reduced DNA damage upon CHK1-inhibitor treatment and reduced cell death in S-phase. Conversely, overexpression of SKP2, which consequently results in reduced p27 protein levels, enhanced cell death susceptibility to CHK1 inhibition. We propose that assessing SKP2 and p27 expression levels in human malignancies will help to predict the responsiveness to CHK1-inhibitor treatment.	2022	08	05	Mol Oncol	Lohmüller	Michael
35674932	10.1007/s12105-022-01461-6	Extranodal MALT Lymphoma in the Oral Cavity: A Series of Three Cases with Review of Literature.	Diagnosis of MALT lymphoma in the oral cavity is challenging. There is a great overlap in the histopathologic, immuno-histochemical and molecular features of MALT lymphoma with reactive lymphoid proliferations. The literature shows a very few case reports of primary MALT lymphoma of oral cavity. We discuss the histopathologic, immuno-histochemical, cytogenetic features, treatment and behavior of 3 cases of primary MALT lymphoma oral cavity along with review of literature. The age ranged from 40 to 57 years (male to female ratio = 2:1). The sites involved were hard palate, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus and right buccal mucosa. The most common histology was centrocyte-like (2 cases). Lymphoepithelial lesions were absent. On immunohistochemistry, all tumors showed diffuse strong CD20 and bcl2 expression with strong and diffuse MNDA staining in one case. IgH; MALT1 translocation was not seen in any of these cases. One patient received local radiotherapy, one received steroids; while the case 3 received RCHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy. Two patients had complete remission while one had recurrence. MALT lymphoma of oral cavity shows a wide spectrum of morphology with presence of transformed cells, that may lead to misdiagnosis of DLBL. Treatment guidelines are not well established but a tendency to excise MALT lymphomas of oral cavity has been observed. Nevertheless, MALT lymphoma of oral cavity appears to be an indolent disease.	2022	06	08	Head Neck Pathol	Kaur	Ramandeep
35678255	10.1111/jcmm.17358	LncRNA SNHG1 promotes sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting Bcl-2 expression via DNMT1.	Myocardial injury is a frequently occurring complication of sepsis. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1)-mediated DNA methyltransferase 1/B-cell lymphoma-2 (DNMT1/Bcl-2) axis in sepsis-induced myocardial injury. Mice and HL-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish animal and cellular models simulating sepsis and inflammation. LncRNA SNHG1 was screened out as a differentially expressed lncRNA in sepsis samples through microarray profiling, and the upregulated expression of lncRNA SNHG1 was confirmed in myocardial tissues of LPS-induced septic mice and HL-1 cells. Further experiments suggested that silencing of lncRNA SNHG1 reduced the inflammation and apoptotic rate of LPS-induced HL-1 cells. LncRNA SNHG1 inhibited Bcl-2 expression by recruiting DNMT1 to Bcl-2 promoter region to cause methylation. Inhibition of Bcl-2 promoter methylation reduced the inflammation and apoptotic rate of LPS-induced HL-1 cells. In vivo experiments substantiated that lncRNA SNHG1 silencing alleviated sepsis-induced myocardial injury in mice. Taken together, lncRNA SNHG1 promotes LPS-induced myocardial injury in septic mice by downregulating Bcl-2 through DNMT1-mediated Bcl-2 methylation.	2022	07	08	J Cell Mol Med	Zhang	Rui
35685242	10.3389/fmolb.2022.864874	Structural Details of BH3 Motifs and BH3-Mediated Interactions: an Updated Perspective.	Apoptosis is a mechanism of programmed cell death crucial in organism development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and several pathogenic processes. The B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein family lies at the core of the apoptotic process, and the delicate balance between its pro- and anti-apoptotic members ultimately decides the cell fate. BCL2 proteins can bind with each other and several other biological partners through the BCL2 homology domain 3 (BH3), which has been also classified as a possible Short Linear Motif and whose distinctive features remain elusive even after decades of studies. Here, we aim to provide an updated overview of the structural features characterizing BH3s and BH3-mediated interactions (with a focus on human proteins), elaborating on the plasticity of BCL2 proteins and the motif properties. We also discussed the implication of these findings for the discovery of interactors of the BH3-binding groove of BCL2 proteins and the design of mimetics for therapeutic purposes.	2022	07	16	Front Mol Biosci	Sora	Valentina
35687213	10.1007/s10753-022-01696-z	PTX3 Protects Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Damage in Sepsis Through Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway.	This study aims to confirm the protective effect of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on intestinal mucosal barrier damage in sepsis in animal and cell models and explore its mechanism. Analysis of the GSE147775 gene set revealed that the level of PTX3 was upregulated in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat sepsis model. The mice sepsis model was established by cecal ligation perforation (CLP), and the cell inflammation model was induced by LPS. Cell apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related protein were detected by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The PTX3 level was significantly upregulated in the mice sepsis model. Intestinal mucosal barrier damage was aggravated and inflammatory factor expression was upregulated after PTX3 downregulation in sepsis mice. After upregulation of PTX3, intestinal mucosal barrier damage was alleviated and inflammatory factor expression was decreased in sepsis mice. Further data mining suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of PTX3 might be realized through inhibition of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Moreover, compared with the LPS group, downregulation of PTX3 increased cell apoptosis and the levels of BCL2-associated X (Bax), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and decreased the levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), zona occludens (ZO)-1, and occludin. On the contrary, overexpression of PTX3 reduced cell apoptosis and the levels of Bax, MPO, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ. Moreover, downregulation of PTX3 reversed the inhibitive effects on cell apoptosis and inflammation and promotive effects on the levels of Zo-1 and occludin induced by CLI-095 (a TLR signaling pathway inhibitor). In the CLP-induced mice sepsis model and LPS-induced cell inflammation model, PTX3 inhibits inflammatory response and reduces intestinal mucosal barrier damage through the TLR signaling pathway.	2022	06	10	Inflammation	Li	Jian
35701534	10.1038/s41388-022-02372-0	BCL-2 isoform β promotes angiogenesis by TRiC-mediated upregulation of VEGF-A in lymphoma.	Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), the first identified anti-apoptosis factor, encodes two transcripts, the long isoform α and the short isoform β. The current understanding of the Bcl-2 function mainly focuses on Bcl-2α, while little is known about the function of Bcl-2β, which lacks the transmembrane domain and contains 10 unique amino acids at the C-terminus instead. Here, we analyzed the expressions of BCL-2 two isoforms in diffused large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and found a significant positive correlation between them. Then, with the CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activator (CRISPRa), we generated mouse B-cell lymphomas with Bcl-2 upregulation from the endogenous locus, in which both Bcl-2α and Bcl-2β levels were increased. Bcl-2β itself promoted angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo through increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Inhibiting VEGF receptors with Axitinib reduced angiogenesis induced by Bcl-2β overexpression. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Bcl-2β interacted with the T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC). Disruption of TRiC significantly impaired the angiogenesis-promoting activity of Bcl-2β, indicated by reduced VEGF-A protein level and HUVEC tube formation. Thus, our study suggests that Bcl-2 isoform β plays a role in promoting tumor angiogenesis through the Bcl-2β-TRiC-VEGF-A axis.	2022	07	12	Oncogene	Hang	Xiaohang
35704690	10.1182/blood.2021014304	Deregulation and epigenetic modification of BCL2-family genes cause resistance to venetoclax in hematologic malignancies.	The BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax has been approved to treat different hematological malignancies. Since there is no common genetic alteration causing resistance to venetoclax in CLL and B cell lymphoma, we asked if epigenetic events might be involved in venetoclax resistance. Therefore, we employed whole exome sequencing, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening to investigate venetoclax resistance in aggressive lymphoma and high-risk CLL patients. We identified a regulatory CpG island within the PUMA promoter which is methylated upon venetoclax treatment, mediating PUMA downregulation on transcript and protein level. PUMA expression and sensitivity towards venetoclax can be restored by inhibition of methyltransferases. We can demonstrate that loss of PUMA results in metabolic reprogramming with higher OXPHOS and ATP production, resembling the metabolic phenotype that is seen upon venetoclax resistance. While PUMA loss is specific for acquired venetoclax resistance but not for acquired MCL1 resistance and is not seen in CLL patients after chemotherapy-resistance, BAX is essential for sensitivity towards both venetoclax and MCL1 inhibition. As we found loss of BAX in Richter's syndrome patients after venetoclax failure, we defined BAX-mediated apoptosis to be critical for drug resistance but not for disease progression of CLL into aggressive DLBCL in vivo. A compound screen revealed TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as a target to overcome BAX deficiency. Furthermore, antibody or CAR T cells eliminated venetoclax resistant lymphoma cells, paving a clinically applicable way to overcome venetoclax resistance.	2022	06	15	Blood	Thomalla	Daniel
35705274	10.2169/internalmedicine.9711-22	Biclonal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma commonly characterized by partial trisomy 18q involving MALT1 and BCL2.	A 68-year-old man was admitted because of a left shoulder mass and swollen right testis. Pathological examinations indicated a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with the CD20+BCL6+MUM1+BCL2+CD10-MYC- phenotype in both lesions. G-banding of soft tissue showed 47,XY,+18, whereas testicular cells showed 47,X,+X,-Y,der (4) t (4;18) (p15;?),del (5) (q?),+13. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected additional MALT1 and BCL2 signals in both lesions. Southern blot demonstrated different IGH rearrangements between the soft tissue and testis. The patient was diagnosed with biclonal DLBCL with different karyotypes but similar immunophenotypes. Partial trisomy 18q involving MALT1 and BCL2 may be commonly involved in the pathogenesis of this biclonal DLBCL.	2022	06	15	Intern Med	Yamamoto	Katsuya
35709931	10.1016/j.drudis.2022.06.002	BCL2 G quadruplex-binding small molecules: Current status and prospects for the development of next-generation anticancer therapeutics.	B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) overexpression in a range of human tumors is often related to chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. GC-rich regions upstream of the P1 promoter in human BCL2 can form G-quadruplex (G4) structures through the stacking of four Hoogsteen-paired guanine bases. Stabilizing the G4 fold implies the inhibition of BCL2 expression and, thus, small molecules that selectively bind to the G4 are promising anticancer candidates. In this review, we discuss the structural aspects, binding affinity, selectivity, and biological activity of well-characterized BCL2 G4 binding ligands in vitro and in vivo. We also explore future directions in the research and development of G4-based anticancer therapeutics.	2022	08	30	Drug Discov Today	Singh	Mamta
35715938	10.1002/cjp2.283	Decreased CD11c-positive dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment predict double-hit/triple-hit genotype and survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is a potentially curable disease. However, it is heterogenous, and the prognosis is poor if the tumor cells harbor fusions involving MYC and BCL2 or MYC and BCL6 (double-hit [DH] lymphoma), or fusions involving all three genes (triple-hit [TH] lymphoma). Fluorescence in situ hybridization is currently the gold standard for confirming the presence of DH/TH genotypes. However, the test is laborious and not readily available in some laboratories. Germinal center B (GCB) signatures and dual expression of MYC and BCL2 are commonly used as initial screening markers (traditional model) in clinical practice. Our study proposes immunohistochemical markers for more conveniently and accessibly screening DH/TH genotypes in DLBCL. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and pathological parameters of patients with DLBCL. We assessed the proliferative index, apoptotic index, and tumor microenvironment (TME), with regard to T cells and CD11c(+) dendritic cells, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We then generated a decision tree as a screening algorithm to predict DH/TH genotypes and employed decision curve analysis to demonstrate the superiority of this new model in prediction. We also assessed the prognostic significance of related parameters. Our study revealed that GCB subtypes, a Ki67 proliferative index higher than 70%, and BCL2 expression were significantly associated with DH/TH genotypes. Decreased CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the TME indicated additional risk. Our proposed screening algorithm outperformed a traditional model in screening for the DH/TH genotypes. In addition, decreased CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the DLBCL TME were an independent unfavorable prognosticator. In conclusion, we provide a convenient, well-performing model that predicts DH/TH genotypes in DLBCL. The prognostic significance of CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the TME might influence the classification and development of immunotherapy for DLBCL in the future.	2022	08	08	J Pathol Clin Res	Yuan	Chang-Tsu
35716968	10.1016/j.fsi.2022.06.017	Dietary chlorella (Chlorella vulgaris) supplementation effectively improves body color, alleviates muscle inflammation and inhibits apoptosis in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).	Muscle quality, antioxidant status, and inflammatory and apoptotic molecule expression were investigated in juvenile largemouth bass fed five levels of Chlorella for 60 days. The results showed that muscle quality can be improved by increasing the muscle crude protein content, muscle and skin brightness value (L*), redness value (a*) and yellowness value (b*) in Chlorella-supplemented diets without affecting the growth and muscle fiber development of fish. Chlorella supplementation did not cause oxidative stress in muscle, but optimal Chlorella administration alleviated the muscle inflammatory response by downregulating the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated proinflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Moreover, anti-apoptotic effects were induced by upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, such as b cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (mcl-1), and downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, including bcl2-associated x (bax) and caspase3. In conclusion, Chlorella improved muscle quality, alleviated muscle inflammation and resisted muscle apoptosis.	2022	08	17	Fish Shellfish Immunol	Yu	Heng
35749795	10.1097/MCP.0000000000000879	Senescence in pulmonary arterial hypertension: is there a link?	Cellular senescence has been recognized as a promising target in the treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. The pathways involved in the development of senescence share many similarities with pathobiological mechanisms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). But the potential of senolytics to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and to reduce vascular remodelling in PAH has thus far not been investigated in depth. PAH does not seem to be a disease of only young people since the mean age of PAH patients is constantly increasing. Changes in expression of senescence biomarkers related to cell cycle arrest, namely upregulation of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and the cell cycle inhibitors p16ink4A an p21cip1 as well as an increase in apoptosis resistance biomarker Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) and development of senescence-associated phenotype characterized by excessive production of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and interleukin 6 were demonstrated in PAH patients. Initiatives to link the senescence-modulating effect of certain compounds to clinically relevant outcomes in PAH are still limited. Further exploration of the role of senescence in the pathobiology of PAH may point to new relevant treatment strategies. Identification of the cell-specific senescence biomarkers which can be used in vivo, could further promote identification of clinically relevant pathways and design of clinical studies which will help to establish effective therapeutic use of senolytic compounds.	2022	06	28	Curr Opin Pulm Med	Semen	Khrystyna O
35759728	10.1182/blood.2022015926	Aberrant expansion of spontaneous splenic germinal centers induced by hallmark genetic lesions of aggressive lymphoma.	Unique molecular vulnerabilities have been identified in the aggressive MCD/C5 genetic subclass of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the premalignant cell-of-origin exhibiting MCD-like dependencies remains elusive. In this study, we examined animals carrying up to 4 hallmark genetic lesions found in MCD consisting of gain-of-function mutations in Myd88 and Cd79b, loss of Prdm1, and overexpression of BCL2. We discovered that expression of combinations of these alleles in vivo promoted a cell-intrinsic accumulation of B cells in spontaneous splenic germinal centers (GCs). As with MCD, these premalignant B cells were enriched for B-cell receptors (BCRs) with evidence of self-reactivity, displayed a de novo dependence on Tlr9, and were more sensitive to inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Mutant spontaneous splenic GC B cells (GCB) showed increased proliferation and IRF4 expression. Mice carrying all 4 genetic lesions showed a &gt;50-fold expansion of spontaneous splenic GCs exhibiting aberrant histologic features with a dark zone immunophenotype and went on to develop DLBCL in the spleen with age. Thus, by combining multiple hallmark genetic alterations associated with MCD, our study identifies aberrant spontaneous splenic GCBs as a likely cell-of-origin for this aggressive genetic subtype of lymphoma.	2022	09	13	Blood	Pindzola	Grace M
35760783	10.1038/s41419-022-05021-2	IDO1 plays a tumor-promoting role via MDM2-mediated suppression of the p53 pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	With the intensive therapeutic strategies, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is still a fatal disease due to its progressive characteristics. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key regulator that catalyzes the commitment step of the kynurenine pathway in the immune system, its aberrant activation may contribute to malignant cell escape eradication. However, the role of IDO1 in DLBCL progression remains elusive. Our study showed IDO1 expression was upregulated in DLBCL and was associated with a poor prognosis and low overall survival. Inhibition of IDO1 suppressed DLBCL cell proliferation in vitro and impeded xenograft tumorigenesis in vivo. RNA-seq analyses revealed MDM2 was downregulated while TP53 was upregulated in IDO1 inhibition OCI-Ly10 cells. Mechanistically, IDO1 inhibition decreased the expression of MDM2, a major negative regulator of p53, and restored p53 expression in OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10 cells, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. IDO1 inhibition induced cell apoptosis coupled with PUMA and BAX upregulation, as well as BCL2 and BCL-XL downregulation. In addition, p21, a p53 transcriptional target, was upregulated in cell cycle arrest. Taken together, this study revealed IDO1 is essential for the proliferation of DLBCL cells and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of DLBCL.	2022	06	29	Cell Death Dis	Sun	Chengtao
35762155	10.1080/10520295.2022.2083685	Effects of long term diabetogenic high fat diet on bone in ovariectomized female rats.	A diabetogenic high fat diet (HFD) can be used to induce insulin resistance and obesity in animal models; however, its effects on bone are unknown. We investigated the effects of long term HFD on bone in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. We used 12-week-old female rats divided randomly into four groups: sham operation (sham), sham operation with HFD (SHFD), OVX and OVX with HFD (OVX + HFD). Ovaries were removed in the OVX and OVX + HFD groups and the SHFD and OVX + HFD groups were fed a HFD for 28 weeks. Serum estrogen, testosterone, lipid, adiponectin, leptin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and <i>N</i>-mid fragment of osteocalcin (N-MID-OT) levels were measured. Structure, apoptosis and specific transcription factors in bone were evaluated using pathologic, densitometric and immunohistochemical analysis. Body weight, serum leptin, TRAP and testosterone levels were increased, while serum <i>N</i>-MID-OT, estrogen and adiponectin levels were decreased in the SHFD, OVX and OVX + HFD groups. Expression of BCL2-associated X protein, caspase-3, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and calcitonin was increased, while bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) in femurs and lumbar spine, and expression of B cell lymphoma 2, type 1 collagen and osteocalcin were decreased in the bones of the SHFD, OVX and OVX + HFD groups. All indices were greatest in the OVX + HFD group and HFD produced a detrimental effect on bone in both normal and OVX rats, which may be due to increased apoptosis in bone and increased leptin and decreased adiponectin levels in serum. The effects of HFD and OVX may be synergistic.	2022	06	28	Biotech Histochem	Dai	Fang
35770040	10.2147/TCRM.S338655	Zanubrutinib in Treating Waldenström Macroglobulinemia, the Last Shall Be the First.	In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma characterized by monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) gammopathy, aberrant Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling has been identified as one mechanism of pathogenesis. For this reason, selective BTK inhibiting therapies have emerged as an attractive option for treatment within the therapeutic landscape also comprising chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors. The first BTK inhibiting therapy, ibrutinib, showed great efficacy in treating WM. However, response rates were dependent on whether patients had the <i>CXCR4</i> mutation, a molecular aberration that may confer resistance to BTK inhibitors. Furthermore, ibrutinib's toxicities, most notably hypertension and atrial arrhythmia, led to dose reductions or discontinuation. The toxicity profile of ibrutinib can be attributed to the inhibition of additional kinases that are structurally related to BTK. Therefore, the next-generation highly selective zanubrutinib was developed to address the concerns regarding toxicity and tolerance related to ibrutinib therapy. Based on the results of the randomized, open-label Phase 3 ASPEN (NCT03053440) trial, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved zanubrutinib for treating WM. This trial directly compared zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in patients with treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory WM, and the results showed stronger responses with zanubrutinib. More importantly, patients responded strongly to zanubrutinib therapy regardless of <i>CXCR4</i> mutation status. Additionally, zanubrutinib was associated with fewer grade 3 or higher toxicities and was generally better tolerated. Another Phase 1/2 study has been conducted with just zanubrutinib in WM showcasing high efficacy with few toxicities as well. Even though zanubrutinib has been the third and last BTK inhibitor to currently penetrate the market for B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancies, we highlight the emergence of zanubrutinib as a key player in the forefront of the therapeutic landscape in WM.	2022	07	16	Ther Clin Risk Manag	Deshpande	Anagha
35774514	10.3389/fgene.2022.827840	A Novel Defined Super-Enhancer Associated Gene Signature to Predict Prognosis in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	<b>Background:</b> Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease that can have profound differences in survival outcomes. A variety of powerful prognostic factors and models have been constructed; however, the development of more accurate prognosis prediction and targeted treatment for DLBCL still faces challenges. An explosion of research on super-enhancer (SE)-associated genes provide the possibility to use in prognostication for cancer patients. Here, we aimed to establish a novel effective prognostic model using SE-associated genes from DLBCL. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,105 DLBCL patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were included in this study and were divided into a training set and a validation set. A total of 11 SE-associated genes (BCL2, SPAG16, PXK, BTG1, LRRC37A2, EXT1, TGFBR2, ANKRD12, MYCBP2, PAX5, and MYC) were initially screened and identified by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalized Cox regression, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Finally, a risk score model based on these 11 genes was constructed. <b>Results:</b> Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves showed that the low-risk group appeared to have better clinical survival outcomes. The excellent performance of the model was determined <i>via</i> time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A nomogram based on the polygenic risk score was further established to promote reliable prognostic prediction. This study proposed that the SE-associated-gene risk signature can effectively predict the response to chemotherapy in DLBCL patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> A novel and reliable SE-associated-gene signature that can effectively classify DLBCL patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in terms of overall survival was developed, which may assist clinicians in the treatment of DLBCL.	2022	07	16	Front Genet	Xu	Hong
35782651	10.1093/toxres/tfac024	Isorhamnetin: a flavonoid, attenuated doxorubicin-induced testicular injury via regulation of steroidogenic enzymes and apoptotic signaling gene expression in male rats.	Male reproductive damage is one of the most adverse side effects of doxorubicin (DOX). Isorhamnetin is a natural flavonoid, which displays remarkable antioxidant potential. The current research was designed to assess the protective effects of Isorhamnetin against DOX-instigated testicular damages. Adult male Wistar rats (n=32) were divided into 4 groups: control, DOX (3 mg/kg i.p. 3 doses each after 1 week), DOX + Isorhamnetin (3 mg/kg 3 doses each after 1 week +10 mg/kg i.p. daily for 28 days, respectively), and Isorhamnetin (10 mg/kg i.p. per day). After 28 days of treatment, biochemical, spermatogenic, steroidogenic, hormonal, proapoptotic, antiapoptotic, and histopathological parameters were estimated. DOX exposure significantly decreased the activity of acid phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Furthermore, DOX substantially decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e. catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase along with protein content, whereas it increased the malondialdehyde level. It also reduced sperm progressive motility, viability, the number of hypoosmotic tail swelled spermatozoa, and epididymis sperm count and increased the sperm morphological anomalies (head, midpiece, and tail). Besides, it decreased the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and plasma testosterone and lowered the expression of steroidogenic enzymes (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and testicular antiapoptotic marker (B-cell lymphoma 2) but increased the expression of proapoptotic markers (BCL2-associated X protein and caspase-3) along with histopathological impairments. However, isorhamnetin prevented all the damages caused by DOX. Conclusively, Isorhamnetin can be used as a powerful mitigating agent to avert DOX-induced testicular damages.	2022	09	01	Toxicol Res (Camb)	Mustafa	Shama
35783530	10.1155/2022/9100056	LINC00461 Regulates the Recurrence of Large B Cell Lymphoma through the miR-411-5p/BNIP3 Pathway.	To analyze the mechanism of LINC00461 regulating the recurrence of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) through microRNA (miR)-411-5p/BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) pathway. DLBCL samples in TCGA and GSE12453 were used for differential analysis to find long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) related to DLBCL recurrence. The 4 DLBCL data with the highest and lowest expression levels of LINC00461 in the TCGA database were selected for GSEA enrichment analysis. The targeting relationships of miR-411-5p with LINC00461 and BNIP3 were verified by the dual luciferase report. Blood samples from DLBCL patients were used to analyze the correlation between miR-411-5p and LINC00461 or BNIP3. LINC00461, miR-411-5p, or BNIP3 was overexpressed or silenced by transfection, and a tumor-bearing nude mice model was constructed to detect their effects on proliferation and apoptosis. The level of LINC00461 in DLBCL was significantly higher than that in normal cases, and the level in recurrence DLBCL was significantly higher than that in nonrecurrence. The enrichment analysis results showed that the function of LINC00461 was closely related to apoptosis. The results shown that miR-411-5p bound to LINC00461 and BNIP3 and was negatively correlated with LINC00461 and BNIP3 mRNA in blood of DLBCL patients. Suppressing the level of LINC00461 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. The inhibition of LINC00461 or overexpression of miR-411-5p reduced the expression of BNIP3 protein, thereby inducing apoptosis at the in vivo and in vitro levels. LINC00461 may induce miR-411-5p to ""sponge,"" thereby increasing the expression of BNIP3 protein, and exerting the function of inhibiting apoptosis and promoting DLBCL recurrence.	2022	07	16	Evid Based Complement Alternat Med	Sun	Shu-Wen
35787399	10.1016/j.jid.2022.06.005	The Robust Tumoricidal Effects of Combined BET/HDAC Inhibition in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Can Be Reproduced by ΔNp73 Depletion.	Combined BET inhibitor/histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment induces marked apoptosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with minimal normal T-cell toxicity. At 96 hours when apoptosis was extensive, a majority of CTCL lines showed ≥2-fold suppression of T-cell survival factors (e.g., AKT1, BCL2 antiapoptotic factors, BIRC5, CD40, CD70, GADD45A, PRKCA, TNFRSF1B, ΔNp73) and ≥2-fold upregulation of proapoptotic factors and tumor suppressors (e.g., ATM, BAK, BIM, multiple caspases, FHIT, HIC1, MGMT, NOD1) (P &lt; 0.05). The largest alterations were in TP73 isoform expression, resulting in increased TAp73/ΔNp73 ratios in CTCL lines and leukemic Sézary cells. Targeted ΔNp73 inhibition by small interfering RNA knockdown resulted in robust CTCL apoptosis comparable with that induced by BET inhibitor/histone deacetylase inhibitor with minimal normal T-cell toxicity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that BET inhibitor/histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment reduced RNA polymerase II binding to ΔNp73, MYC, and AKT1 while increasing its binding to TAp73. CTCL skin lesions expressed both TAp73 and ΔNp73 isoforms in situ. In aggregate, these findings implicate TAp73/ΔNp73 balance as a major factor governing CTCL survival, show that the expression of p73 isoforms can be altered by molecular biological and pharmaceutical means, show that p73 isoforms are expressed across the entire CTCL clinical spectrum, and identify the p73 pathway as a potential target for therapeutics.	2022	08	21	J Invest Dermatol	Zhao	Lei
35792817	10.1080/10790268.2022.2088498	Warm acupuncture therapy alleviates neuronal apoptosis after spinal cord injury via inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway.	Warm acupuncture (WA) therapy has been applied to treat spinal cord injury (SCI), but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The current study attempted to explore the WA therapy on neuronal apoptosis of SCI and the relationship with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. The rat SCI models were established by the impact method. SCI rat models were subjected to WA treatment at <i>Dazhui</i> (GV14) and <i>Jiaji</i> points (T10), <i>Yaoyangguan</i> (GV3), <i>Zusanli</i> (ST36), and <i>Ciliao</i> (BL32). The rat SCI models were established by the impact method. WA and U0126 treatments were performed on the SCI rats. Motor function and neuronal apoptosis were detected. The relative mRNA of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), the phosphorylation level of ERK 1/2 and levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-Associated X (Bax), and caspase-3 in spinal cord tissue were tested. After WA treatment, the Basso, Beattie &amp; Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB scale) of SCI rats in the WA treatment was significantly raised from 7 to 14 days after SCI. WA and U0126 treatment significantly diminished apoptotic cells and preserved the neurons in the injured spinal cord. WA and U0126 treatment alleviated the production of inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord. The distinct increase of p-ERK 1/2 induced by SCI was reversed in WA and U0126 treatment groups. WA and U0126 treatment augmented the level of Bcl-2 and reversed the elevated cleaved caspase-3 protein level after SCI. Our study demonstrated that WA might be associated with the downregulation of the ERK signaling pathway. In summary, our findings indicated that WA promotes the recovery of SCI via the protection of nerve cells and the prevention of apoptosis. Meanwhile, the anti-apoptotic effect of WA might be associated with the downregulation of the ERK signaling pathway, which could be one of the mechanisms of WA in the treatment of SCI.	2022	07	06	J Spinal Cord Med	Ding	Li-Li-Qiang
35794478	10.1038/s41586-022-04906-8	Super-enhancer hypermutation alters oncogene expression in B cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets<sup>1-5</sup>. However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance.	2022	07	29	Nature	Bal	Elodie
35800619	10.1016/j.bbrep.2022.101303	CA10 is associated with HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main threat for the patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the oncogenic mechanism of HBV-related HCC is still controversial. Previously, we have found that several HBV surface gene (HBS) non-sense mutations are oncogenic. Among these mutations, sW182* was found to have the most potent oncogenicity. In this study, we found that Carbonic Anhydrase X (CA10) level was specifically increased in sW182* mutant-expressing cells. CA10 overexpression was also associated with HBS nonsense mutation in HBV-related HCC tumor tissues. Transformation and tumorigenesis assays revealed that CA10 had significant oncogenic activity. In addition, CA10 overexpression resulted in dysregulation of apoptosis-related proteins, including Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bad. While searching for the regulatory mechanism of CA10, miR-27b was found to downregulate CA10 expression by regulating its mRNA degradation and its expression was decreased in sW182* mutant cells. Moreover, CA10 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of miR-27b in human HBV-related HCC tumor tissues with sW182* mutation. Therefore, induction of the expression of CA10 through repression of miR-27b by sW182* might be one mechanism involved in HBS mutation-related hepatocarcinogenesis.	2022	07	16	Biochem Biophys Rep	Chung	Kuei-Min
35804999	10.3390/cancers14133229	Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy-Based Approaches in Mantle Cell Lymphoma.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) characterized by the translocation t(11;14) (q13;q32) and a poor response to rituximab-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. High-dose cytarabine-based regimens offer a durable response, but an important number of MCL patients are not eligible for intensive treatment and are ideal candidates for novel targeted therapies (such as BTK, proteasome or BCL2 inhibitors, Immunomodulatory Drugs (IMiDs), bispecific antibodies, or CAR-T cell therapy). On the bench side, several studies aiming to integrate the tumor within its ecosystem highlighted a critical role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the expansion and resistance of MCL. This led to important insights into the role of the TME in the management of MCL, including potential targets and biomarkers. Indeed, targeted agents often have a combined mechanism of action on the tumor B cell but also on the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this review is to briefly describe the current knowledge on the biology of the TME in MCL and expose the results of the different therapeutic strategies integrating the TME in this disease.	2022	07	16	Cancers (Basel)	Saleh	Khalil
35816682	10.1182/bloodadvances.2022008355	Genomic and microenvironmental landscape of stage I follicular lymphoma, compared to stage III/IV.	While the genomic and immune microenvironmental landscape of follicular lymphoma (FL) has been extensively investigated, little is known regarding potential biological differences between stage I and stage III/IV disease. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry, 82 FL nodal stage I cases were analysed and compared to 139 FL stage III/IV nodal cases. Many similarities in mutations, chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) and microenvironmental cell populations were detected. However, there were also significant differences in microenvironmental and genomic features. CD8+ T-cells (p=0.02) and STAT6 mutations (FDR&lt;0.001), were more frequent in stage I FL. In contrast, PD1+ T-cells, CD68+/CD163+ macrophages (p&lt;0.001), BCL2 translocation (BCL2trl+) (p&lt;0.0001), KMT2D (FDR=0.003) and CREBBP (FDR=0.04) mutations were found more frequently in stage III/IV FL. By clustering we identified three clusters within stage I, and two within stage III/IV. The BLC2trl+ stage I cluster was comparable to the BCL2trl+ cluster in stage III/IV. The two BCL2trl- stage I clusters were unique for stage I. One was enriched for CREBBP (95%) and STAT6 (64%) mutations, without BLC6 translocation (BCL6trl), whereas the BCL2trl- stage III/IV cluster contained BCL6trl (64%) with less CREBBP (45%) and STAT6 (9%) mutations. The other BCL2trl- stage I cluster was relatively heterogeneous with more CNAs and linker histone mutations. This exploratory study shows that FL stage I is genetically heterogenous with different underlying oncogenic pathways. Stage I FL BCL2trl- is likely STAT6 driven while BCL2trl- stage III/IV appears to be more BCL6trl driven.	2022	07	11	Blood Adv	Los-de Vries	G Tjitske
35830966	10.1111/ijlh.13928	Downregulation of hsa-miR-548d-3p and overexpression of HOXA9 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and the risk of R-CHOP chemotherapy resistance and disease progression.	Routine categorization of DLBCL patients into GCB and non-GCB groups by Hans' criteria could not accurately predict chemotherapy resistance and disease progression in patients treated with standard R-CHOP therapy. There is a need to identify better biomarker predictors to enhance assisted selection of chemotherapy regimens for DLBCL patients. To identify dysregulated miRNAs and mRNAs that are predictive of resistance to R-CHOP chemotherapy or disease progression in patients with DLBCL. miRNA and mRNA profiling were performed on archival FFPE samples of the DLBCL patients. miRabel and miRNet bioinformatic tools were applied to determine experimental validated miRNA-mRNA target interaction. The significance of the genomic predictive values was assessed using adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). 19/36 were R-CHOP therapy-resistant whilst 17/36 were R-CHOP therapy-sensitive. Ten dysregulated miRNAs and 12 dysregulated mRNAs were identified in therapy-resistant DLBCL patients. These dysregulated miRNAs and mRNA cause therapy resistance and disease progression in DLBCL patients, most likely via upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2, activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and dysregulation of p53 pathway. Downregulation of hsa-miR-548d-3p and overexpression of HOXA9 mRNA were significantly associated with therapy resistance and disease progression in DLBCL patients [hsa-miR-548d-3p AOR: 0.258, 95%CI: 0.097-0.684, p = 0.006]. DLBCL patients with downregulation of hsa-miR-548d-3p and overexpression of HOXA9 mRNA are more likely to experience R-CHOP therapy resistance and disease progression.	2022	07	13	Int J Lab Hematol	Ting	Choo-Yuen
35846201	10.1002/jha2.310	Redefining the high-grade B cell lymphoma with double/triple rearrangements of MYC and BCL2/BCL6 genes. Learning from a case report.	We report a patient initially diagnosed with a triple hit high-grade B cell lymphoma (HGBL-TH), in which further morphologic, immunohistochemical, and next-generation sequencing studies of subsequent specimens disclosed it to be a germinal center diffuse large B cell lymphoma (GC-DLBCL) with <i>BCL2/BCL6</i> gene translocations, <i>PVT1</i>-deletion, and gain of <i>MYC</i> genes evolving from a previous follicular lymphoma. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies with the break-apart probe for MYC gene showed a fusion and two separated signals (red and green, respectively) leading to the interpretation of MYC gene translocation and a false diagnosis of a TH-lymphoma, according to the recent WHO classification. Nevertheless, <i>PVT1</i> deletion plus <i>MYC</i> gain/amplification has been described as a cause of the double-hi transcription profile.

Hymeglusin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 1 (HMGCS1), regulates the mevalonate pathway, which is vital for AML growth and chemosensitivity. The effects of the combination of venetoclax and hymeglusin on AML were explored in this study. The correlations between HMGCS1 and apoptosis-related genes were analyzed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Apoptosis and cell viability were detected in HL-60 and KG-1 cells after treatment with gradient concentrations of venetoclax or hymeglusin. The transcriptomic profiles of HL-60 and KG-1 cells were compared <i>via</i> RNA-Seq analysis. The effects of venetoclax and hymeglusin on apoptosis were validated in primary cells. The results showed that HMGCS1 expression was closely associated with apoptosis-related genes based on the data from large clinical databases. B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 expression was elevated in AML and negatively associated with overall survival. Hymeglusin decreased BCL2 expression levels in HL-60 and KG-1 cells. Venetoclax and hymeglusin inhibited cell viability in both cell lines, but induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. This discrepancy in sensitivity to hymeglusin may be attributed to the positive increase in the expression levels of HMGCS1 and multiple upregulated pro-leukemia genes in KG-1 cells. Combination treatment with venetoclax and hymeglusin significantly increased the apoptotic rates compared to single-agent treatment in both AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Furthermore, the combination strategy did not result in remarkably enhanced toxicity in normal mononuclear cells. Collectively, hymeglusin enhanced the effects of venetoclax on apoptosis. This combination strategy showed enhanced antileukemic activity with acceptable toxicity in AML.	2022	07	19	Front Oncol	Zhou	Cheng
35848706	10.4103/aja202242	The protective effects and underlying mechanisms of dapagliflozin on diabetes-induced testicular dysfunction.	Male diabetic individuals present a marked impairment in fertility; however, knowledge regarding the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies is unsatisfactory. The new hypoglycemic drug dapagliflozin has shown certain benefits, such as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events in patients with diabetes. Even so, until now, the effects and underlying mechanisms of dapagliflozin on diabetic male infertility have awaited clarification. Here, we found that dapagliflozin lowered blood glucose levels, alleviated seminiferous tubule destruction, and increased sperm concentrations and motility in leptin receptor-deficient diabetic db/db mice. Moreover, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist exendin (9-39) had no effect on glucose levels but reversed the protective effects of dapagliflozin on testicular structure and sperm quality in db/db mice. We also found that dapagliflozin inhibited the testicular apoptotic process by upregulating the expression of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and inhibiting oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant status, including total antioxidant capacity, total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, as well as decreasing the level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Exendin (9-39) administration partially reversed these effects. Furthermore, dapagliflozin upregulated the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level in plasma and GLP-1R expression by promoting AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog (Akt) phosphorylation in testicular tissue. Exendin (9-39) partially inhibited Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that dapagliflozin protects against diabetes-induced spermatogenic dysfunction via activation of the GLP-1R/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Our results indicate the potential effects of dapagliflozin against diabetes-induced spermatogenic dysfunction.	2022	07	18	Asian J Androl	Luo	Zhi-Chao
35851082		[Paeoniflorin inhibits Wnt1/β-catenin pathway and promotes apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by upregulating lncRNA MALAT1].	Objective To explore the effect and mechanism of paeoniflorin (PAE) on apoptosis of fibroblast synovial cells derived from rheumatoid arthritis tissues. Methods Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synovial cells (RA-FLSs) were cultured under different concentrations of PAE (20, 40, 80 μmol/L). Survival rate of cells was determined at different incubation time-points (24, 48, 72 hours) by MTT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to determine apoptosis rate of cells. Cells were transfected with 3 small interfering RNAs(siRNAs) fragments of long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(lncRNA MALAT1) for 48 hours. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to determine if MALAT1 knockdown was successful. Cells were assigned into control group, PAE group, si-NC group, si-MALAT1 group and PAE combined with si-MALAT1 group. Cell apoptosis rate was determined by flow cytometry after knockdown of MALAT1 expression. mRNA expression levels of Wnt1, β-catenin, caspase-3, caspase-9, B-cell lymphoma 2(Bcl2) and Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX) were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. Western blot analysis was performed to determine protein expression levels of Wnt1, β-catenin, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl2 and BAX in each group. Results The findings showed that incubation of RA-FLSs with PAE at the tested concentration decreased their viability in a time-dependent manner. Expression level of lncRNA MALAT1 was lower in RA-FLSs group compared with the level in NC-FLSs group. Analysis showed that apoptosis rate was higher in cells treated with PAE. si-MALAT1 group had the lowest apoptosis rate, whereas the PAE combined with si-MALAT1 group showed a significantly higher apoptosis rate compared with si-MALAT1 group. mRNA levels of Bcl2, Wnt1 and β-catenin were lower in PAE group compared with the level in control group, whereas mRNA expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-9 and BAX were higher in PAE group compared with the levels in control group. Expression level of Bcl2 was significantly higher in si-MALAT1 group compared with the level in the control group. Expression level of BAX, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were higher in PAE combined with si-MALAT1 group compared with the level in the control group. Conclusion PAE promotes apoptosis and inhibits the Wnt1/β-catenin pathway in RA-FLSs by upregulating expression of lncRNA MALAT1.	2022	07	20	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Yang	Fan
35856441	10.3892/or.2022.8375	Administration of 4‑hexylresorcinol increases p53‑mediated transcriptional activity in oral cancer cells with the p53 mutation.	The p53 mutation is inherent in over 50% of human cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the p53 mutation is associated with a poor prognosis. 4‑Hexylresorcinol (4HR) is a pharmacologic chaperone. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of 4HR on p53 transcriptional activity in oral carcinoma cells with p53 mutations. To identify conformational changes induced by 4HR administration, peptides including the DNA‑binding domain from mutant and wild‑type p53 were synthesized, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed. To determine the effect of 4HR on p53 mutant carcinoma cells, western blot analysis, p53 transcriptional activity analysis, MTT assay and apoptosis immunocytochemistry were performed. The YD‑15 cell line has a mutation in the DNA binding domain of p53 (Glu258Ala). When p53 Ala‑258 was coupled by 4HR, the p53 Ala‑258 structure lost its original conformation and approached a conformation similar to that of p53 Glu‑258. In the cell experiments, 4HR administration to p53 mutant cells increased p53 transcriptional activity and the expression levels of apoptosis‑associated proteins such as B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2‑associated X (BAX) and BCL2‑associated agonist of cell death (BAD). Accordingly, 4HR administration on YD‑15 cells decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. In conclusion, 4HR is a potential substance for use in the recovery of loss‑of‑function in mutant p53 as a pharmacologic chaperone.	2022	07	21	Oncol Rep	Kang	Yei-Jin
35857625	10.1126/scitranslmed.abl5654	Phenotypic screening with deep learning identifies HDAC6 inhibitors as cardioprotective in a BAG3 mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy.	Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by reduced cardiac output, as well as thinning and enlargement of left ventricular chambers. These characteristics eventually lead to heart failure. Current standards of care do not target the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with genetic forms of heart failure, driving a need to develop novel therapeutics for DCM. To identify candidate therapeutics, we developed an in vitro DCM model using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) deficient in B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3). With these BAG3-deficient iPSC-CMs, we identified cardioprotective drugs using a phenotypic screen and deep learning. From a library of 5500 bioactive compounds and siRNA validation, we found that inhibiting histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) was cardioprotective at the sarcomere level. We translated this finding to a BAG3 cardiomyocyte-knockout (BAG3<sup>cKO</sup>) mouse model of DCM, showing that inhibiting HDAC6 with two isoform-selective inhibitors (tubastatin A and a novel inhibitor TYA-018) protected heart function. In BAG3<sup>cKO</sup> and BAG3<sup>E455K</sup> mice, HDAC6 inhibitors improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced left ventricular diameter at diastole and systole. In BAG3<sup>cKO</sup> mice, TYA-018 protected against sarcomere damage and reduced <i>Nppb</i> expression. Based on integrated transcriptomics and proteomics and mitochondrial function analysis, TYA-018 also enhanced energetics in these mice by increasing expression of targets associated with fatty acid metabolism, protein metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate the power of combining iPSC-CMs with phenotypic screening and deep learning to accelerate drug discovery, and they support developing novel therapies that address underlying mechanisms associated with heart disease.	2022	07	22	Sci Transl Med	Yang	Jin
35857791	10.1080/15548627.2022.2100105	Lack of COL6/collagen VI causes megakaryocyte dysfunction by impairing autophagy and inducing apoptosis.	Endoplasmic reticulum stress is an emerging significant player in the molecular pathology of connective tissue disorders. In response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, cells can upregulate macroautophagy/autophagy, a fundamental cellular homeostatic process used by cells to degrade and recycle proteins or remove damaged organelles. In these scenarios, autophagy activation can support cell survival. Here we demonstrated by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> approaches that megakaryocytes derived from <i>col6a1</i><sup>-⁄-</sup> (collagen, type VI, alpha 1) null mice display increased intracellular retention of COL6 polypeptides, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. The unfolded protein response is activated in <i>col6a1</i><sup>-⁄-</sup> megakaryocytes, as evidenced by the upregulation of molecular chaperones, by the increased splicing of <i>Xbp1</i> mRNA and by the higher level of the pro-apoptotic regulator DDIT3/CHOP. Despite the endoplasmic reticulum stress, basal autophagy is impaired in <i>col6a1</i><sup>-⁄-</sup> megakaryocytes, which show lower BECN1 levels and reduced autophagosome maturation. Starvation and rapamycin treatment rescue the autophagic flux in <i>col6a1</i><sup>-⁄-</sup> megakaryocytes, leading to a decrease in intracellular COL6 polypeptide retention, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, megakaryocytes cultured from peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors of patients affected by Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, two COL6-related disorders, displayed increased apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and impaired autophagy. These data demonstrate that genetic disorders of collagens, endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy regulation in megakaryocytes may be interrelated.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 7-AAD: 7-amino-actinomycin D; ATF: activating transcriptional factor; BAX: BCL2 associated X protein; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BCL2L1/Bcl-xL: BCL2-like 1; BM: bone marrow; COL6: collagen, type VI; <i>col6a1<sup>-⁄-</sup></i>: mice that are null for <i>Col6a1</i>; DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153: DNA-damage inducible transcript 3; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; reticulophagy: endoplasmic reticulum-selective autophagy; HSPA5/Bip: heat shock protein 5; HSP90B1/GRP94: heat shock protein 90, beta (Grp94), member 1; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; Mk: megakaryocytes; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NIMV: noninvasive mechanical ventilation; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PPP1R15A/GADD34: protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 15A; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SERPINH1/HSP47: serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade H, member 1; sh-RNA: short hairpin RNA; SOCE: store operated calcium entry; UCMD: Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy; UPR: unfolded protein response; WIPI2: WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide-interacting 2; WT: wild type; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1.	2022	07	20	Autophagy	Abbonante	Vittorio
35861049	10.1002/jsfa.12141	Research on apoptotic mechanism and related pathways involving in postmortem grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) muscle.	Apoptosis activation is an essential research to reveal the triggering mechanism of flesh quality deterioration. This study was aimed at explaining apoptotic mechanism of postmortem fish in terms of caspases activation, cytochrome c release, Bax and Bcl-2 protein levels, transcriptional levels of its molecules, and AIF translocation at 4 °C for 5 days. Activation of caspase-9, 8, 3 and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt-c) were observed during storage. The decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein levels, increased Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) expressions and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were major steps for inducing apoptosis. Collectively, transcriptional regulation of Fas ligand (FasL), Apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) indicated that extrinsic apoptotic pathways (FasL/caspase-8/caspase-3) and intrinsic pathway [(JNK and p38 MAPK)/(Bcl-2, Bax and Mcl-1)/cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9/caspase-3] were involved in apoptotic process. Mitochondrial AIF translocation to nuclear indicated that AIF mediated caspase-independent pathway. Therefore, transcriptional and translational alterations of multiple signaling molecules acted important roles in regulating apoptosis activation in postmortem process.

35869021	10.1016/j.clml.2022.06.011	Patterns of Utilization and Outcomes of Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 Rearrangements.	Patients with Diffuse Large Bcell Lymphoma (DLBCL) with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements [double-hit lymphoma/triple-hit lymphoma (DHL/THL)] have poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting. We utilized a real-world deidentified database of DLBCL patients and report patterns of therapy utilization in relapsed/refractory DLBCL. We used log-rank test to compare real-world overall survival (rwOS) among DHL and non-DHL subgroups for CAR Tcell therapy or ASCT respectively, stratified for prior lines of therapy. Of all 7,877 patients with DLBCL, 367 patients had DHL while 6113 had non-DHL. Second line chemotherapy was administered to 147 DHL patients and 1517 non-DHL. 1393 were excluded, including 934 with unknown DHL/THL status. Approximately 47% received salvage intent chemotherapy in the DHL subgroup, of which 19% patients eventually received ASCT, while 34% received salvage intent chemotherapy in the non-DHL/THL group with 32% receiving ASCT. DHL/THL status negatively influenced median rwOS for patients who underwent ASCT in the second-line while it was associated with numerically inferior but without statistically significant rwOS among patients that underwent CAR Tcell therapy on multivariable analysis. rwOS of relapsed DHL/THL is inferior to non-DHL/THL. Fewer patients with DHL/THL were able to proceed with ASCT after salvage chemotherapy compared to non-DHL/THL. ASCT as second-line therapy for relapsed DHL/THL had worse rwOS than for non-DHL/THL, consistent with the natural history of DHL/THL. This difference was not seen for CAR Tcell therapy, which combined with promising results from clinical trials, suggests a greater role for CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed/refractory DHL.	2022	07	22	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Bliven	Sean Patrick
35879400	10.1038/s41598-022-16943-4	Promising anti-leukemic effect of Zataria multiflora extract in combination with doxorubicin to combat acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Nalm-6) (in vitro and in silico).	One of the heterogeneous hematologic malignancies of the lymphocyte precursors is ALL. ALL has two incidence peaks that were determined in 2-5 years children and 60 years old adults. Cardiotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs is one of important side effects which may occur during or after chemotherapy period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ZME, Dox, and combinations on Nalm-6 cells. In this vein, the cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue and MTT assay. Evaluation of apoptosis was also analyzed by Annexin-V/PI staining. Moreover, the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, hTERT, c-Myc, P53, and P21 genes was detected by Real-Time PCR. Molecular docking as an in-silico method was performed for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins as well. Our achievements indicated that ZME had dose-dependent effect on Nalm-6 cells and ZME synergistically potentiated Dox effect. The expression of Bax, P53 and P21 genes increased although the expression of Bcl-2 genes decreased when cells treated with ZME/ Dox combination. Molecular docking showed the interactions of carvacrol and thymol in the active cavities of BCL2 and BCL-xl. Regarding to present study, ZME could be utilized as a combinatorial and potential drug for leukemic patients, which is under the treatment by Dox due to reducing the chemotherapy drug doses.	2022	07	27	Sci Rep	Lashkari	Mahla
35884496	10.3390/cancers14143434	Classifying Germinal Center Derived Lymphomas-Navigate a Complex Transcriptional Landscape.	Classification of lymphoid neoplasms is based mainly on histologic, immunologic, and (rarer) genetic features. It has been supplemented by gene expression profiling (GEP) in the last decade. Despite the considerable success, particularly in associating lymphoma subtypes with specific transcriptional programs and classifier signatures of up- or downregulated genes, competing molecular classifiers were often proposed in the literature by different groups for the same classification tasks to distinguish, e.g., BL versus DLBCL or different DLBCL subtypes. Moreover, rarer sub-entities such as MYC and BCL2 ""double hit lymphomas"" (DHL), IRF4-rearranged large cell lymphoma (IRF4-LCL), and Burkitt-like lymphomas with 11q aberration pattern (mnBLL-11q) attracted interest while their relatedness regarding the major classes is still unclear in many respects. We explored the transcriptional landscape of 873 lymphomas referring to a wide spectrum of subtypes by applying self-organizing maps (SOM) machine learning. The landscape reveals a continuum of transcriptional states activated in the different subtypes without clear-cut borderlines between them and preventing their unambiguous classification. These states show striking parallels with single cell gene expression of the active germinal center (GC), which is characterized by the cyclic progression of B-cells. The expression patterns along the GC trajectory are discriminative for distinguishing different lymphoma subtypes. We show that the rare subtypes take intermediate positions between BL, DLBCL, and FL as considered by the 5th edition of the WHO classification of haemato-lymphoid tumors in 2022. Classifier gene signatures extracted from these states as modules of coregulated genes are competitive with literature classifiers. They provide functional-defined classifiers with the option of consenting redundant classifiers from the literature. We discuss alternative classification schemes of different granularity and functional impact as possible avenues toward personalization and improved diagnostics of GC-derived lymphomas.	2022	07	31	Cancers (Basel)	Loeffler-Wirth	Henry
35885931	10.3390/genes13071144	Targeting a Novel G-Quadruplex in the <i>CARD11</i> Oncogene Promoter with Naptho(2,1-b)furan-1-ethanol,2-nitro- Requires the Nitro Group.	The aggressive nature of the activated B cell such as (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell (DLBCL) is frequently associated with altered B cell Receptor (BCR) signaling through the activation of key components including the scaffolding protein, <i>CARD11</i>. Most inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, target downstream BCR kinases with often modest and temporary responses for DLBCL patients. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy to target the BCR pathway by leveraging a novel DNA secondary structure to repress transcription. We discovered that a highly guanine (G)-rich element within the <i>CARD11</i> promoter forms a stable G-quadruplex (G4) using circular dichroism and polymerase stop biophysical techniques. We then identified a small molecule, naptho(2,1-b)furan-1-ethanol,2-nitro- (NSC373981), from a fluorescence-resonance energy transfer-based screen that stabilized <i>CARD11</i> G4 and inhibited <i>CARD11</i> transcription in DLBCL cells. In generating and testing analogs of NSC373981, we determined that the nitro group is likely essential for the downregulation of <i>CARD11</i> and interaction with <i>CARD11</i> G4, and the removal of the ethanol side chain enhanced this activity. Of note, the expression of <i>BCL2</i> and <i>MYC</i>, two other key oncogenes in DLBCL pathology with known promoter G4 structures, were often concurrently repressed with NSC373981 and the highly potent <b>R158</b> analog. Our findings highlight a novel approach to treat aggressive DLBCL by silencing <i>CARD11</i> gene expression that warrants further investigation.	2022	07	28	Genes (Basel)	Swafford	Kennith
35893891	10.3390/nu14153037	Shibi Tea (<i>Adinandra nitida</i>) and Camellianin A Alleviate CCl<sub>4</sub>-Induced Liver Injury in C57BL-6J Mice by Attenuation of Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Apoptosis.	Liver injury is a significant public health issue nowadays. Shibi tea is a non-<i>Camellia</i> tea prepared from the dried leaves of <i>Adinandra nitida</i>, one of the plants with the greatest flavonoid concentration, with Camellianin A (CA) being the major flavonoid. Shibi tea is extensively used in food and medicine and has been found to provide a variety of health advantages. The benefits of Shibi tea and CA in preventing liver injury have not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of extract of Shibi tea (EST) and CA in mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced acute liver injury. Two different concentrations of EST and CA were given to model mice by gavage for 3 days. Treatment with two concentrations of EST and CA reduced the CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced elevation of the liver index, liver histopathological injury score, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that EST and CA regulated the oxidative stress signaling pathway protein levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the expression of inflammatory cytokines, the phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (p-NF-κB)/nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-κB) ratio, the phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK), and the apoptosis-related protein levels of BCL2-associated X (Bax)/B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) in the liver. Taken together, EST and CA can protect against CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury by exerting antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis.	2022	07	28	Nutrients	Chen	Ruohong
35900563	10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_676_19	Signet ring cell lymphoma of follicular type with BCL2 gene rearrangement: A rare case with a short review of literature.	A case of signet ring cell lymphoma of presacral lymph node is reported. The patient was diagnosed as follicular lymphoma on the basis of clinical and laboratory features, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene rearrangement studies. Light microscopy examination showed neoplastic atypical cells with signet ring cell morphology in core biopsy of lymph node that stained for B-cell markers by IHC. In addition, the neoplastic cells expressed CD20, CD10, BCL-2, and BCL-6, indicating follicular center origin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization study demonstrated BCL2 gene arrangement. Especially in the case of deep-seated intra-abdominal lymph nodes with atypical presentation, the differential diagnosis arises with nonhemopoietic tumors, and this needs to be distinguished by specific immunostaining and gene arrangement studies.	2022	08	01	J Cancer Res Ther	Mishra	Pritinanda
35916333	10.1002/dc.25027	HHV8-negative primary effusion-based large B-cell lymphoma in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR::ABL1-positive under dasatinib treatment: Report of a new case and literature review.	Dasatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), used as treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR::ABL1-positive (CML), is complicated by pleural or pericardial effusions in about one-third of patients. Besides, in exceptional instances, effusion-based neoplastic B-cell lymphoproliferations have been described. Here, we report an HHV8-negative, EBV-positive large B-cell lymphoma presenting as a pericardial effusion in a patient with CML treated with dasatinib for 23 months, without associated tumor mass or lymphadenopathies. Large tumor cells showed a B-cell phenotype (CD20+, CD79+), with evidence of EBV infection (EBER-ISH+), but HHV8 (LANA-1) negative. Monoclonal IG gene rearrangements were identified. BCL2, BCL6, and MYC genes were not rearranged. Despite the aggressive cytomorphology the patient was in complete remission after 4 cycles of R-CHOP after 8 months follow-up. Four other cases of large B-cell effusion-based lymphomas developed in the setting of dasatinib therapy for CML have been reported in the literature. The four cases were HHV8-negative and one case was EBV-positive. Three of the four patients experienced a benign clinical course, which is in contrast to HHV8-positive primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). The mechanisms of development of these effusion-based B-cell lymphoproliferations in patients receiving TKI are not completely elucidated. Acute or relapsing effusions during TKI treatment in the setting of CML should be cytologically examined to exclude clonal B-cell lymphoproliferations.	2022	08	02	Diagn Cytopathol	Christe	Lucine
35916644	10.1097/QAI.0000000000003069	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma in the public-sector of Johannesburg, South Africa, in the era of widescale Anti-retroviral therapy use.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma with increased incidence among people living with HIV-infection (PLWH). Although it's frequency is reportedly attenuated by anti-retroviral therapy (ART), we have previously shown a similar rate of DLBCL in the post-ART era (2017) in Johannesburg, South Africa (SA) as compared to that seen when ART had only limited availability in the SA state-sector (2007). Here we present a more detailed analysis of DLBCL in the pre-and post-ART eras in Johannesburg. All cases of DLBCL diagnosed in the state-sector hospitals of Johannesburg in 2007 and 2017 were extracted from the laboratory information system, and factors of interest compared. The majority (&gt;85%) were seen among PLWH at both time-points; ART-coverage was significantly higher in 2017 as compared to 2007, but with failed immunological recovery in 50% of cases. The immunohistochemically-defined cell of origin differed according to HIV-status; the germinal center (GC) and non-GC subtypes predominating in the PLWH and the HIV-negative group, respectively. MYC-gene rearrangement was more common than is reported elsewhere (22.1%), while both BCL6 and BCL2 gene rearrangements were less so (14.6% and 0%, respectively). Slight improvement in survival was noted in the post-ART era, but remained poor, with bone marrow involvement and albumin levels ≤30g/L independently associated with mortality. While the frequency of DLBCL in Johannesburg has not dropped significantly in the post-ART era, a slight improvement in survival is seen. However, outcomes remain poor, indicating a need for further improvements in care.	2022	08	02	J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr	Vaughan	Jenifer
35919815	10.7150/ijms.73077	[6]-Gingerol induces Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Bladder Cancer cells via MAPK and ROS Signaling.	The anti-cancer effects of [6]-gingerol ([6]-GIN), the main active polyphenol of ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale</i>), were investigated in the human bladder cancer cell line 5637. [6]-GIN inhibited cell proliferation, increased sub‑G1 phase ratios, and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. [6]-GIN-induced cell death was associated with the downregulation of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‑2) and survivin and the upregulation of Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax). [6]-GIN activated caspase‑3 and caspase-9 and regulated the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Further, [6]-GIN also increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and TG100-115 or tranilast increased [6]-GIN‑induced cell death. These results suggest that [6]-GIN induced apoptosis in the bladder cancer cell line 5637 and therefore has the potential to be used in the development of new drugs for bladder cancer treatment.	2022	08	04	Int J Med Sci	Choi	Na Ri
35920412	10.1002/jbt.23185	Inhibiting AKT signaling pathway with cilostazol and meloxicam synergism for suppressing K562 cells in vitro.	Despite advances in cancer treatment, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is still one of the leading causes of death in the world. Due to the role of inflammation in cancer promotion and progression, thus use of anti-inflammatory agents may suppress cancer cell growth. In this study, we used two anti-inflammatory drugs, cilostazol and meloxicam, for the treatment of CML. Cell viability was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the synergism occurrence was calculated by compusyn software. Annexin V/PI test and Hoechst staining were used to determine the apoptosis rate. To determine the pathway of apoptosis induction, the expression of BCL2 Associated X (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) apoptotic genes and caspases activity were evaluated. The cell cycle was analyzed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were performed to estimate alterations in Ak strain transforming-1 (AKT-1), phosphprylated AKT-1 (p-AKT-1), adenosine mono-phosphate-kinase (AMPK), and phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) proteins and BCR/ABL and c-Myc distribution, respectively. Results showed that cilostazol, meloxicam, and their combination drug reduced cell viability (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with control, expression of Bax and Bcl-2 decreased in treated cells, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The caspase-9 activity increased in treated cells compared to control cells (p &lt; 0.001). The applied drugs decreased the protein level of p-AKT-1 while increasing the p-AMPK protein level (p &lt; 0.05). BCR/ABL and c-Myc Protein distribution significantly decreased in treated cells. In conclusion, the combination drug had more cytotoxic effects than cilostazol and meloxicam alone and induced apoptosis by inhibiting AKT-1 activation and c-Myc reduction. Therefore using combination drugs effectively can treat cancers of CML origin.	2022	08	03	J Biochem Mol Toxicol	Naderbar	Laya
35932211	10.1002/hon.3061	Distribution of lymphoma subtypes in Ukraine according to the WHO 2016 classification.	The Ukrainian Lymphoma Registry (ULR) was established in 2019 with the aim of monitoring the quality of diagnosis, staging, and treatment of lymphoma in Ukraine. Between September 2019 and October 2021, 546 patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma were prospectively registered. All cases were diagnosed according to the 2016 updated WHO lymphoma classification. The male-to-female ratio (M/F) for the whole population was 0.7, with a median age of 46 years (range 18-95). The adoption of the 2016 WHO classification resulted in the identification of 36 different lymphoma subtypes, with 132 cases (24.2%) classified differently compared to the 2008 WHO classification. Only 12 cases (2.8%) were true new entities, including seven cases of high-grade B-cell lymphoma NOS, three of anaplastic large B-cell lymphoma, ALK-negative, 1 case of HHV8+ DLBCL NOS, and 1 of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with C-MYC and BCL2/BCL6 rearrangement. Moreover, 55 (61.1%) entities, including 37 defined by WHO 2008 and 18 defined by WHO 2016, were not represented at all. The analysis of cases registered in the ULR provides a comprehensive breakdown of the subtypes, stage distribution, and treatment of malignant lymphomas (ML) in Ukraine, supporting the usefulness of prospective data collection and timely reporting. We believe that this study is the first step toward a better understanding of the real-life outcomes of patients with ML.	2022	08	19	Hematol Oncol	Kriachok	Iryna
35933930	10.1016/j.ctrv.2022.102443	Treatment strategies for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is nowadays a curable disease with the frontline treatment R-CHOP, but 30-40% of patients are still unresponsive or relapse thereafter. In the recent era several upcoming new options are improving the therapeutic landscape for relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL setting, first of all anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) that already represent a standard of care as third-line therapy and are rapidly moving as second-line treatment for those who are refractory or early relapse after R-CHOP. Among these new therapies, the combinations polatuzumab plus rituximab and bendamustine, tafasitamab plus lenalidomide for transplant ineligible patients, and CD3xCD20 bispecific antibodies are the most relevant, but several other agents and strategies are on the way. On the other hand, in the last 20 years, several efforts have been spent in the attempt to ameliorate the outcome over R-CHOP for the frontline treatment of DLBCL shortening the interval between the cycles or intensifying treatment or adding novel drugs to R-CHOP without success, so far. Recent studies combining the anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin plus R-CHP and the anti-BCL2 agent venetoclax plus R-CHOP showed promising results. Preliminary data of new upcoming strategies characterized by a tailored therapy based on different molecular subtypes of DLBCL are encouraging, showing a benefit over the standard R-CHOP. In this manuscript, the literature data on the landscape of new therapies available and upcoming for both frontline and R/R settings of DLBCL will be critically reviewed.	2022	09	13	Cancer Treat Rev	Poletto	Stefano
35936524	10.18502/ijph.v51i4.9251	The Effect of <i>B-Cell Lymphoma 2</i> and <i>BCL2-Associated X</i> Polymorphisms on the Survival of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients: Application of Frailty Survival Models.	<i>B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)</i> and <i>BCL-2 associated X (BAX)</i> polymorphisms are important in the apoptosis process, response to treatment and survival in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients. We aimed to investigate the effect of these genes with other predictors corresponding to the survival of ALL patients with an appropriate frailty survival model. Our study was performed in 2020 on sixty-two cases of childhood aged 3-16 (year) with ALL disease who were selected by convenience sampling from the two hospitals of Tabriz, Iran. RFLPPCR method was used for genotyping the promoter region of the <i>BAX</i> and <i>BCL-2</i> genes. We used different frailty survival models, to control heterogeneity between individuals due to unmeasured factors affecting their survival. All analyses were implemented using Stata 16. Based on the result of log-logistic model along with frailty gamma, the proportional odds (standard error) of survival for a CC allele of <i>BCL-2</i> patient compared to a AA allele patient were 6.0 (1.47); <i>P</i>&lt;0.001 and for a AC of <i>BCL-2</i> allele patient were 0.57 (1.23); <i>P</i>=0.009. Patients with AG allele of <i>BAX</i> had 2.05 (1.26) times greater odds of surviving than a AA allele patient (<i>P</i>=0.003). The odds of survival of patients with abnormal white blood cell (WBC) were 92% less than normal WBC (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). With controlling unmeasured factors affecting, the <i>BCL-2</i> and <i>BAX</i> genes promoter polymorphism are effective in the survival rates for ALL.	2022	08	09	Iran J Public Health	Nikmohammadi	Navideh
35952327	10.1200/JCO.22.00597	Smart Start: Rituximab, Lenalidomide, and Ibrutinib in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Chemoimmunotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is largely unchanged for decades. Both preclinical models and clinical data suggest the combination of lenalidomide and ibrutinib may have synergy in DLBCL, particularly in the non-germinal center B-cell-like subset. We enrolled 60 patients with newly diagnosed non-germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL in this investigator-initiated, single-arm phase II trial of rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib (RLI) with the sequential addition of chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02636322). Patients were treated with rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous once on day 1, lenalidomide 25 mg once per day on days 1-10, and ibrutinib 560 mg once daily continuously of each 21-day cycle (RLI). After two cycles, standard chemotherapy was added to RLI for six additional cycles. The primary end points were overall response rate (ORR) after two cycles of RLI alone and complete response rate after completion of RLI with chemotherapy. In evaluable samples, circulating tumor DNA and DLBCL90 assays were performed. The median age was 63.5 years (range: 29-83 years) with 28% age 70 years or older. The revised international prognostic index identified 42% as high risk, and 62% were double expressor of MYC and BCL2 protein. The ORR after two cycles of RLI was 86.2%, and the complete response rate at the end of RLI-chemotherapy was 94.5%. With a median follow-up of 31 months, the progression-free survival and overall survival were at 91.3% and 96.6% at 2 years, respectively. Smart Start is the first study, to our knowledge, to treat newly diagnosed DLBCL with a targeted therapy combination before chemotherapy. RLI produced a high ORR, and RLI with chemotherapy resulted in durable responses. This establishes the potential for developing biologically driven and noncytotoxic first-line therapies for DLBCL.	2022	08	11	J Clin Oncol	Westin	Jason
35953760	10.1631/jzus.B2200016	HDAC inhibitor chidamide synergizes with venetoclax to inhibit the growth of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma via down-regulation of MYC, BCL2, and TP53 expression.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A total of 10%‒15% of DLBCL cases are associated with myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog(<i>MYC</i>) and/or B-cell lymphoma-2 (<i>BCL2</i>) translocation or amplification. BCL2 inhibitors have potent anti-tumor effects in DLBCL; however, resistance can be acquired through up-regulation of alternative anti-apoptotic proteins. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor chidamide can induce BIM expression, leading to apoptosis of lymphoma cells with good efficacy in refractory recurrent DLBCL. In this study, the synergistic mechanism of chidamide and venetoclax in DLBCL was determined through in vitro and in vivo models. We found that combination therapy significantly reduced the protein levels of MYC, TP53, and BCL2 in activated apoptotic-related pathways in DLBCL cells by increasing BIM levels and inducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, combination therapy regulated expression of multiple transcriptomes in DLBCL cells, involving apoptosis, cell cycle, phosphorylation, and other biological processes, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in DLBCL-bearing xenograft mice. Taken together, these findings verify the in vivo therapeutic potential of chidamide and venetoclax combination therapy in DLBCL, warranting pre-clinical trials for patients with DLBCL.	2022	08	15	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Luo	Cancan
35955467	10.3390/ijms23158334	Synovial Fluid Regulates the Gene Expression of a Pattern of microRNA via the NF-κB Pathway: An In Vitro Study on Human Osteoarthritic Chondrocytes.	Synovial fluid (SF) represents the primary source of nutrients of articular cartilage and is implicated in maintaining cartilage metabolism. We investigated the effects of SF, from patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and controls, on a pattern of microRNA (miRNA) in human OA chondrocytes. Cells were stimulated with 50% or 100% SF for 24 h and 48 h. Apoptosis and superoxide anion production were detected by cytometry; miRNA (34a, 146a, 155, 181a), cytokines, metalloproteinases (MMPs), type II collagen (Col2a1), antioxidant enzymes, B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2, and nuclear factor (NF)-κB by real-time PCR. The implication of the NF-κB pathway was assessed by the use of NF-κB inhibitor (BAY-11-7082). RA and OA SF up-regulated miR-34a, -146a, -155, -181a, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, MMP-1, MMP-13, and ADAMTs-5 gene expression, while it down-regulated Col2a1. Pathological SF also induced apoptosis, reduced viability, and decreased BCL2 mRNA, whereas it increased superoxide anions, the expression of antioxidant enzymes, p65 and p50 NF-κB. Opposite and positive results were obtained with 100% control SF. Pre-incubation with BAY-11-7082 counteracted SF effects on miRNA. We highlight the role of the SF microenvironment in regulating some miRNA involved in inflammation and cartilage degradation during OA and RA, via the NF-κB pathway.	2022	08	15	Int J Mol Sci	Cheleschi	Sara
35962819	10.1007/s00280-022-04460-0	Safe administration and pharmacokinetic monitoring of crushed venetoclax tablets with posaconazole and clarithromycin via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.	Leukemic stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) express high B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) levels, which contribute to leukemic cell survival and resistance to therapy. Venetoclax-a BCL-2 inhibitor-is indicated for the treatment of AML, which may also target leukemic stem cells; however, it is only available as a tablet. There are no reports of venetoclax use in patients who cannot take oral drugs; therefore, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of venetoclax administered through a gastrostomy tube is unknown. We report, for the first time, a case of relapsed Japanese AML patient treated with crushed venetoclax tablets through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube because of esophageal stricture due to complications of stem cell transplantation. The patient was also taking posaconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly. We evaluated the plasma concentrations of venetoclax administered through a PEG tube. Time to maximum concentration, maximum plasma concentration, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were similar to the previously reported PK parameters after oral administration of intact venetoclax tablets in Japanese patients with AML. The clinical course passed safely without the occurrence of unexpected adverse events during the administration of crushed venetoclax tablets in combination with azacitidine. The PK parameters of the crushed administered venetoclax via PEG tube was similar to the previously reported PK parameters of the orally administered venetoclax. Therefore, administration of crushed venetoclax tablets through a PEG tube could be an alternate route for patients who have difficulty with oral administration.	2022	08	26	Cancer Chemother Pharmacol	Sato	Honami

The relevant literature was reviewed. <b>Results:</b> ①The study sample included three males and three females with a median age of 33 years. Three tumors were in the tonsils, two in the lymphoid nodes, and one in the dorsal lump. All patients were treated using the RCDOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, liposomal doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) regimen. All of them were alive at the time of follow-up in November 2021. ②Microscopic examination showed an entirely follicular pattern in one case and an entirely diffused pattern in 5 cases. The tumor cells were medium to large, and most of the lesions were dilatative with brisk mitotic activity (<i>n</i>=five cases) and no starry sky pattern (<i>n</i>=6 cases) . ③Four cases exhibited a GCB phenotype, and the other two exhibited a non-GCB phenotype. All of the cases were positive for CD20, PAX-5, MUM, and BCL6, and negative for CD5. Moreover, CD10, BCL2, and c-MYC were positive in 4, 3, and 2 cases, respectively.④IRF4 gene rearrangement was identified in all cases, BCL6 gene rearrangement was detected in 5 cases, and 2 cases were positive. BCL2 and MYC gene rearrangement were performed in 5 cases, all negative. ⑤Three paraffin tissue samples were used for next-generation sequencing, and lymphoma-related gene mutations such as IRF4, TP53, IGLL5, and MYD88 were detected in 3 cases. <b>Conclusions:</b> LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement is a rare entity with unique clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics. This entity's pathogenesis, treatment options, and long-term prognosis still need to be explored further. <b>目的：</b> 探讨伴1RF4重排的大B细胞淋巴瘤的临床、病理学、遗传学特征。 <b>方法：</b> 收集中国医学科学院血液病医院淋巴瘤诊疗中心2017年12月至2021年10月收治的6例伴1RF4重排的大B细胞淋巴瘤患者的临床资料，包括病理学、荧光原位杂交、二代基因测序检测，并复习相关文献。 <b>结果：</b> ①6例患者中男3例，女3例，中位发病年龄33岁。6例患者中3例起病部位为扁桃体，2例为淋巴结，1例为背部肿物。6例患者均采取了RCDOP（利妥昔单抗、环磷酰胺、脂质体阿霉素、长春新碱、泼尼松）方案治疗，随访至2021年11月，6例患者全部存活。②形态学：5例为弥漫性生长，1例为滤泡性生长，瘤细胞体积均为中等至大，病灶多呈膨胀性生长，5例核分裂象易见，6例均未见""星空现象""。③免疫组化：4例为生发中心B细胞（GCB）型，2例为non-GCB型；6例均为CD20、PAX5、MUM1、BCL6阳性，CD5阴性；4例CD10阴性；3例BCL2阳性，2例c-MYC阳性。④荧光原位杂交：6例患者IRF4分离探针检测均呈阳性；5例进行BCL6基因重排检测，2例重排阳性；各有5例进行了BCL2、MYC基因重排检测，均为阴性。⑤二代测序：3例患者应用石蜡组织标本进行了二代测序，可见IRF4、TP53、IGLL5、MYD88等淋巴瘤相关基因突变。 <b>结论：</b> 伴IRF4重排的大B细胞淋巴瘤是一种具有独特临床、病理学、遗传学特征的罕见的大B细胞淋巴瘤。对该类型淋巴瘤的发病机制、治疗选择、长期预后仍需进一步探索。.	2022	08	16	Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Yu	Y
35970756	10.1016/j.clml.2022.07.013	Mechanisms of Resistance to BCL2 Inhibitor Therapy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and Potential Future Therapeutic Directions.	Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) constitutively overexpresses B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) with consequent dysregulation of intrinsic apoptosis leading to abnormal cellular survival. Therapeutic use of BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i, eg, venetoclax) in CLL, as both continuous monotherapy or in fixed duration combination, has translated scientific rationale into clinical benefit with significant rates of complete responses, including those without detectable minimal residual disease. Unlike with chemotherapy, response rates to venetoclax do not appear to be influenced by pre-existing chromosomal abnormalities or somatic mutations present, although the duration of response observed remains shorter for those with traditional higher risk genetic aberrations. This review seeks to describe both the disease factors that influence primary venetoclax sensitivity/resistance and those resistance mechanisms that may be acquired secondary to BCL2i therapy in CLL. Baseline venetoclax-sensitivity or -resistance is influenced by the expression of BCL2 relative to other BCL2 family member proteins, microenvironmental factors including nodal T-cell stimulation, and tumoral heterogeneity. With selection pressure applied by continuous venetoclax exposure, secondary resistance mechanisms develop in oligoclonal fashion. Those mechanisms described include acquisition of BCL2 variants, dynamic aberrations of alternative BCL2 family proteins, and mutations affecting both BAX and other BH3 proteins. In view of the resistance described, this review also proposes future applications of BCL2i therapy in CLL and potential means by which BCL2i-resistance may be abrogated.	2022	08	15	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Bennett	Rory
35974958	10.1097/HS9.0000000000000767	Molecular Cytogenetic Profiling Reveals Similarities and Differences Between Localized Nodal and Systemic Follicular Lymphomas.	Recently, we have developed novel highly promising gene expression (GE) classifiers discriminating localized nodal (LFL) from systemic follicular lymphoma (SFL) with prognostic impact. However, few data are available in LFL especially concerning hotspot genetic alterations that are associated with the pathogenesis and prognosis of SFL. A total of 144 LFL and 527 SFL, enrolled in prospective clinical trials of the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group, were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect deletions in chromosomes 1p, 6q, and 17p as well as <i>BCL2</i> translocations to determine their impact on clinical outcome of LFL patients. The frequency of chromosomal deletions in 1p and 17p was comparable between LFL and SFL, while 6q deletions and <i>BCL2</i> translocations more frequently occurred in SFL. A higher proportion of 1p deletions was seen in <i>BCL2</i>-translocation-positive LFL, compared with <i>BCL2</i>-translocation-negative LFL. Deletions in chromosomes 1p, 6q, and 17p predicted clinical outcome of patients with SFL in the entire cohort, while only deletions in chromosome 1p retained its negative prognostic impact in R-CHOP-treated SFL. In contrast, no deletions in one of the investigated genetic loci predicted clinical outcome in LFL. Likewise, the presence or absence of <i>BCL2</i> translocations had no prognostic impact in LFL. Despite representing a genetic portfolio closely resembling SFL, LFL showed some differences in deletion frequencies. <i>BCL2</i> translocation and 6q deletion frequency differs between LFL and SFL and might contribute to distinct genetic profiles in LFL and SFL.	2022	08	18	Hemasphere	Horn	Heike
35979721	10.3324/haematol.2022.280631	Selective inhibition of MCL1 overcomes venetoclax-resistance in a murine model of myelodysplastic syndromes.	Treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains insufficient due to clonal heterogeneity and lack of effective clinical therapies. Dysregulation of apoptosis is observed across MDS subtypes regardless of mutations and represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity. Venetoclax (VEN), a selective inhibitor of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), has yielded impressive responses in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high risk MDS. BCL2 family anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL and induced myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) are implicated in leukemia survival, and upregulation of MCL1 is seen in VEN-resistant AML and MDS. We determined in vitro sensitivity of MDS patient samples to selective inhibitors of BCL2, BCL-XL and MCL1. While VEN response positively correlated with MDS with excess blasts, all MDS subtypes responded to MCL1 inhibition. Treatment with combined VEN+MCL1 inhibtion was synergistic in all MDS subtypes without significant injury to normal hematopoiesis and reduced MDS engraftment in MISTRG6 mice, supporting the pursuit of clinical trials with combined BCL2+MCL1 inhibition in MDS.	2022	08	18	Haematologica	Fischer	Melissa A
35982976	10.3389/fonc.2022.934008	Exploring the current molecular landscape and management of multiple myeloma patients with the t(11;14) translocation.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically complex disease. The key myeloma-initiating genetic events are hyperdiploidy and translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer on chromosome 14, which leads to the activation of oncogenes (e.g., CCND1, CCND3, MAF, and MMSET). The t(11;14) translocation is the most common in MM (15%-20%) and results in cyclin D1 (CCND1) upregulation, which leads to kinase activation and tumor cell proliferation. Notably, t(11;14) occurs at a higher rate in patients with plasma cell leukemia (40%) and light chain amyloidosis (50%). Patients with myeloma who harbor the t(11;14) translocation have high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Multiple studies demonstrated that the presence of t(11;14) was predictive of BCL2 dependency, suggesting that BCL2 could be a target in this subtype of myeloma. Venetoclax, an oral BCL2 inhibitor, has shown remarkable activity in treating relapsed/refractory MM patients with t(11;14) and BCL2 overexpression, either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-myeloma agents. In this review, we describe the molecular defects associated with the t(11;14), bring into question the standard cytogenetic risk of myeloma patients harboring t(11;14), summarize current efficacy and safety data of targeted venetoclax-based therapies, and discuss the future of individualized or precision medicine for this unique myeloma subgroup, which will guide optimal treatment.	2022	08	20	Front Oncol	Diamantidis	Michael D
35983732	10.1080/10428194.2022.2098291	Utility of measurable residual disease for predicting treatment outcomes with BCR- and BCL2-Targeted therapies in patients with CLL.	Inhibitors targeting B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway proteins and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are recommended in the first-line and relapsed/refractory disease settings. Measurable residual disease (MRD) is an important prognostic tool in patients treated with the BCL2-targeted agent, venetoclax. We explored the relationship between MRD status and progression-free (PFS)/overall survival (OS) in patients with CLL, following treatment with novel BCR- and BCL2-targeted agents. Compared with chemoimmunotherapy, higher rates of undetectable (u)MRD were achieved with BCL2-targeted therapies; achieving uMRD status was associated with longer PFS and OS than MRD-positivity. Continuous treatment with BCR-targeted agents did not achieve uMRD status in many patients, and outcomes were not correlated with uMRD status. Future clinical trials of targeted treatment combinations could be designed to demonstrate uMRD as a treatment objective, and allow a response-driven, personalized strategy to optimize treatment and improve OS outcomes.	2022	08	19	Leuk Lymphoma	Wierda	William G
36001789	10.46883/2022.25920970	Current Treatment of Burkitt Lymphoma and High-Grade B-Cell Lymphomas.	This article reviews the current data and future directions in the management of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL). BL is a rare, mature B-cell lymphoma molecularly defined by translocation of the proto-oncogene MYC. Multiple intensive combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens have demonstrated excellent efficacy in this disease, although treatment toxicity remains a challenge in many patients. Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) represents HGBL with translocations of the oncogene MYC along with either BCL2 or BCL6, or both. In 2016, the World Health Organization update of this classification was revised to a new entity defined by cytogenetics: HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. Recent prospective data using dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab has demonstrated encouraging treatment efficacy in these patients. HGBL, not otherwise specified (NOS) is a heterogeneous, aggressive, mature B-cell lymphoma that does not meet criteria for BL, DHL, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma NOS. Therapy for this entity is not well established. The aggressive B-cell lymphomas BL, DHL, and HGBL, NOS are unique diseases with specific pathogenesis and biology. Insights into the molecular biology of these diseases have enabled new classifications and personalization of therapy.	2022	08	26	Oncology (Williston Park)	Johnson	P Connor
36014833	10.3390/nu14163327	The Protective Effect of α-Lipoic Acid against Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs)-Mediated Liver Damage Is Associated with Upregulating Nrf2 and Suppressing NF-κB.	This study examined if regulating the keap-1? Nrf2 antioxidant pathway mediated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) induced liver damage, and examined the protective effect of co-supplement of α-lipoic acid (α-LA). Rats were separated into 4 groups (n = 8/each) as control, α-LA (200 mg/kg), AuNPs (5 µg/2.85 × 10<sup>11</sup>), and AuNPs (5 µg/2.85 × 10<sup>11</sup>) + α-LA (200 mg/kg). After 7 days, AuNPs induced severe degeneration in the livers of rats with the appearance of some fatty changes. In addition, it increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (ɣ-GTT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as liver levels of malondialdehyde (MDA). Concomitantly, AuNPs significantly depleted hepatic levels of total glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) but increased hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). It also reduced mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) but significantly increased those of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, as well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl2. In addition, AuNPs enhanced the total and nuclear levels of NF-κB p65 but reduced the mRNA and total and nuclear protein levels of Nrf2. Of note, AuNPs did not affect the mRNA levels of keap-1. All these events were reversed by α-LA in the AuNPs-treated rats. In conclusion, α-LA attenuated AuNPs-mediated liver damage in rats by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation, effects that are associated with upregulation/activation of Nrf2.	2022	08	29	Nutrients	Alshammari	Ghedeir M
36029292	10.1111/bcpt.13788	The therapeutic effects of cycloastragenol in ulcerative colitis by modulating SphK/MIP-1α/miR-143 signalling.	Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) experience diarrhoea, hematochezia and abdominal pain. UC is a well-known health challenge affecting 200-250 per 100 000 individuals worldwide, with a similar prevalence in both sexes and elevated upon activation of gut immune responses. We evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of cycloastragenol in experimentally induced UC rats and examined the modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α and miR-143. We treated UC rats with 30 mg/kg cycloastragenol and assessed gene and protein expression levels of SphK, MIP-1α, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2-associated X (BAX), miR-143, NF-κB, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and active caspase-3. Colon sections were examined using electron microscopy; additional sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin or immunostained with anti-TNF-α and anti-caspase-3 antibodies. Electron microscopy of UC specimens revealed dark distorted goblet cell nuclei with disarranged mucus granules and a nondistinct brush border with atypical microvilli. Haematoxylin-eosin staining showed damaged intestinal glands, severe haemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration. Cycloastragenol treatment improved the induced morphological changes. In UC rats, cycloastragenol significantly reduced expression levels of SphK, MIP-1α, BAX, NF-κB, TNF-α and active caspase-3, associated with BCL2 and miR-143 overexpression. Therefore, cycloastragenol protects against UC by modulating SphK/MIP-1α/miR-143, subsequently deactivating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.	2022	09	06	Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol	Bagalagel	Alaa
36035812	10.1016/j.jobcr.2022.07.009	Expression and bioinformatics analyses show HSP70 complements BCL2 action in oral carcinogenesis.	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a major form of oral malignant tumors (oral cancer) with less than 50% five year survival rate. Its pathogenesis involves dysregulation in apoptosis. Early dysregulation at molecular level could not be correlated with clinical presentations because of complex interactions at molecular levels. HSP70 (Heat shock Protein 70) and BCL2 (B cell lymphoma 2) are known molecular players in oncogenesis. However, their interaction is not known till date. Expression analyses of BCL2 and HSP70 was done through Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Bioinformatic tools using blood samples from 41 OSCC, 35 Oral Potentially Premalignant Disorders (OPMD) and 4 controls in BCL2 study and 48 OSCC and 32 OPMD cases in HSP70 study. Bioinformatic software showed experimentally determined interaction value of 0.32 amongst the two, predicting similarity in molecular functions or pathways between the two, which was confirmed by ELISA. Our data showed that first HSP70 boosts BCL2 while in later stages of oncogenesis BCL2 consumes HSP70. Both molecules interact at several steps by complementing and supplementing each other. Because of this complex interaction various anti BCL2 therapies have not achieved desired results till date.	2022	08	30	J Oral Biol Craniofac Res	Singh	Geeta
36048893	10.1093/ajcp/aqac104	Systemic Presentation of Somatic TET2 Mutated B-Cell Lymphoma in a Child With Kabuki Syndrome and a Germline KMT2D Variant.	Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital malformation syndrome associated with germline KMT2D mutations. Recurrent somatic mutations in KMT2D have frequently been observed in B-cell lymphoma, but limited studies are available that evaluate the genetic landscape of B-cell lymphomas in the setting of KS. We describe a unique case of B-cell lymphoma that illustrates histologic features of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma (FL) in a young patient with KS and autoimmune disease who showed a systemic presentation of widespread lymphadenopathy and clonal lymphocytosis. We present the first reported case of a young patient with KS harboring a germline KMT2D variant and presenting with a systemic CD10-positive, BCL2-negative B-cell lymphoma of follicle center origin illustrating histologic features of pediatric-type FL. Targeted next-generation sequencing of the B-cell lymphoma showed somatic TET2 and subclonal CXCR4 variants. These findings suggest that abnormal epigenetic regulation caused by alterations in KMT2D and TET2 may have played critical roles in promoting lymphomagenesis in this patient. This unique case presentation highlights the importance of close clinical monitoring and the value of clinical context in the diagnosis of pediatric FL-like lesions in patients with KS.	2022	09	01	Am J Clin Pathol	Kumar	Jyoti
36051027	10.1002/jha2.489	Inactivating <i>BTK</i> mutations in large B-cell lymphoma in a real-world cohort: Strong correlation with <i>BCL2</i> translocation.	Inactivating mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (<i>BTK</i>) in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) have recently been reported. These mutations were found in BTK inhibitor-treatment naïve patients. Here, we report the <i>BTK</i> mutation status in a real-world cohort of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We found primary <i>BTK</i> mutations in 7.7% of patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) and in 14.1% of patients with FL. All patients with <i>BTK</i>-mutated LBCL were <i>BCL2</i> translocation positive, and the correlation between <i>BCL2</i> translocation and <i>BTK</i> mutation persisted even when patients with known transformation from FL were excluded.	2022	09	03	EJHaem	Schejbel	Lone

36051055	10.1002/jha2.457	An integrated prognostic model for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtype, is characterized by strong biological, morphological, and clinical heterogeneity, but patients are treated with immunochemotherapy in a relatively homogeneous way. Here, we have used a customized NanoString platform to analyze a series of 197 homogeneously treated DLBCL cases. The platform includes the most relevant genes or signatures known to be useful for predicting response to R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone) in DLBCL cases. We generated a risk score that combines the International Prognostic Index with cell of origin and double expression of <i>MYC/BCL2</i>, and stratified the series into three groups, yielding hazard ratios from 0.15 to 5.49 for overall survival, and from 0.17 to 5.04 for progression-free survival. Group differences were highly significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and the scoring system was applicable to younger patients (&lt;60 years of age) and patients with advanced or localized stages of the disease. Results were validated in an independent dataset from 166 DLBCL patients treated in two distinct clinical trials. This risk score combines clinical and biological data in a model that can be used to integrate biological variables into the prognostic models for DLBCL cases.	2022	09	03	EJHaem	Rodríguez	Marta
36054886	10.1097/SCS.0000000000008519	Influence of Experimental Skull Defects on Brain.	This study was aimed to observe the effects of skull defects on the brain in rats and further to investigate its underlying pathophysiological. Three different sizes of skull were removed in rats to produce models of skull defect, and then the behavioral changes were detected using a grip strength meter and neurobehavioral severity scale scores. The authors further examined the levels of cell apoptosis and autophagy, the cerebral blood flow with immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence micro-ultrasound system, respectively. The authors found that the sensory function but not the grip was impaired on the 6th day after a 5 × 10 mm defect while the motor function was on the 2nd day. In addition, the authors found an increment in B-cell lymphoma-2/BCL2-Associated X (Bcl2/Bax) and LC3 II/I expression, a maker of apoptosis and autophagy, respectively, in the defective hemisphere especially at the edge of the defective area. Importantly, the blood flow of internal carotid artery began to decline at 2 hours, and reached minimum on the 4th day, but began to recover on the 6th day in the hemi-defect group. In conclusion, a larger skull defect could impair the cognitive function but not the motor function and its underlying pathophysiology were mainly related to a decrease in cerebral flow.	2022	09	07	J Craniofac Surg	Bin	Peng
36056803	10.1111/and.14579	Asprosin promotes steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis with improved glucose metabolism in adult mice testis.	Asprosin is an orexigenic adipokine that regulates appetite and glucose homeostasis in mammals. To date, only fragmentary findings are reported regarding its role in testicular activities. In the current investigation, immunolocalization and direct action of asprosin in adult mice testis was evaluated. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot studies were performed to analyse the testicular expression of asprosin. Intratesticular treatment of asprosin (0.1 μg and 1.0 μg per testis) was given to evaluate its direct action on testicular functions. Sertoli and Leydig cells were found to be immuno-positive for asprosin. Intratesticular administration of asprosin resulted into a significant increase in glucose and lactate levels along with enhanced expression of asprosin receptor OLFR734, insulin receptor (IR), glucose transporter 8 (GLUT 8), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and monocorboxylate transporters (MCT2 and 4). In addition, asprosin administration increased the testicular expression of cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen: PCNA), cell survival (B cell lymphoma 2: Bcl2) and decreased germ cell apoptosis (Cysteine aspartic acid protease 3: Caspase 3) leading to increased sperm counts. Further, asprosin treatment resulted into increased level of total cholesterol, testosterone and steroidogenic markers (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein: StAR; 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases: 3β HSD and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases: 17β HSD). Asprosin treatment promotes testicular glucose uptake and lactate synthesis to provide energy for steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. The significant correlation between the asprosin-induced increased IR expression and increased testosterone, glucose and lactate levels suggests its role in increased survival and proliferation but decrease in germ cell apoptosis. This study proposed asprosin's role as an autocrine/paracrine regulator of testicular functions in adult mice.	2022	09	03	Andrologia	Maurya	Sangeeta
36057749	10.1007/s00428-022-03404-6	Diagnostic approaches and future directions in Burkitt lymphoma and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.	Since the 2016 WHO update, progress has been made in understanding the biology of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and the concept of high-grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBCL) that allows some degree of refinement. The summary presented here reviews in detail the discussions of the Clinical Advisory Committee and expands upon the newly published 2022 International Consensus Classification for lymphoid malignancies (Campo et al. Blood, 2022). BL remains the prototypic HGBCL and diagnostic criteria are largely unchanged. HGBCL with MYC and BCL2 and HGBCL with MYC and BCL6 rearrangements are now separated to reflect biologic and pathologic differences. HGBCL, NOS remains a diagnosis of exclusion that should be used only in rare cases. FISH strategies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and HGBCL are discussed in detail for these diseases. Advances in integrative analysis of mutations, structural abnormalities, copy number, and gene expression signatures allow a more nuanced view of the heterogeneity of DLBCL, NOS as well as definitions of HGBCL and point to where the future may be headed for classification of these diseases.	2022	09	03	Virchows Arch	King	Rebecca L
36062172	10.1155/2022/1932777	Ethyl Acetate Fraction of <i>Hedyotis diffusa Willd</i> Induces Apoptosis via JNK/Nur77 Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by poor diagnosis and high mortality. Novel and efficient therapeutic agents are urgently needed for the treatment. <i>Hedyotis diffusa Willd</i> (HDW) is used to treat cancers, especially HCC in China. The study aimed to identify the main anti-HCC extract in HDW and to explore the mechanism of the active extract. The high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS) method was used for the simultaneous determination of main compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction of HDW (EHDW). The toxicity test of different HDW fractions was carried out on larvae at 2 day-post-fertilization (dpf) for 72 h. The in vivo anti-HCC effect of different HDW fractions was evaluated on a zebrafish tumor model by immersion administration. The antiproliferative effect of HDW fractions was determined with MTT assay, as well as hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining assay. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to observe changes in nucleus morphology. Flow cytometry analysis was used to investigate apoptosis induction. Western blot analysis was used to examine apoptosis-related proteins, and key proteins in JNK/Nur77 signaling pathway. SP600125 was served to validate the apoptotic mechanism. EHDW showed the strongest tumor cell growth inhibitory effect on zebrafish tumor model. Further study revealed that EHDW induced apoptosis in zebrafish tumor model and in cultured Hep3B cells. Meanwhile, it has been shown that the levels of BCL2-associated X (Bax), cytochrome c (cyto c), cleaved-caspase 3, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cells were upregulated. In contrast, the level of antiapoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) was downregulated in Hep3B cells. Additionally, EHDW activated JNK/Nur77 pathway by increasing the levels of p-JNK<sup>(Thr183/Tyr185)</sup> and p-Nur77<sup>(Ser351)</sup>. Further study showed that blockage of JNK by SP600125 reversed EHDW-induced JNK/Nur77 pathway and the downstream apoptotic proteins. In conclusion, EHDW exerted the anti-HCC effect, which may be attributed to the activation of JNK/Nur77 pathway. This study supported the rationale of HDW as an HCC therapeutic agent.	2022	09	06	Evid Based Complement Alternat Med	Ning	Weimin
36081566	10.3389/fonc.2022.941347	Molecular subtyping of CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma based on DNA-targeted sequencing and Lymph2Cx.	CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (CD5+ DLBCL) showed poor prognosis in the rituximab era, with limited research on its genetic characteristics and cell of origin (COO). We aimed to demonstrate the molecular characteristics of CD5+ DLBCL and to discover potential prognostic factors. We included 24 cases of CD5+ DLBCL and 23 CD5-negative (CD5-) counterparts and collected their clinicopathological features. Targeted DNA sequencing of 475 lymphoma-related genes was performed, and all cases were assigned to distinct genetic subtypes using the LymphGen tool. The COO was determined by the Lymph2Cx assay. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were applied to identify the possible prognostic factors. Compared with their CD5- counterparts, patients with CD5+ DLBCL tended to have a worse prognosis and a higher incidence of MYD88L265P and CD79B double mutation (MCD) subtype (54.17%, P = 0.005) and activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype (62.5%, P = 00017), as determined by next-generation sequencing and Lymph2Cx, respectively. Moreover, PIM1, MYD88, and KMT2D mutations were detected more frequently in CD5+ DLBCL cases (P &lt; 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, MYC/BCL2 double expression and ABC subtype were correlated with unfavorable overall survival (OS). High mRNA expression of SERPINA9 and MME showed a significant correlation with a better OS, and high expression of MME showed a significant correlation with better progression-free survival in CD5+ DLBCL. The genetic profile of CD5+ DLBCL is characterized by PIM1, MYD88, and KMT2D mutations, with a higher incidence of MCD and ABC subtypes. MYC/BCL2 double expression, ABC subtype, and mRNA expression of SERPINA9 and MME are independently predictive of the prognosis of CD5+ DLBCL.	2022	09	10	Front Oncol	Ma	Dongshen
36082710		[Homocysteine induces glomerular podocyte apoptosis via up-regulation of miR-488-3p expression in MPC-5 mice].	Objective To explore the role of microRNA-488-3p (miR-488-3p) in podocytes apoptosis induced by homocysteine (Hcy). Methods Flow cytometry was employed to analyze the ratio of podocytes apoptosis after treated with 0 μmol/L Hcy (control group) or 80 μmol/L Hcy (Hcy group) for 48 hours. The expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-related X protein (BAX), and caspase-3 were measured by Western blot analysis in podocytes, after cells were treated with 80 μmol/L Hcy (Hcy group) for 48 hours, and the expression of miR-488-3p was detected by real-time PCR. The transfection and apoptosis ratio of podocytes were also detected after cells were transfected with miR-488-3p inhibitor. Results The apoptosis rate of podocytes increased in cells treated with Hcy, compared with control group. The expression levels of BAX and caspase-3 increased significantly in Hcy group, while Bcl2 expression was suppressed by Hcy. Furthermore, the expression of miR-488-3p increased in Hcy-induced podocyte. On the contrary, podocyte showed an decreased apoptosis rate, expression levels of BAX and caspase-3 decreased after cells were transfected with miR-488-3p inhibitor. However, Bcl2, which was not in this line, showed an increase when the cells transfected with miR-488-3p inhibitor. Conclusion Hcy promotes apoptosis of podocyte by up-regulating the expression of miR-488-3p.	2022	09	12	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Jie	Yuzhen
36092159	10.1155/2022/3737137	Ginsenoside Rg1 Ameliorates Acute Renal Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Upregulating AMPK<i>α</i>1 Expression.	Acute renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury often occurs during kidney transplantation and other kidney surgeries, and the molecular mechanism involves oxidative stress. We hypothesized that ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), a saponin derived from ginseng, would protect the renal tissue against acute renal I/R injury by upregulating 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase <i>α</i>1 (AMPK<i>α</i>1) expression and inhibiting oxidative stress. The models of acute anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) damage in normal rat kidney epithelial cell lines (NRK-52E) and acute renal I/R injury in mice were constructed. The results revealed that pretreatment with 25 <i>μ</i>M Rg1 significantly increased NRK-52E viability, decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and apoptosis, suppressed reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress, stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced mitochondria permeability transition pore openness, decreased adenosine monophosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio, and upregulated the expression of AMPK<i>α</i>1, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 2, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8, and B-cell lymphoma 2, while downregulating BCL2-associated X protein expression. The effects of Rg1 pretreatment were similar to those of pAD/Flag-AMPK<i>α</i>1. After acute renal I/R injury, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, LDH activity, and oxidative stress in renal tissue significantly increased. Rg1 pretreatment upregulated AMPK<i>α</i>1 expression, which protects against acute renal I/R injury by maintaining renal function homeostasis, inhibiting oxidative stress, and reducing apoptosis. Compound C, a specific inhibitor of AMPK, reversed the effects of Rg1. In summary, Rg1 pretreatment upregulated AMPK<i>α</i>1 expression, inhibited oxidative stress, maintained mitochondrial function, improved energy metabolism, reduced apoptosis, and ultimately protected renal tissue against acute renal I/R injury.	2022	09	13	Oxid Med Cell Longev	Zhou	Qing
36092554	10.1021/acsomega.2c02796	Lycopene Effects on Metabolic Syndrome and Kidney Injury in Rats Fed a High-Fat Diet: An Experimental Study.	The frequency of overweight and obesity is rising globally. These disorders are prevalent health problems. It has a substantial correlation with a number of health issues, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and diabetes mellitus disorders. Lycopene (Lyc) is an acyclic structural isomer of β-carotene and has powerful antioxidant properties with various promising therapeutic effects. In this study, rats fed a high-fat diet were examined to determine how lycopene affected metabolic syndrome and kidney damage. After being acclimated, rats were divided into 5 groups (<i>n</i> = 8/group) as follows: the first group served as the control and was fed on a normal pelleted diet (4.25% fat) until the end of the experiment. The second group (high-fat diet; HFD) was fed on a high-fat diet (45.5 kcal% fat) composed of 24% fat, 24% protein, and 41% carbohydrate. The third and fourth groups were fed on HFD and administered lycopene at 25 and 50 mg/kg bodyweight orally every day. The fifth group (standard drug group) received HFD and simvastatin (SVS; 10 mg/kg bodyweight orally daily) for 3 months. Tissue samples from the kidney were taken for determination of the biochemical parameters, lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl (PC), reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiol group, antioxidant enzymes, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR), in addition to renal mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), renal levels of inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)], and apoptotic markers (BCL2 Associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio). When compared to the control group, the HFD group's food consumption, body weight, serum levels of glucose, uric acid, creatinine, LPO, PC, TNF-α, IL-1β, Bax, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio all increased significantly. In the kidney sample of HFD-fed rats, there was a downregulation of Nrf2 mRNA expression along with a significant reduction in the enzymatic activity of SOD, CAT, GR, and GPx. Lyc treatment was able to successfully reverse HFD-mediated changes as compared to the HFD group. Consuming lyc helps to prevent fat and renal damage in a positive way.	2022	09	13	ACS Omega	Albrahim	Tarfa
36098711	10.1111/cbdd.14144	The expression of miR-181b, CYLD, CBX-7, BCL2, and p53 in osteosarcoma patients and correlation with clinicopathological factors.	Osteosarcoma is a common human malignancy with a high mortality rate worldwide. Recent studies have been focused on understanding the involvement of microRNA (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. Therefore, the present study aimed to measure the expression levels of miR-181a, cylindromatosis (CYLD), chromo box homolog 7 (CBX7), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and tumor protein p53 in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissues in patients with osteosarcoma and its relationship with clinicopathological factors. The expression levels of miR-181a, CYLD, CBX7, BCL2, and p53 were measured in 60 patients with osteosarcoma using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, we compared the relationship between these gene levels and clinicopathological factors in tumor and healthy tissues. Our results showed that the expression levels of miR-181a, BCL2, and p53 were significantly higher in osteosarcoma tissue in comparison to normal tissues (P&lt; 0.05). On the other hand, CYLD and CBX7 were downregulated in osteosarcoma tumor tissues compared to adjacent healthy tissues (P&lt; 0.05). In addition, the expression levels of miR-181a in tumor tissues were strongly correlated with patients' age, tumor size, clinical stage, cancer grade, and lymph node metastasis (P&lt; 0.05). Our findings highlight new insights into understanding the role of miR-181a in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. However, further studies are needed to elucidate miRNA as therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma.	2022	09	13	Chem Biol Drug Des	Fazli	Jafar
36100068	10.1016/j.fsi.2022.09.005	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of B-cell lymphoma-2 protein in Amphiprion clarkii and its role in virus infections.	Amphiprion clarkii is increasingly being used as a captive-bred ornamental fish in South Korea. However, its breeding has recently been greatly hindered by destructive diseases due to pathogens. B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), a mitochondrial apoptosis regulatory gene involved in immune responses, has not been investigated in anemonefish, including A. clarkii. Herein, we aimed to annotate Bcl2 in the A. clarkii transcriptome and examined its role against virus infections. Sequence analysis indicated that Bcl2 in A. clarkii (AcBcl2) contained all four Bcl-2 homology domains. The structure of AcBcl2 closely resembled those of previously analyzed anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins in mammals. Expression analysis showed that the highest level of AcBcl2 was expressed in blood. AcBcl2 expression in the blood was downregulated within 24 hpi when challenged with immune stimulants poly I:C and lipopolysaccharides. AcBcl2 reduced poly I:C-induced cell death. The propagation of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was higher in the presence of AcBcl2. Cell mortality was higher in AcBcl2 when transfected cells were infected with VHSV, and a higher viral transcript was observed compared to their respective controls. In conclusion, AcBcl2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, and its activity may facilitate the propagation of VHSV.	2022	09	13	Fish Shellfish Immunol	Madushani	K P
32515262	10.1089/neu.2020.7028	B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) Gene Is Associated with Intracranial Hypertension after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.	Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) activates the apoptotic cascade in neurons and glia as part of secondary cellular injury. B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>Bcl-2</i>) gene encodes a pro-survival protein to suppress programmed cell death, and variation in this gene has potential to affect intracranial pressure (ICP). Participants were recruited from a single clinical center using a prospective observational study design. Inclusion criteria were: age 16-80 years; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 4-8; and at least 24 h of ICP monitoring treated between 2000-2014. Outcomes were mean ICP, spikes &gt;20 and &gt;25 mm Hg, edema, and surgical intervention. Odds ratios (OR), mean increases/decreases (B), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. In 264 patients, average age was 39.2 years old and 78% of patients were male. Mean ICPs were 11.4 ± 0.4 mm Hg for patients with homozygous wild-type (AA), 12.8 ± 0.6 mm Hg for heterozygous (AG), and 14.3 ± 1.2 mm Hg for homozygous variant (GG; <i>p</i> = 0.023). <i>Rs17759659</i> GG genotype was associated with more ICP spikes &gt;20 mm Hg (<i>p</i> = 0.017) and &gt;25 mm Hg (<i>p</i> = 0.048). Multi-variate analysis showed that GG relative to AA genotype had higher ICP (B = 2.7 mm Hg, 95% CI [0.5,4.9], <i>p</i> = 0.015), edema (OR = 2.5 [1.0, 6.0], <i>p</i> = 0.049) and need for decompression (OR = 3.7 [1.5-9.3], <i>p</i> = 0.004). In this prospective severe TBI cohort, <i>Bcl-2 rs17759659</i> was associated with increased risk of intracranial hypertension, cerebral edema, and need for surgical intervention. The variant allele may impact programmed cell death of injured neurons, resulting in elevated ICP and post-traumatic secondary insults. Further risk stratification and targeted genotype-based therapies could improve outcomes after severe TBI.	2021	11	24	J Neurotrauma	Deng	Hansen
32749680	10.1002/jcp.29943	Light-emitting diode irradiation induces AKT/mTOR-mediated apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft mouse model.	The beneficial effects of light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation have been reported in various pathologies, including cancer. However, its effect in pancreatic cancer cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that blue LED of 460 nm regulated pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by suppressing the expression of apoptosis-related factors, such as mutant p53 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and decreasing the expression of RAC-β serine/threonine kinase 2 (AKT2), the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Blue LED irradiation also increased the levels of cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 in pancreatic cancer cells, while it suppressed AKT2 expression and inhibited tumor growth in xenograft tumor tissues. In conclusion, blue LED irradiation suppressed pancreatic cancer cell and tumor growth by regulating AKT/mTOR signaling. Our findings indicated that blue LEDs could be used as a nonpharmacological treatment for pancreatic cancer.	2021	09	07	J Cell Physiol	Kim	Young Mi
32912960	10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206767	<i>BCL2</i> and <i>BCL6</i> atypical/unbalanced gene rearrangements in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are indicators of an aggressive clinical course.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that represents a heterogeneous group of disease that is differentially characterised by clinical, molecular and cytogenetic features. <i>MYC</i>, <i>BCL2</i> and <i>BCL6</i> gene rearrangements have been identified as prognostic factors in DLBCL, especially for <i>MYC</i>. Nevertheless the frequency and effect of atypical/unbalanced <i>BCL6, BCL2</i> and <i>MYC</i> translocations in DLBCL is not fully documented. Here, we aimed to analyse those atypical/unbalanced rearrangements in DLBCL and to assess their prognostic impact. We collected tumour tissue and clinical data from 97 DLBCL and used interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with break-apart probe to characterise <i>BCL6, BCL2</i> and <i>MYC</i> gene pattern. 19 of 97 (19,6%) cases of DLBCL had atypical/ unbalanced gene rearrangements (14 involving <i>BCL6</i> gene, 5 involving <i>BCL2</i> gene and none involving <i>MYC</i> gene). Compared with patients with simple gene rearrangement and patients without cytogenetic abnormality, patients with atypical/unbalanced gene rearrangement were in an unfavourable risk group by the International Prognostic Index (p=0039), died of disease (p=0012), harboured relapse or progression (p=0011) and had shorter overall (p=0,04), relapse free (p=0029) and event free (p=0026) survival. We showed that patients with DLBCL with <i>BCL2</i> or <i>BCL6</i> atypical/unbalanced rearrangements constituted a group of patients with poor outcome. We also underlined the importance of FISH analyses, easily feasible in routine practise, at diagnosis of DLBCL to detect the rather frequent and clinically significant atypical/unbalanced aberrations of these genes.	2021	10	04	J Clin Pathol	Tourneret	Alicia
33120427	10.1182/blood.2020007193	The impact of MYC and BCL2 structural variants in tumors of DLBCL morphology and mechanisms of false-negative MYC IHC.	When the World Health Organization defined high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH) as a clinical category, rearrangements were the only structural variant (SV) incorporated. An ""atypical double-hit"" category has been proposed, encompassing tumors with concurrent MYC and BCL2 SVs other than cooccurring translocations (ie, copy number variations [CNVs]). Although the identification of a gene expression signature (DHITsig) shared among tumors harboring MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2) has confirmed a common underlying biology, the biological implication of MYC and BCL2 CNVs requires further elucidation. We performed a comprehensive analysis of MYC and BCL2 SVs, as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), in a cohort of 802 de novo tumors with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma morphology. Although BCL2 CNVs were associated with increased expression, MYC CNVs were not. Furthermore, MYC and BCL2 CNVs, in the context of atypical double-hit, did not confer a similar gene expression profile as HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2. Finally, although MYC immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been proposed as a screening tool for FISH testing, 2 mechanisms were observed that uncoupled MYC rearrangement from IHC positivity: (1) low MYC messenger RNA expression; and (2) false-negative IHC staining mediated by a single-nucleotide polymorphism resulting in an asparagine-to-serine substitution at the 11th amino acid residue of MYC (MYC-N11S). Taken together, these results support the current exclusion of MYC and BCL2 CNVs from HGBL-DH/TH and highlight the ability of a molecular-based classification system to identify tumors with shared biology that FISH and IHC fail to fully capture.	2021	09	28	Blood	Collinge	Brett
33356554	10.2217/epi-2020-0189	Epigenetic targeting of Waldenström macroglobulinemia cells with BET inhibitors synergizes with BCL2 or histone deacetylase inhibition.	<b>Aim:</b> Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a low-grade B-cell lymphoma characterized by overproduction of monoclonal IgM. To date, there are no therapies that provide a cure for WM patients, and therefore, it is important to explore new therapies. Little is known about the efficiency of epigenetic targeting in WM. <b>Materials &amp; methods:</b> WM cells were treated with BET inhibitors (JQ1 and I-BET-762) and venetoclax, panobinostat or ibrutinib. <b>Results:</b> BET inhibition reduces growth of WM cells, with little effect on survival. This finding was enhanced by combination therapy, with panobinostat (LBH589) showing the highest synergy. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our studies identify BET inhibitors as effective therapy for WM, and these inhibitors can be enhanced in combination with BCL2 or histone deacetylase inhibition.	2022	03	02	Epigenomics	Matissek	Stephan J
33423045	10.1038/s41419-020-03311-1	GNA13 regulates BCL2 expression and the sensitivity of GCB-DLBCL cells to BCL2 inhibitors in a palmitoylation-dependent manner.	GNA13, encoding one of the G protein alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins that transduce signals of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), is frequently mutated in germinal center B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL) with poor prognostic outcomes. Due to the ""undruggable"" nature of GNA13, targeted therapy for these patients is not available. In this study, we found that palmitoylation of GNA13 not only regulates its plasma membrane localization, but also regulates GNA13's stability. It is essential for the tumor suppressor function of GNA13 in GCB-DLBCL cells. Interestingly, GNA13 negatively regulates BCL2 expression in GCB-DLBCL cells in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. Consistently, BCL2 inhibitors were found to be effective in killing GNA13-deficient GCB-DLBCL cells in a cell-based chemical screen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inactivating GNA13 by targeting its palmitoylation enhanced the sensitivity of GCB-DLBCL to the BCL2 inhibitor. These studies indicate that the loss-of-function mutation of GNA13 is a biomarker for BCL2 inhibitor therapy of GCB-DLBCL and that GNA13 palmitoylation is a potential target for combination therapy with BCL2 inhibitors to treat GCB-DLBCL with wild-type GNA13.	2021	10	05	Cell Death Dis	Xia	Zhizhou
33480087	10.1002/hon.2839	High-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 translocations lack tumor-associated macrophages and PD-L1 expression: A possible noninflamed subgroup.	We investigated the intratumoral source of PD-L1 expression and the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) with or without MYC-translocation, as well as possible correlations to BCL2-and BCL6-translocations and cell of origin (COO). One-hundred and twenty-six patient samples were studied in a cohort enriched for MYC-translocated tumors with 34 samples carrying this translocation. Demonstration of intratumoral distribution and cellular source of PD-L1 was enabled by immunohistochemical (IHC) dual staining specifically highlighting PD-L1 expression in lymphoma B-cells with antibodies against PD-L1 and PAX5. Additional IHC with antibodies against CD68 and CD163 identified TAMs. We found that CD68-positive TAMs were the main source of PD-L1 protein expression in contrast to lymphoma B cells which rarely expressed PD-L1. Semiquantitative IHC demonstrated a significant correlation between CD68 and PD-L1 protein expression. Unsupervised hierarchical analysis of PD-L1, CD68, and CD163 IHC data subsequently demonstrated three potential clusters defined by expression of the three biomarkers. Cluster A consisted of patient samples with significantly lower expression of PD-L1, CD68, and CD163, but also significantly higher prevalence of BCL2-translocation and MYC-BCL2-double-hit (DH) compared to the other two clusters. In cluster C we found a significant accumulation of BCL6 translocated tumors. This cluster in contrast had the highest protein expression of PD-L1, CD68, and CD163. Cluster B tumors had an intermediate expression of the three biomarkers, but no accumulation of the specific genetic translocations. Our data, which were based on morphological analysis, immunophenotyping and genotyping by fluorescence in situ hybridization were in line with new concepts of LBCL taxonomy integrating genetic, phenotypical, and immunological characteristics with identification of new subgroups where MYC translocation and MYC-BCL2 DH may identify a noninflamed subtype. These findings may furthermore hold significant predictive value especially regarding immune checkpoint blockade therapy, but further molecular characterization should be done to substantiate this hypothesis.	2021	08	17	Hematol Oncol	Breinholt	Marie F
33495811	10.3892/ijmm.2021.4858	Effects of Smad4 on the expression of caspase‑3 and Bcl‑2 in human gingival fibroblasts cultured on 3D PLGA scaffolds induced by compressive force.	Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) are the main cells that comprise gingival tissue, where they transfer mechanical signals under physiological and pathological conditions. The exact mechanism underlying gingival tissue reconstruction under compressive forces remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Smad4, caspase‑3 and Bcl‑2 on the proliferation of HGFs induced by compressive force. HGFs were cultured on poly(lactide‑co‑glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds under an optimal compressive force of 25 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cell viability was determined via Cell Counting Kit‑8 assays at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The expression levels of Smad4, caspase‑3 and Bcl‑2 were measured via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. The application of compressive force on HGFs for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in cell proliferation and Bcl‑2 expression, but a significant decrease in the expression of Smad4 and caspase‑3; however, inverse trends were observed by 72 h. Subsequently, a lentivirus was used to overexpress Smad4 in HGFs, which attenuated the effects of compressive force on HGF proliferation and Bcl‑2 expression, but enhanced caspase‑3 expression, suggesting that Smad4 may regulate compressive force‑induced apoptosis in HGFs. In conclusion, these findings increased understanding regarding the mechanisms of compressive force‑induced HGF proliferation and apoptosis, which may provide further insight for improving the efficacy and stability of orthodontic treatment.	2021	07	16	Int J Mol Med	Zhao	Shuang
33580459	10.1007/s11033-021-06161-y	Increased level of long non coding RNA H19 is correlated with the downregulation of miR-326 and BCL-2 genes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a possible hallmark for leukemogenesis.	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their role in competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks have emerged as fundamental debates in the biological processes of initiation and progression of cancer. This study aimed to identify and measure the expression levels of relevant ceRNA regulatory genes contributing to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). lncRNA H19 and BCL-2 mRNA were chosen based on in silico studies and their interactions with miR-326. Subsequently, the aforementioned coding/non-coding gene expression profiles were measured using qRT-PCR in 50 bone marrow samples, including 33 cases with pediatric ALL and 17 controls with no evidence of malignancy. lncRNA H19 was identified as an oncogenic factor which was noticeably increased in the newly diagnosed patients (P = 0.0019, AUC = 0.84) and negatively associated with miR-326 (r = -0.6, P = 0.02). Furthermore, a negative correlation was introduced between the transcriptional levels of miR-326 and the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 gene (r = -0.6, P = 0.028). The novel experimental and bioinformatic results achieved in this study may provide new insights into the molecular leukemogenesis of pediatric ALL.	2021	06	01	Mol Biol Rep	Mofidi	Mahtab
33605072	10.1111/jcmm.16373	Cyclic stretching boosts microRNA-499 to regulate Bcl-2 via microRNA-208a in atrial fibroblasts.	MicroRNAs that modulate transcription can regulate other microRNAs and are also up-regulated under pathological stress. MicroRNA-499 (miR-499), microRNA-208a (miR-208a) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) play roles in cardiovascular diseases, such as direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblast into cardiomyocyte and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Whether miR208a, miR499 and Bcl-2 were critical regulators in cardiac fibroblast apoptosis under mechanical stretching conditions in human cardiac fibroblasts-adult atrial (HCF-aa) was investigated. Using negative pressure, HCF-aa grown on a flexible membrane base were cyclically stretched to 20% of their maximum elongation. In adult rats, an aortocaval shunt was used to create an in vivo model of volume overload. MiR208a was up-regulated early by stretching and returned to normal levels with longer stretching cycles, whereas the expression of miR499 and Bcl-2 was up-regulated by longer stretching times. Pre-treatment with antagomir-499 reversed the miR-208a down-regulation, whereas Bcl-2 expression could be suppressed by miR-208a overexpression. In the HCF-aa under stretching for 1 h, miR-499 overexpression decreased pri-miR-208a luciferase activity; this inhibition of pri-miR-208a luciferase activity with stretching was reversed when the miR-499-5p binding site in pri-miR-208a was mutated. The addition of antagomir-208a reversed the Bcl-2-3'UTR suppression from stretching for 1 h. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that pre-treatment with miR-499 or antagomir-208a inhibited cellular apoptosis in stretched HCF-aa. In hearts with volume overload, miR-499 overexpression inhibited myocardial miR-208a expression, whereas Bcl-2 expression could be suppressed by the addition of miR-208a. In conclusion, miR-208a mediated the regulation of miR-499 on Bcl-2 expression in stretched HCF-aa and hearts with volume overload.	2021	09	23	J Cell Mol Med	Chua	Su-Kiat

33799592	10.3390/ijms22062841	Co-Operativity between MYC and BCL-2 Pro-Survival Proteins in Cancer.	B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), c-MYC and related proteins are arguably amongst the most widely studied in all of biology. Every year there are thousands of papers reporting on different aspects of their biochemistry, cellular and physiological mechanisms and functions. This plethora of literature can be attributed to both proteins playing essential roles in the normal functioning of a cell, and by extension a whole organism, but also due to their central role in disease, most notably, cancer. Many cancers arise due to genetic lesions resulting in deregulation of both proteins, and indeed the development and survival of tumours is often dependent on co-operativity between these protein families. In this review we will discuss the individual roles of both proteins in cancer, describe cancers where co-operativity between them has been well-characterised and finally, some strategies to target these proteins therapeutically.	2021	04	26	Int J Mol Sci	Fairlie	Walter Douglas
33858042	10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.02.006	[The incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma].	<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement in Chinese diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . <b>Methods:</b> From January 2013 to August 2020, 922 DLBCL cases were collected. C-MYC and BCL2 protein expression levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect the structural abnormalities of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6, including gene breaks and copy number changes. <b>Results:</b> MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene breaks were found in 29 out of 922 DLBCL cases (3.15%) , including 25 cases of double-hit lymphoma (DHL; 14 cases involving MYC and BCL2 rearrangements and 11 cases involving MYC and BCL6 rearrangements) and four cases involving MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements, referring to triple-hit lymphoma. According to the threshold of C-MYC ≥40% and BCL2 ≥50%, 541 cases (58.68%) overexpressed C-MYC and BCL2 proteins, including 22 DHL cases. Moreover, according to the threshold of C-MYC ≥70% and BCL2 ≥50%, 52 cases (5.64%) overexpressed C-MYC and BCL2 proteins, including nine DHL cases. The P53 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The mutant P53 expression pattern was shown in 101 out of 709 cases (14.25%) , whereas 13 cases (1.83%) were negative, likely indicating P53 gene fragment deletion. <b>Conclusion:</b> The incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements was low in DLBCLs, and no significant correlation between gene abnormality and protein overexpression was shown. The correct diagnosis of DHL depends on molecular genetic detection. <b>目的：</b> 探究伴MYC、BCL2和（或）BCL6重排的高级别B细胞淋巴瘤在弥漫大B细胞淋巴瘤（DLBCL）中的发生率。 <b>方法：</b> 回顾性收集2013年1月至2020年8月共922例DLBCL患者的临床资料，检测C-MYC及BCL2蛋白表达情况，并应用FISH技术检测MYC、BCL2和BCL6基因断裂及拷贝数变化等结构异常。 <b>结果：</b> 922例DLBCL病例中，29例（3.15%）检测到MYC、BCL2和（或）BCL6基因断裂，其中25例为双重打击淋巴瘤（DHL），14例为MYC合并BCL2基因断裂，11例为MYC合并BCL6基因断裂；4例为三重打击淋巴瘤（THL）。以C-MYC表达≥40%、BCL2表达≥50%作为阳性阈值时，541例（58.68%）患者同时高表达C-MYC和BCL2；以C-MYC表达≥70%及BCL2表达≥50%作为阳性阈值时，52例（5.64%）患者同时高表达C-MYC和BCL2。DHL患者中，22例C-MYC表达≥40%且BCL2表达≥50%，其中9例C-MYC表达≥70%且BCL2表达≥50%。709例患者检测了P53蛋白表达，其中101例（14.25%）为突变型，13例（1.83%）为阴性，提示可能存在大片段缺失。 <b>结论：</b> 伴MYC、BCL2和（或）BCL6重排的高级别B细胞淋巴瘤在DLBCL中的发生率较低，基因结构异常与蛋白高表达之间无明显相关性；DHL的检出依赖分子遗传学检测。.	2021	04	19	Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Li	M
33910828	10.21873/invivo.12403	Depletion of NK Cells Resistant to Ionizing Radiation Increases Mutations in Mice After Whole-body Irradiation.	Ionizing radiation is a very powerful genetic mutagenic agent. Although immune cells are very sensitive to radiation, their sensitivity varies between different types of immune cell. We hypothesized that radiation-resistant immune cells survive after irradiation and then play a role in removing mutant cells. Splenic lymphocytes and mice were irradiated with γ-rays. Cell populations were analyzed using flow cytometry after dyeing with antibodies and expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) was measured by western blot analysis. To deplete natural killer (NK) cells, anti-asialo GM1 antiserum was used. Micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes were measured by May-Grunwald/Giemsa staining. H-2Kb loss variant in T-cells induced by irradiation of B6C3F1 mice were detected by flow cytometry. When splenic lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro, B cells notably died, while NK cells did not. In vivo, on the third day after whole-body irradiation, the total number of lymphocytes in the spleen decreased rapidly, but the proportion of NK cells was approximately three times higher than that of the normal control group. In addition, it was confirmed that high expression of BCL2 in NK cells was maintained after irradiation, whereas that of B-cells was not. Removal of NK cells by injection with anti-asialo GM1 antiserum immediately after irradiation increased the micronuclei of polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow and the variant fraction with H-2kb loss in the spleen. These results provide important evidence that radioresistant NK cells apparently survive by escaping apoptosis in the early stages after irradiation, and work to eliminate mutant cells resulting from γ-ray irradiation. Future studies are needed to reveal why NK cells are resistant to radiation and the in-depth mechanisms involved in the elimination of radiation-induced mutant cells.	2021	06	18	In Vivo	Park	Hae-Ran
33912159	10.3389/fimmu.2021.627602	The <i>Traf2</i>DNx<i>BCL2-tg</i> Mouse Model of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma Recapitulates the Biased IGHV Gene Usage, Stereotypy, and Antigen-Specific HCDR3 Selection of Its Human Counterpart.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is a heterogeneous disease consisting of at least two separate subtypes, based on the mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) sequence. Exposure to antigens seems to play a role in malignant transformation and in the selection and expansion of more aggressive CLL clones. Furthermore, a biased usage of particular IGHV gene subgroups and the existence of stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs) are distinctive characteristics of human CLL. We have previously described that <i>Traf2</i>DN/<i>BCL2</i> double-transgenic (tg, <sup>+/+</sup>) mice develop CLL/SLL with high incidence with aging. In this model, TNF-Receptor Associated Factor (TRAF)-2 deficiency cooperates with B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 in promoting CLL/SLL in mice by specifically enforcing marginal zone (MZ) B cell differentiation and rendering B cells independent of BAFF for survival. In this report, we have performed the sequencing of the IGHV-D-J rearrangements of B cell clones from the <i>Traf2</i>DN/<i>BCL2</i>-tg<sup>+/+</sup> mice with CLL/SLL. The results indicate that these mice develop oligoclonal and monoclonal B cell expansions. Allotransplantation of the oligoclonal populations into immunodeficient mice resulted in the preferential expansion of one of the parental clones. The analysis of the IGHV sequences indicated that 15% were mutated (M) and 85% unmutated (UM). Furthermore, while the <i>Traf2</i>DN/<i>BCL2</i>-tg<sup>-/-</sup> (wild-type), <sup>-/+</sup> (<i>BCL2</i> single-tg) and <sup>+/-</sup> (<i>Traf2DN</i>DN single-tg) littermates showed the expression of various IGHV gene subgroups, the CLL/SLL expanded clones from the <i>Traf2</i>DN/<i>BCL2</i>-tg<sup>+/+</sup> (double-transgenic) mice showed a more restricted IGHV gene subgroup usage and an overrepresentation of particular IGHV genes. In addition, the HCDR3-encoded protein sequence indicates the existence of stereotyped immunoglobulin (Ig) in the BCRs and strong similarities with BCR recognizing autoantigens and pathogen-associated antigens. Altogether, these results highlight the remarkable similarities between the CLL/SLL developed by the <i>Traf2</i>DN/<i>BCL2</i>-tg<sup>+/+</sup> mice and its human counterpart.	2021	09	20	Front Immunol	Perez-Chacon	Gema
33912563	10.3389/fcell.2021.647522	Expression Level of ADAMTS1 in Granulosa Cells of PCOS Patients Is Related to Granulosa Cell Function, Oocyte Quality, and Embryo Development.	A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1) is an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase that plays an important role in the process of ovulation. According to previous studies, the expression level of ADAMTS1 in the granulosa cells of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients and the mechanism for regulating oocyte quality and embryonic development potential are still unclear. Our research clarified that ADAMTS1 was significantly increased in granulosa cells of PCOS patients as compared to ovulatory controls. After silencing ADAMTS1 in granulosa cells, cell proliferation and E<sub>2</sub> secretion were significantly inhibited, which may be related to the down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family genes and key genes involved in E<sub>2</sub> synthesis. Through retrospective analysis of the clinical data, it was found that the expression level of ADAMTS1 was significantly positively correlated to the oocyte maturation rate and good-quality embryo rate in PCOS patients. The downregulation of ADAMTS1 in primary granulosa cells lead to the changes in the expression of marker genes for oocyte and embryonic quality. By using immunofluorescence staining, it was found ADAMTS1 was expressed in various stages of pre-implantation embryo but its expression level gradually decreases with the development of the embryo. In addition, the silence of ADAMTS1 in 3PN zygotes significantly prolonged the development time of the zygote to the morula stage. This is, to our knowledge, the first time to explored the mechanism by which ADAMST1 is involved in affecting the quality of oocytes and embryonic development potential, which will provide new evidence for further understanding of the follicular microenvironment and embryo development.	2021	04	30	Front Cell Dev Biol	Yang	Guang
33914737	10.1371/journal.pone.0237830	Loss-of-function of Fbxo10, encoding a post-translational regulator of BCL2 in lymphomas, has no discernible effect on BCL2 or B lymphocyte accumulation in mice.	Regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein determines cell survival and is frequently abnormal in B cell lymphomas. An evolutionarily conserved post-translational mechanism for over-expression of BCL2 in human B cell lymphomas and the BCL2 paralogue CED-9 in Caenorhabditis elegans results from loss-of-function mutations in human FBXO10 and its C.elegans paralogue DRE-1, a BCL2/CED-9-binding subunit of the SKP-CULLIN-FBOX (SCF) ubiquitin ligase. Here, we tested the role of FBXO10 in BCL2 regulation by producing mice with two different CRISPR/Cas9-engineered Fbxo10 mutations: an Asp54Lys (E54K) missense mutation in the FBOX domain and a Cys55SerfsTer55 frameshift (fs) truncating mutation. Mice homozygous for either mutant allele were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and appeared normal in body weight and appearance as adults. Spleen B cells from homozygous mutant mice did not have increased BCL2 protein, nor were the numbers of mature B cells or germinal centre B cells increased as would be expected if BCL2 was increased. Other lymphocyte subsets that are also regulated by BCL2 levels also displayed no difference in frequency in homozygous Fbxo10 mutant mice. These results support one of two conclusions: either FBXO10 does not regulate BCL2 in mice, or it does so redundantly with other ubiquitin ligase complexes. Possible candidates for the latter include FBXO11 or ARTS-XIAP. The difference between the role of FBXO10 in regulating BCL2 protein levels in C. elegans and in human DLBCL, relative to single-gene deficient mouse leukocytes, should be further investigated.	2021	09	14	PLoS One	Masle-Farquhar	Etienne
33917107	10.3390/ijms22083829	Quercetin Attenuates Brain Oxidative Alterations Induced by Iron Oxide Nanoparticles in Rats.	Iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) therapy has diverse health benefits but high doses or prolonged therapy might induce oxidative cellular injuries especially in the brain. Therefore, we conducted the current study to investigate the protective role of quercetin supplementation against the oxidative alterations induced in the brains of rats due to IONPs. Forty adult male albino rats were allocated into equal five groups; the control received a normal basal diet, the IONP group was intraperitoneally injected with IONPs of 50 mg/kg body weight (B.W.) and quercetin-treated groups had IONPs + Q25, IONPs + Q50 and IONPs + Q100 that were orally supplanted with quercetin by doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg quercetin/kg B.W. daily, respectively, administrated with the same dose of IONPs for 30 days. IONPs induced significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) and significantly decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Consequently, IONPs significantly induced severe brain tissue injuries due to the iron deposition leading to oxidative alterations with significant increases in brain creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Furthermore, IONPs induced significant reductions in brain epinephrine, serotonin and melatonin with the downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (<i>PGC-1α</i>) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (<i>mtTFA</i>) mRNA expressions. IONPs induced apoptosis in the brain monitored by increases in caspase 3 and decreases in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression levels. Quercetin supplementation notably defeated brain oxidative damages and in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, quercetin supplementation during IONPs is highly recommended to gain the benefits of IONPs with fewer health hazards.	2021	05	20	Int J Mol Sci	Dora	Mohamed F
33934404	10.1002/jcla.23784	PCR array analysis identified hyperproliferation but not autophagy or apoptosis in fibrous epulis.	The pathogenesis of fibrous epulis is still quite unclear. Our recent genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis revealed that in fibrous epulis, RAS-PI3K-AKT-NF-κB pathway regulates the expression of Bcl-2 family and IAP family genes, leading to increased proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can promote autophagy in human gingival fibroblasts; therefore, the purpose of the present study was to identify whether autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of fibrous epulis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between fibrous epulis lesions and normal gingival tissues were identified using the PCR array. The expression levels of eighteen autophagy-related (ATG) family genes, twelve B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family genes, and eleven cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease (caspase) family genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Autophagy induction was determined by measuring microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) conversion (LC3-I to LC3-II) by immunoblot analysis. The PCR array identified six upregulated genes, whereas no genes were expressed at significantly lower levels. The upregulated genes were BCL2, BCL2L1, CXCR4, HSP90AA1, HSPA8, and IGF1, which all belong to the ""regulation of autophagy"" group but not the ""autophagy machinery components"" group. qRT-PCR verified that the expression levels of BCL2, BCL2L1 (also known as BCL-XL), and BCL2L2 (also known as BCL-W) were significantly increased in fibrous epulis. No LC3-I to LC3-II conversion was observed. The present study reveals that in fibrous epulis, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL coordinately mediate gingival cell escape from apoptosis, leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Moreover, ATG family genes are not activated, and autophagy is not involved in this process.	2021	12	13	J Clin Lab Anal	Jiang	Yangyang
33938687	10.36849/JDD.5373	A Case of Cutaneous Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm Treated With a Bcl-2 Inhibitor.	Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive primary cutaneous lymphoma characterized by transformed plasmacytoid dendritic cells that overexpress interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha (IL3RA) also known as CD123. In addition to several therapies currently undergoing clinical trials, Tagraxofusp-erzs (Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., NY) is a single FDA-approved option available for treatment of adults and children over 2 years of age suffering from BPDCN. It was designed to target CD123 overexpression in BPDCN as a CD123-directed cytotoxin consisting of a recombinant human interleukin-3 fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin. We discuss a case of a male patient in his late 70s&amp;rsquo; who presented with an asymptomatic rash involving the back and the right knee that initially developed as pink patches, progressed into plaques, and subsequently rapidly evolved into a tumor involving the right knee that was confirmed as BPDCN on skin biopsy and was accompanied by bone marrow involvement. Upon initiation of first line tagraxofusp-erzs therapy, the patient did not achieve improvement. However, off-label use of venetoclax (AbbVie Inc, IL and Genentech-USA, CA), a Bcl2 inhibitor currently in a Phase I clinical trial, resulted in a satisfactory clinical outcome, nearly complete resolution of a right knee tumor lesion, and deferment of bone marrow transplant. We believe that our case exemplifies the complexity of BPDCN, briefly reviews current treatment and management options that are only in their infancy and raises awareness towards success with alternative off-label therapies such as venetoclax when treating BPDCN.

However, possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the auditory pathology of AD patients are not known. According to our past research findings that the thresholds of auditory brainstem response, but not distortion product otoacoustic emissions, were significantly increased in AD mice from 9 months of age and thereafter. Thus, we further explored the possible mechanism of auditory degradation of 3×Tg-AD mice in this study. Our histochemical staining evidence showed the cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), but not the cochlear hair cells, were lost significantly in the cochlea of 3×Tg-AD mice from 9 months of age and thereafter. Our immunostaining and western blotting evidence showed that phosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau), p-glycogen synthase kinase 3, neurofilament, and apoptosis-related p53, Bcl2-associated X protein, cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were gradually increased, but B-cell lymphoma 2 was gradually decreased with age growth in the cochlea of 3×Tg-AD mice. We suggested that tau hyperphosphorylation and p-Tau 181 aggregation, and mitochondria- and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis may play a role in the degeneration of SGN in the cochlea. Progressive SGN degeneration in the cochlea may contribute to hearing loss of aging 3×Tg-AD mice.	2021	05	05	Chin J Physiol	Wang	Sheue-Er
33939407	10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c02200	Pharmacological Targeting of Executioner Proteins: Controlling Life and Death.	Small-molecule mediated modulation of protein interactions of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) family proteins was clinically validated in 2015 when Venetoclax, a selective inhibitor of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2, achieved breakthrough status designation by the FDA for treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Since then, substantial progress has been made in identifying inhibitors of other interactions of antiapoptosis proteins. However, targeting their pro-apoptotic counterparts, the ""executioners"" BAX, BAK, and BOK that both initiate and commit the cell to dying, has lagged behind. However, recent publications demonstrate that these proteins can be positively or negatively regulated using small molecule tool compounds. The results obtained with these molecules suggest that pharmaceutical regulation of apoptosis will have broad implications that extend beyond activating cell death in cancer. We review recent advances in identifying compounds and their utility in the exogenous control of life and death by regulating executioner proteins, with emphasis on the prototype BAX.	2021	06	16	J Med Chem	Pogmore	Justin P
33945543	10.1371/journal.pone.0248886	Detection of new drivers of frequent B-cell lymphoid neoplasms using an integrated analysis of whole genomes.	B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders exhibit a diverse spectrum of diagnostic entities with heterogeneous behaviour. Multiple efforts have focused on the determination of the genomic drivers of B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In the meantime, the aggregation of diverse tumors in pan-cancer genomic studies has become a useful tool to detect new driver genes, while enabling the comparison of mutational patterns across tumors. Here we present an integrated analysis of 354 B-cell lymphoid disorders. 112 recurrently mutated genes were discovered, of which KMT2D, CREBBP, IGLL5 and BCL2 were the most frequent, and 31 genes were putative new drivers. Mutations in CREBBP, TNFRSF14 and KMT2D predominated in follicular lymphoma, whereas those in BTG2, HTA-A and PIM1 were more frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Additionally, we discovered 31 significantly mutated protein networks, reinforcing the role of genes such as CREBBP, EEF1A1, STAT6, GNA13 and TP53, but also pointing towards a myriad of infrequent players in lymphomagenesis. Finally, we report aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors associated with novel noncoding mutations (DTX1 and S1PR2), and new recurrent copy number aberrations affecting immune check-point regulators (CD83, PVR) and B-cell specific genes (TNFRSF13C). Our analysis expands the number of mutational drivers of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, and identifies several differential somatic events between disease subtypes.	2021	10	07	PLoS One	Mosquera Orgueira	Adrián
33946435	10.3390/cancers13092167	Genetic Events Inhibiting Apoptosis in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is curable with chemoimmunotherapy in ~65% of patients. One of the hallmarks of the pathogenesis and resistance to therapy in DLBCL is inhibition of apoptosis, which allows malignant cells to survive and acquire further alterations. Inhibition of apoptosis can be the result of genetic events inhibiting the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways, as well as their modulators, such as the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, P53, and components of the NF-kB pathway. Mechanisms of dysregulation include upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins via point mutations, amplifications, deletions, translocations, and influences of other proteins. Understanding the factors contributing to resistance to apoptosis in DLBCL is crucial in order to be able to develop targeted therapies that could improve outcomes by restoring apoptosis in malignant cells. This review describes the genetic events inhibiting apoptosis in DLBCL, provides a perspective of their interactions in lymphomagenesis, and discusses their implication for the future of DLBCL therapy.	2021	05	18	Cancers (Basel)	Leveille	Etienne
33955654	10.1111/jcmm.16558	Exosomes derived from MSC pre-treated with oridonin alleviates myocardial IR injury by suppressing apoptosis via regulating autophagy activation.	This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs)-derived exosomes in ischaemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced damage, and the role of oridonin in the treatment of IR. Exosomes were isolated from BMMSCs. Western blot analysis was done to examine the expression of proteins including CD63, CD8, apoptotic-linked gene product 2 interacting protein X (AliX), Beclin-1, ATG13, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf1) and Bcl2-associated X (Bax) in different treatment groups. Accordingly, the expression of CD63, CD81 and AliX was higher in BMMSCs-EXOs and IR + BMMSCs-EXOs + ORI groups compared with that in the BMMSCs group. And BMMSCs-derived exosomes inhibited the progression of IR-induced myocardial damage, while this protective effect was boosted by the pre-treatment with oridonin. Moreover, Beclin-1, ATG13 and Bcl-2 were significantly down-regulated while Apaf1 and Bax were significantly up-regulated in IR rats. And the presence of BMMSCs-derived exosomes partly alleviated IR-induced dysregulation of these proteins, while the oridonin pre-treatment boosted the effect of these BMMSCs-derived exosomes. The inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of H9c2 cells induced by hypoxia/reperfusion (HR) were mitigated by the administration of BMMSCs-derived exosomes. Meanwhile, HR also induced down-regulation of Beclin-1, ATG13 and Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of Apaf1 and Bax, which were mitigated by the administration of BMMSCs-derived exosomes. And oridonin pre-treatment boosted the effect of BMMSCs-derived exosomes. In conclusion, our results validated that BMMSCs-derived exosomes suppressed the IR-induced damages by participating in the autophagy process, while the pre-treatment with oridonin could boost the protective effect of BMMSCs-derived exosomes.	2021	10	01	J Cell Mol Med	Fu	Minghuan
33962620	10.1186/s12957-021-02216-3	A new pathological classification of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma according to protein expression of SSTR2 and Bcl2.	No universal classification method for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) has been reported based on the embryological origin of biliary epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to classify IHCC according to protein expression levels of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and b-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and to elucidate the clinicopathological features of each group. Fifty-two IHCC patients who underwent hepatic resection were enrolled in this study. Protein expression levels of SSTR2 and Bcl2 were examined using immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological factors were compared between the three groups and prognostic factors were investigated. The patients were divided into three groups: SSTR2 positive and Bcl2 negative (p-Group H, n = 21), SSTR2 negative and Bcl2 positive (p-Group P, n = 14), and the indeterminate group (p-Group U, n = 17) for cases where SSTR2 and Bcl2 were both positive or both negative. All p-Group P cases displayed curability A or B. The 5-year survival rates of p-Group H and U patients were worse than those in p-Group P. p-Group H had higher T-factor, clinical stage, and incidence of periductal infiltration than p-Group P. This method could be used to classify IHCC into peripheral and perihilar type by embryological expression patterns of SSTR2 and Bcl2.	2021	05	12	World J Surg Oncol	Yamashita	Shoko
33973992		Cryopreservation of Dog Spermatozoa Using Essential and Non-Essential Amino Acids Solutions in An Egg Yolk-Free Polyvinyl Alcohol Extender.	Amino acids (AAs) have been indicated to have cryoprotective and antioxidative effects on sperm freezing using egg yolk (EY)-based extender. However, EY-based extender is difficult to be standardized for the effect of amino acids because the EY composition varies with the animal's diet. To test the effect of AAs in EY-free polyvinyl alcohol (EY-free PVA) extender and develop a chemically defined extender for dog sperm cryopreservation. In the first experiment (E1), dog spermatozoa (1ｘ10<sup>8</sup> sperms/mL) were frozen with EY-free PVA extender without AAs or supplemented with essential (EAAs, 50 x: 1, 2, 4 %) or non-essential amino acids (NEAAs, 100 x: 1, 2, 4 %). In the second experiment (E2), spermatozoa were frozen with EY-free PVA extender supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1 or 2 % of an EAA-NEAA mixture. Motility, viability and acrosome integrity were evaluated after thawing in E1 and E2. In the third experiment (E3), spermatozoa were frozen using an extender supplemented with 2 % EAAs, 2 % NEAAs or a 0.5 % EAA-NEAA mixture. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation were assessed. Expression of genes for motility-related sperm mitochondrial-associated cysteine-rich protein (SMCP), apoptosis-related B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and BCL2 associated X protein (BAX) was measured. Addition of EAAs, NEAAs or an EAA-NEAA mixture to EY-free PVA extender significantly increased sperm motility without affecting viability. Only 1 % NEAAs significantly increased the acrosome membrane. EAA-NEAA mixture (0.5 %) significantly increased SMCP, BCL2 and BAX expression compared to the control group without significant effect on PS translocation or ROS. EAAs and NEAAs addition in EY-free PVA extender improved sperm motility, with limited effect on acrosome integrity and gene expression of SMCP, BCL2 and BAX during dog sperm cryopreservation.	2021	07	26	Cryo Letters	Talha	N A H
33974882	10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174167	Effects of trans-resveratrol on type 1 diabetes-induced up-regulation of apoptosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in retinal pigment epithelium of Dark Agouti rats.	Microvascular changes and retinal degeneration precede diabetic retinopathy. Oxidative stress alters several intracellular signaling pathways, which form the basis of diabetic retinopathy. Many antioxidants have been investigated as possible preventive and therapeutic remedies for diabetic retinopathy. The current study investigated the modulatory effects of trans-resveratrol on streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mediated changes in the transcription and levels of apoptosis-related proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of adult male dark Agouti rats. In control rats, 5 mg/kg/d trans-resveratrol administration for 30 days increased gene expressions of tumor suppressor protein 53, Bcl2-associated X protein, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), Caspase-3 (CASP3), CASP8 and CASP9, p38αMAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1). On the other hand, diabetes decreased gene expressions of CASP3, CASP8, p38αMAPK, JNK, and ERK1. Trans-resveratrol reversed the inhibited gene expressions of CASP8, p38αMAPK, JNK, and ERK1 to normal control levels in diabetic rats. Trans-resveratrol normalized diabetes-induced upregulation of CASP3 and -9, cytochrome-c, Bcl-2, and ERK1 proteins. In conclusion, Trans-resveratrol-induced alterations in gene expressions do not seem to affect RPE functions as they do not reflect as altered protein functions. Trans-resveratrol imparts its protective effects by normalizing apoptosis-related proteins and ERK1 but does not affect JNK proteins. Trans-resveratrol causes cytostasis in RPE of normal rats by upregulating Bcl2 protein and apoptotic proteins.	2021	11	05	Eur J Pharmacol	Al-Hussaini	Heba
33978190	10.1093/jn/nxab116	Dietary n-3 PUFA Deficiency Increases Vulnerability to Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Male C57BL/6 Mice.	DHA (22:6n-3), a long-chain n-3 PUFA, is essential for normal brain development and function. Our previous study demonstrated that DHA significantly improves scopolamine-induced dementia. However, there are no reports on the relation between n-3 PUFA deficiency and scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether n-3 PUFA deficiency increases vulnerability to scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. Male and female C57BL/6 mice were mated and fed an n-3 PUFA-adequate [containing 2.88% α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3)] or -deficient (containing 0.09% ALA) diet for 2 consecutive generations. The corresponding second-generation male offspring were kept on the same diet as their mothers after weaning, and were randomly assigned to 2 subgroups at 7 wk of age, in which they were intraperitoneally injected with saline [fed n-3 PUFA-adequate (Con) or -deficient (Def) diet] or scopolamine [5 mg/kg body weight; fed n-3 PUFA-adequate (Sco) or -deficient (Def + Sco) diet] once per day for 7 d before killing. Behavioral performance was analyzed using the Morris Water Maze test. Fatty acid composition, protein expression, and indicators of cholinergic and oxidative stress in the brain were measured. The Def group showed lower brain DHA (-63.7%, P ≤ 0.01) and higher n-6 PUFA (+65.5%, P ≤ 0.05) concentrations than the Con group. The Def + Sco group and the Sco group showed poorer spatial learning and memory (escape latency on the sixth day: +60.3% and +36.8%; platform crossings: -43.9% and -28.2%, respectively) and more obvious cholinergic dysfunction (acetylcholine: -47.6% and -27.7%, respectively), oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase: -64.2% and -32.5%, respectively), apoptosis [B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X protein/BCL2: +230.8% and +153.8%; phosphorylated P38/P38: +232% and +130%, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/JNK: +104.5% and +58.8%, respectively], neuroinflammation (IL-1β: +317.6% and +95%, respectively), and neurodevelopmental delay (brain-derived neurotrophic factor: -54.4% and -7.25%, respectively) than their corresponding saline-treated controls. Dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency significantly decreases brain DHA concentrations and increases vulnerability to scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in C57BL/6 male mice.	2022	01	28	J Nutr	Wang	Dan-Dan
33980772	10.1507/endocrj.EJ20-0739	Circular RNA circ_0000712 regulates high glucose-induced apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in (DN) by targeting the miR-879-5p/SOX6 axis.	Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a frequent diabetes complication, has complex pathogenesis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) circ_0000712 has been reported to be upregulated in kidney tissues and high glucose (HG)-inducted Mesangial cells (MCs). This study is designed to explore the role and mechanism of circ_0000712 in the HG-inducted MCs injury in DN. Circ_0000712, microRNA-879-5p (miR-879-5p), and SRY-Box Transcription Factor 6 (SOX6) levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry assay. Protein levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 related X protein (Bax), fibronectin (FN), collagen type I (Col. I), collagen type IV (Col. IV), and SOX6 were assessed by western blot assay. Levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity were detected by the corresponding kits. The binding relationship between miR-879-5p and circ_0000712 or SOX6 was predicted by starBase and Targetscan, and then verified by a dual-luciferase reporter and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Circ_0000712 and SOX6 were highly expressed, and miR-879-5p was decreased in db/db DN mice and HG-inducted SV40-MES13 cells. Furthermore, circ_0000712 deficiency repressed HG-caused apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in SV40-MES13 cells. Mechanically, circ_0000712 could regulate SOX6 expression by sponging miR-879-5p. Circ_0000712 knockdown could hinder HG-inducted SV40-MES13 cell injury through targeting the miR-879-5p/SOX6 axis, implying a possible circRNA-targeted therapy for DN.	2022	02	28	Endocr J	Zhao	Li

33997750	10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100276	Boosting mitochondria activity by silencing MCJ overcomes cholestasis-induced liver injury.	Mitochondria are the major organelles for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been described as a key factor in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease. The methylation-controlled J-protein (MCJ) is a mitochondrial protein that interacts with and represses the function of complex I of the electron transport chain. The relevance of MCJ in the pathology of cholestasis has not yet been explored. We studied the relationship between MCJ and cholestasis-induced liver injury in liver biopsies from patients with chronic cholestatic liver diseases, and in livers and primary hepatocytes obtained from WT and MCJ-KO mice. Bile duct ligation (BDL) was used as an animal model of cholestasis, and primary hepatocytes were treated with toxic doses of bile acids. We evaluated the effect of MCJ silencing for the treatment of cholestasis-induced liver injury. Elevated levels of MCJ were detected in the liver tissue of patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease when compared with normal liver tissue. Likewise, in mouse models, the hepatic levels of MCJ were increased. After BDL, MCJ-KO animals showed significantly decreased inflammation and apoptosis. In an <i>in vitro</i> model of bile-acid induced toxicity, we observed that the loss of MCJ protected mouse primary hepatocytes from bile acid-induced mitochondrial ROS overproduction and ATP depletion, enabling higher cell viability. Finally, the <i>in vivo</i> inhibition of the MCJ expression, following BDL, showed reduced liver injury and a mitigation of the main cholestatic characteristics. We demonstrated that MCJ is involved in the progression of cholestatic liver injury, and our results identified MCJ as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the liver injury caused by cholestasis. In this study, we examine the effect of mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition by MCJ on bile acid-induced liver toxicity. The loss of MCJ protects hepatocytes against apoptosis, mitochondrial ROS overproduction, and ATP depletion as a result of bile acid toxicity. Our results identify MCJ as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate liver injury in cholestatic liver diseases.	2022	04	23	JHEP Rep	Iruzubieta	Paula
34007050	10.1038/s41375-021-01291-5	MAPK-ERK is a central pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that drives steroid resistance.	(Patho-)physiological activation of the IL7-receptor (IL7R) signaling contributes to steroid resistance in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we show that activating IL7R pathway mutations and physiological IL7R signaling activate MAPK-ERK signaling, which provokes steroid resistance by phosphorylation of BIM. By mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that phosphorylated BIM is impaired in binding to BCL2, BCLXL and MCL1, shifting the apoptotic balance toward survival. Treatment with MEK inhibitors abolishes this inactivating phosphorylation of BIM and restores its interaction with anti-apoptotic BCL2-protein family members. Importantly, the MEK inhibitor selumetinib synergizes with steroids in both IL7-dependent and IL7-independent steroid resistant pediatric T-ALL PDX samples. Despite the anti-MAPK-ERK activity of ruxolitinib in IL7-induced signaling and JAK1 mutant cells, ruxolitinib only synergizes with steroid treatment in IL7-dependent steroid resistant PDX samples but not in IL7-independent steroid resistant PDX samples. Our study highlights the central role for MAPK-ERK signaling in steroid resistance in T-ALL patients, and demonstrates the broader application of MEK inhibitors over ruxolitinib to resensitize steroid-resistant T-ALL cells. These findings strongly support the enrollment of T-ALL patients in the current phase I/II SeluDex trial (NCT03705507) and contributes to the optimization and stratification of newly designed T-ALL treatment regimens.	2021	12	29	Leukemia	van der Zwet	Jordy C G
34007370	10.14740/jh818	<i>MYC</i>-Positive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in Leukemic Phase at Presentation: A Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in leukemic phase at presentation is a rare condition, and it can be challenging to differentiate from acute leukemia or other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. To obtain an accurate diagnosis immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analyses should be performed. Herein, we report a 54-year-old woman who experienced loss of consciousness and fever. Laboratory test results revealed leukocytosis, anemia, thrombopenia and hypercalcemia. Morphology of blood smear revealed two abnormal cell populations. However a specific diagnosis could not be made. Immunophenotyping showed two different populations, which was consistent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) showed <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> rearrangements. Finally a leukemic DLBCL was diagnosed and immediately treatment with rituximab cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) was started. Due to MYC-positivity, lenalidomide was added to the therapy regimen. After treatment the patient achieved complete remission without any clinical sequelae, which is still ongoing after 4 years. Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory drug that downregulates <i>MYC</i> gene and is commonly used in patients with multiple myeloma. Moreover, it can also be a promising therapeutic option for patients with <i>MYC</i>-positivity DLBCL presenting in leukemic phase.	2021	05	20	J Hematol	Bilgin	Yavuz Memis

We aimed to establish a predictive prognostic risk-stratification model for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the rituximab era. The data of 1406 primary DLBCL patients from the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center were analysed to establish a nomogram prognostic index (NPI) model for predicting overall survival (OS) based on pre-treatment indicators. An independent cohort of 954 DLBCL patients from three other hospitals was used for external validation. Age, performance status, stage, lactate dehydrogenase, number of extranodal sites, BCL2, CD5 expression, B symptoms and absolute lymphocyte and monocyte count were the main factors of the NPI model and could stratify the patients into four distinct categories based on their predicted OS. The calibration curve demonstrated satisfactory agreement between the predicted and actual 5-year OS of the patients. The concordance index of the NPI model (0.794) was higher than the IPI (0.759) and NCCN-IPI (0.750), and similar results were obtained upon external validation. For CD5 + DLBCL patients, systemic treatment with high-dose methotrexate was associated with superior OS compared to R-CHOP-based immunochemotherapy alone. We established and validated an accurate prediction model, which performed better than IPI and NCCN-IPI for prognostic stratification of DLBCL patients.	2021	12	10	Br J Cancer	Cai	Jun
34012594	10.21037/jtd-21-551	Anticancer mechanism of breviscapine in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells acts via ROS-mediated upregulation of IGFBP4.	The overall 5-year survival rate of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is less than 15% because of multiple drug resistance to chemotherapy and the limitations of early diagnosis. Thus, safe and effective drugs to treat NSCLC are required. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of breviscapine (BVP) on NSCLC cell apoptosis and proliferation, and to study its possible mechanisms. Using the NSCLC A549 cell line and BVP (0, 25, 50, and 100 µM), the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect A549 cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to assess cell apoptosis. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP4) levels was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and western blotting. Flow cytometry of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide was used to assess intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Western blotting was used to assess the levels of BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess <i>IGFBP4</i> mRNA expression. BVP induced apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, and increased ROS in A549 cells. Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed that BVP increased IGFBP4 protein and mRNA expressions in A549 cells. Compared with BVP treatment alone, IGFBP4 expression decreased in A549 cells treated with BVP and the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. IGFBP4 overexpression increased BVP-induced proliferation inhibition, while increasing BAX expression and decreasing BCL2 expression. Silencing IGFBP4 had the opposite effects. BVP could inhibit the growth of NSCLC A549 cells by promoting apoptosis via ROS-mediated upregulation of IGFBP4.	2022	04	23	J Thorac Dis	Wei	Weitian
34017010	10.1038/s41597-021-00915-w	DLBCL-Morph: Morphological features computed using deep learning for an annotated digital DLBCL image set.	Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Though histologically DLBCL shows varying morphologies, no morphologic features have been consistently demonstrated to correlate with prognosis. We present a morphologic analysis of histology sections from 209 DLBCL cases with associated clinical and cytogenetic data. Duplicate tissue core sections were arranged in tissue microarrays (TMAs), and replicate sections were stained with H&amp;E and immunohistochemical stains for CD10, BCL6, MUM1, BCL2, and MYC. The TMAs are accompanied by pathologist-annotated regions-of-interest (ROIs) that identify areas of tissue representative of DLBCL. We used a deep learning model to segment all tumor nuclei in the ROIs, and computed several geometric features for each segmented nucleus. We fit a Cox proportional hazards model to demonstrate the utility of these geometric features in predicting survival outcome, and found that it achieved a C-index (95% CI) of 0.635 (0.574,0.691). Our finding suggests that geometric features computed from tumor nuclei are of prognostic importance, and should be validated in prospective studies.	2021	08	02	Sci Data	Vrabac	Damir

MiR-429 was reported to be downregulated in contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). However, whether miR-429 is functionally relevant with CI-AKI needs further investigation. Human renal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2) cells were stimulated with contrast media iodixanol to establish <i>in vitro</i> CI-AKI model. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was applied to access cell viability. Flow cytometry was performed to determine apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to evaluate level of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) mRNA and miR-429 while western blot was applied to evaluate level of proteins including PDCD4, B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, p65, phosphorylated p65. Dual luciferase assay was used to validate miR-429 targeting PDCD4. MiR-429 was downregulated whereas PDCD4 was upregulated in contrast media iodixanol-stimulated HK-2 cells. MiR-429 overexpression elevated cell viability and attenuated cell apoptosis. Moreover, the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling was suppressed after miR-429 overexpression, while PDCD4 overexpression reversed these effects. MiR-429 directly targeted PDCD4 and negatively regulated its expression. CI-AKI induced NF-κB signalling activation and PDCD4 overexpression further promoted NF-κB signalling activation.

34031842	10.1007/s11064-021-03353-7	The Effect of NeuroAid (MLC901) on Cholestasis-Induced Spatial Memory Impairment with Respect to the Expression of BAX, BCL-2, BAD, PGC-1α and TFAM Genes in the Hippocampus of Male Wistar Rats.	Cholestasis is a bile flow reduction that is induced following Bile Duct Ligation (BDL). Cholestasis impairs memory and induces apoptosis. Apoptosis consists of two pathways: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic pathway is modulated by BCL-2 (B cell lymphoma-2) family proteins. BCL-2 (a pro-survival BCL-2 protein) has anti-apoptotic effect, while BAD (BCL-2-associated death) and BAX (BCL-2-associated X), the other members of BCL-2 family have pro-apoptotic effect. Furthermore, TFAM (mitochondrial transcriptional factor A) is involved in transcription and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA and PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α) is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. On the other hand, NeuroAid is a Traditional Chinese Medicine with neuroprotective and anti-apoptosis effects. In this study, we evaluated the effect of cholestasis on spatial memory and expression of BCL-2, BAD, BAX, TFAM, and PGC-1α in the hippocampus of rats. Additionally, we assessed the effect of NeuroAid on cholestasis-induced cognitive and genetic alterations. Cholestasis was induced by BDL surgery and NeuroAid was injected intraperitoneal at the dose of 0.4 mg/kg. Furthermore, spatial memory was evaluated using Morris Water Maze (MWM) apparatus. The results showed cholestasis impaired spatial memory, increased the expression of BAD and BAX, decreased the expression of TFAM and PGC-1α, and did not alter the expression of BCL-2. Also, NeuroAid decreased the expression of BAD and BAX and increased the expression of TFAM, PGC-1α, and BCL-2. In conclusion, cholestasis impaired spatial memory and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Also, cholestasis decreased the expression of TFAM and PGC-1α. Interestingly, NeuroAid restored the effects of cholestasis.	2021	10	18	Neurochem Res	Molaei	Pejman

Abnormal B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and interleukin-19 (IL-19) expression is closely related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. We aimed to determine whether <i>BCL2</i> polymorphisms and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of <i>IL19</i> are significantly associated with SLE susceptibility and if this is affected by synergism between <i>IL19</i> and <i>BCL2</i> genotypes. This observational cohort study randomly enrolled 150 patients with SLE and 150 healthy controls. Major <i>BCL2</i> and <i>IL19</i> allele and genotype distributions were examined in the two groups. The <i>IL19</i> SNP rs2243188 was determined using the TaqMan-MGB probe method. The synergistic effect between <i>BCL2</i> and <i>IL19</i> and clinical symptoms of SLE was also analyzed. The distribution of major <i>BCL2</i> genotypes and common <i>BCL2</i> alleles, especially for genotypes 191, 193, and 197, differed significantly between patients and controls. A significant difference in the dominant genetic model was also observed between groups, but not in the recessive model. The risk of disease in individuals who carried both 195-bp <i>BCL2</i> and 138-bp <i>IL19</i> susceptibility alleles was higher than in those carrying either allele alone. This preliminary study suggested that <i>BCL2</i> polymorphisms and the <i>IL19</i> SNP rs2243188 are closely related to the pathogenesis of SLE.	2021	05	31	J Int Med Res	Wang	Weijie
34046322		Cytotoxic effects of hydroalcoholic extract of <i>Cuscuta chinensis</i> on PC3 and MCF7 cancer cell lines.	Chemoprevention of cancer by application of natural phytochemical compounds has been used to prevent, delay or suppress cancer progression. <i>Cuscuta chinensis</i> a traditional Iranian medicinal herb, has biological properties including anticancer, anti-aging, immuno-stimulatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, anti-proliferative effects of hydroalcoholic extract of <i>C. chinensis</i> on prostate (PC3) and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines were investigated. In the current study, we investigated treatment of PC3 cells with different concentrations of <i>C. chinensis</i> (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 µg/ml) for 24 and 48 hr; also, MCF7 cells were treated with various concentrations (0-600 µg/ml) of <i>C. chinensis</i> for 48 and 72 hr and cell viability was assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. mRNA expression of BCL2 Associated X (<i>Bax</i>), B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>Bcl2</i>), Cysteine-aspartic proteases (<i>Caspase3</i>) and Phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>PTEN</i>) were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Annexin V/PI staining and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay were used to detect apoptosis. <i>C. chinensis</i> decreased PC3 and MCF7 cells viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p&lt;0.01 to p&lt;0.001). The gene expression of <i>BAX/Bcl2</i> ratio, <i>Caspase3</i> and <i>PTEN</i> increased in <i>C. chinensis</i>-treated cells compared to the control group. <i>C. chinensis</i> induced apoptosis (p&lt;0.001) and LDH activity (p&lt;0.01 to p&lt;0.001). Our findings suggest that <i>C. chinensis</i> extract is able to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in PC3 and MCF7 cell lines. Therefore, <i>C. chinensis</i> extract exerts antitumor activity against cancer cells.	2022	04	23	Avicenna J Phytomed	Karimi Dermani	Fatemeh
34051685	10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.109784	Differentiation between primary CNS lymphoma and atypical glioblastoma according to major genomic alterations using diffusion and susceptibility-weighted MR imaging.	We aimed to differentiate primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) from atypical glioblastoma (GB) and distinguish major genomic subtypes between these tumors using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) along with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Thirty-one immuno-competent patients with PCNSL stratified by BCL2 and MYC rearrangement, and 57 patients with atypical GB (no visible necrosis) grouped according to isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation status underwent 3.0-Tesla MRI before treatment in this retrospective study. Region of interest analysis with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and SWI signal intensity values of the tumors were normalized by dividing those of contralateral white matter. The independent-samples t-test and Kruskal-Wallis test were utilized to compare parameters. The diagnostic ability of each parameter and their optimal combination was evaluated by logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic. PCNSL with rearrangement of both MYC and BCL2 (n = 7) [mean relative (r) ADCmean:0.87 ± 0.06, rADCmin:0.72 ± 0.08] demonstrated significantly lower rADCmean, and rADCmin compared to other PCNSLs (n = 24) (rADCmean:1.19 ± 0.18, rADCmin:1.03 ± 0.17;p &lt; 0.001) and GBs (p &lt; 0.001). GB without IDH1 mutation (n = 44) (mean rSWI value:0.95 ± 0.15) demonstrated significantly lower rSWI value compared to GB with IDH1 mutation (n = 13) (rSWI value:1.13 ± 0.09;p &lt; 0.001) and PCNSL (p &lt; 0.001). The incorporation of rADCmean and rSWI parameters distinguished GB with IDH1 mutation [Area under the curve (AUC):0.985] with sensitivity and specificity of 94.3 and 100 % respectively; and PCNSL with rearrangement of both MYC and BCL2 (AUC:0.982) with sensitivity and specificity of 100 % and 95.4 %, respectively. CONCLUSıONS: Combined analysis of SWI and DWI could differentiate atypical GB from PCNSL and distinguish major genomic subtypes between these tumors.	2021	07	13	Eur J Radiol	Ozturk	Kerem
34059487	10.1016/j.clml.2021.04.004	A Real-life Turkish Experience of Venetoclax Treatment in High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.	Venetoclax is a selective B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor, which is approved to treat elderly patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in combination with either low-dose cytarabine (ARA-C) or hypomethylating agents. We aimed to collect and share data among the efficacy and safety of venetoclax both as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs used to treat high-risk MDS or AML. A total of 60 patients with a median age of 67 (30-83) years from 14 different centers were included in the final analysis. Thirty (50%) of the patients were women; 6 (10%) of the 60 patients were diagnosed with high-risk MDS and the remaining were diagnosed with AML. The best objective response rate (complete remission [CR], complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi), morphological leukemia-free state [MLFS], partial response [PR]) was 35% in the entire cohort. Best responses achieved during venetoclax per patient number were as follows: 7 CR, 1 CRi, 8 MLFS, 5 PR, and stable disease. Median overall survival achieved with venetoclax was 5 months in patients who relapsed and not achieved in patients who were initially treated with venetoclax. Nearly all patients (86.7%) had experienced a grade 2 or more hematologic toxicity. Some 36.7% of these patients had received granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) support. Infection, mainly pneumonia (26.7%), was the leading nonhematologic toxicity, and fatigue, diarrhea, and skin reactions were the others reported. Our real-life data support the use of venetoclax in patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed high-risk MDS and AML.	2022	01	28	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Gemici	Aliihsan
34060449		[Chronic venous disease increases placental villous angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and villous cell apoptosis].	Objective To investigate the changes of key factors such as placental villi and lymph vessels in chronic venous disease (CVD) during pregnancy. Methods According to the CEAP classification criteria, tissues of CVD patients were collected, and was divided into control group and CVD group. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect mRNA level of CD31, D2-4, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT-1), placental growth factor (PlGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) in placental tissues. Immohistochemical staining was performed to measure the expression level of CD31, D2-40, FLT-1, PlGF, HIF-1α, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-related X protein (BAX), caspase 3 and caspase-9. The change in average number of syncytiotrophoblast cell nodes in placental villi was observed by optical microscope and transmission electron microscope. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining was used to detect the PAS-positive substances in placental villi. Results Compared with the control group, the average numbers of placenta villi, syncytiotrophoblast cell nodes, syncytiotrophoblast cell nodes/villi and the connection bridges between villi of the average syncytrotrophoblast cells increased significantly in the CVD group, while the average number of fibrinoid necrosis showed no significant changes. The mRNA levels of CD31, D2-40, FLT-1, PlGF, and HIF-1α in the CVD group also increased significantly, and the proportion of villi cells positive of BAX, caspase-3 and caspase-9 rose significantly, while that of villi cells positive positive of Bcl2 showed no obvious change. CVD group also reported a marked increase in the number of blood vessels positive of CD31, D2-40, FLT-1 and PlGF. The expression level of HIF-1α in syncytiotrophoblast cells, cytotrophoblast cells and fetal capillary villi increased significantly in the CVD group. The percentage of placenta with PAS positive substances observed an increase in the villi, in comparison to the control group. Conclusion The production of blood vessels and lymph vessels increased in the placental villi of patients with CVD, coupled with an accelerated apoptosis of villi cells. Meanwhile, CVD patients show an impaired function of placental villi and obstructed gas exchange between mother and infant.	2021	06	02	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Wu	Haiyan
34061027	10.7554/eLife.67336	Contingency and chance erase necessity in the experimental evolution of ancestral proteins.	The roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in evolution are unresolved because they have never been assessed in a single system or on timescales relevant to historical evolution. We combined ancestral protein reconstruction and a new continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to acquire protein-protein interaction specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, we found that contingency generated over long historical timescales steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation; trajectories launched from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no common mutations, even under strong and identical selection pressures. Chance arose because many sets of mutations could alter specificity at any timepoint; contingency arose because historical substitutions changed these sets. Our results suggest that patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences - and likely other proteins, too - are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events. One of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in evolutionary biology is whether the outcomes of evolution are predictable. Is the diversity of life we see today the expected result of organisms adapting to their environment throughout history (also known as natural selection) or the product of random chance? Or did chance events early in history shape the paths that evolution could take next, determining the biological forms that emerged under natural selection much later? These questions are hard to study because evolution happened only once, long ago. To overcome this barrier, Xie, Pu, Metzger et al. developed an experimental approach that can evolve reconstructed ancestral proteins that existed deep in the past. Using this method, it is possible to replay evolution multiple times, from various historical starting points, under conditions similar to those that existed long ago. The end products of the evolutionary trajectories can then be compared to determine how predictable evolution actually is. Xie, Pu, Metzger et al. studied proteins belonging to the BCL-2 family, which originated some 800 million years ago. These proteins have diversified greatly over time in both their genetic sequences and their ability to bind to specific partner proteins called co-regulators. Xie, Pu, Metzger et al. synthesized BCL-2 proteins that existed at various times in the past. Each ancestral protein was then allowed to evolve repeatedly under natural selection to acquire the same co-regulator binding functions that evolved during history. At the end of each evolutionary trajectory, the genetic sequence of the resulting BCL-2 proteins was recorded. This revealed that the outcomes of evolution were almost completely unpredictable: trajectories initiated from the same ancestral protein produced proteins with very different sequences, and proteins launched from different ancestral starting points were even more dissimilar. Further experiments identified the mutations in each trajectory that caused changes in coregulator binding. When these mutations were introduced into other ancestral proteins, they did not yield the same change in function. This suggests that early chance events influenced each protein’s evolution in an unpredictable way by opening and closing the paths available to it in the future. This research expands our understanding of evolution on a molecular level whilst providing a new experimental approach for studying evolutionary drivers in more detail. The results suggest that BCL-2 proteins, in all their various forms, are unique products of a particular, unpredictable course of history set in motion by ancient chance events.	2021	10	19	Elife	Xie	Victoria Cochran

34097157	10.1007/s11864-021-00857-w	Novel Biological Insights and New Developments in Management of Burkitt Lymphoma and High-Grade B-Cell Lymphoma.	Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is highly curable, and prompt institution of therapy is critical to achieving optimal outcomes. Although current ""standard"" approaches are very effective in disease eradication, treatment-related toxicity makes optimal delivery of curative therapy a challenge, especially in older and immunocompromised individuals. Reduced intensity approaches with fewer toxic complications have been the focus of some recent studies. A critical question is if they can replace ""standard"" approaches by maintaining high curability with improved tolerability. Additionally, new molecular insights in BL biology suggest that in the future, ""targeted therapy"" approaches may be feasible using small molecule inhibitors and novel strategies. Recently, a new category of aggressive lymphoma named ""high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations"" has been recognized. This category overlaps clinically and biologically with BL and has an inferior prognosis compared to most B-cell lymphomas, and the optimal approach to its management remains, as yet, undefined. In this review, we discuss the current landscape of BL treatment including recent results with low-intensity regimens and also consider current approaches to HGBL. We also explore how recently elucidated novel biological insights in BL biology may shape future therapeutic directions including the use of novel cellular therapy approaches.	2022	01	31	Curr Treat Options Oncol	Lap	Coen J
34099597	10.4014/jmb.2102.02010	LINC01272 Suppressed Cell Multiplication and Induced Apoptosis Via Regulating MiR-7-5p/CRLS1 Axis in Lung Cancer.	LINC01272 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been considered as a biomarker for many diseases including lung squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we investigated the function and mechanism of LINC01272 on lung cancer (LC). The differential expression of LINC01272 in LC and normal samples was analyzed by GEPIA based on the data from TCGA-LUAD database, as survival prognosis was analyzed through Kaplan-Meier Plotter. LINC01272 overexpression plasmid and miR-7-5p mimic were transfected into A549 and PC-9 cells. LINC01272, miR-7-5p and cardiolipin synthase 1 (CRLS1) mRNA expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability was detected through MTT assay. Cell multiplication was evaluated by cell formation assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed through flow cytometry assay. Through bioinformatics, the target miRNA of LINC01272 and downstream genes of miR-7-5p were predicted. The targeting relationship was tested by dual luciferase reporter analysis. CRLS1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-associated X (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels were detected through western blot. LINC01272 was downregulated in LC and low LINC01272 expression had poor prognosis. In A549 and PC-9 cells, LINC01272 inhibited cell viability and multiplication and induced apoptosis. LINC01272 negatively regulated miR-7-5p and CRLS1 was a target of miR-7-5p. MiR-7-5p reversed the effect of LINC01272 on viability, multiplication, apoptosis and expression of miR-7-5p and CRLS1 as well as apoptosis-related factors (Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3). LINC01272 suppressed cell multiplication and induced apoptosis via regulating the miR-7-5p/CRLS1 axis in LC.	2021	11	09	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Ma	Xuan
34101913	10.1111/jop.13208	Prognostic significance of CD30 expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A systematic review with meta-analysis.	CD30 is variably expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but its prognostic potential for the affected patients remains debatable and unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the frequency of CD30 expression in DLBCL and its potential for prognostic determination. An electronic systematic review was performed using multiple databases, followed by a quantitative meta-analysis to assess the frequency of CD30 expression with positivity cut-off values of &gt;0% and &gt;20%, and to determine its association with clinicopathological features and patients' survival. Using a cut-off value &gt;0%, we observed that 3.5%-59.1% of the cases were considered positive for CD30. There was a significant association of the protein expression with a lower number of extra-nodal sites affected by the neoplasm, with Ann Arbor advanced stage, the absence of B-symptoms, the lack of MYC and BCL2 translocations, and a lower ECOG performance. Using a cut-off value &gt;20%, we observed that 2.5%-36.7% of the cases were considered positive for CD30, being significantly associated with a lower number of extra-nodal sites affected by the neoplasm, Ann Arbor stages III/IV, non-GCB tumours, the lack of MYC and BCL2 translocations, and a lower ECOG value. CD30 expression was significantly associated with a better survival rate, regardless of what cut-off parameter was used. Despite variations in the cut-off values used to determine CD30 positivity in DLBCL, the expression of this protein seems to be associated with a higher survival rate and better prognosis.	2021	07	19	J Oral Pathol Med	Rodrigues-Fernandes	Carla Isabelly
34105411	10.1177/15347354211021920	Antitumor and Radiosensitizing Effects of Zinc Oxide-Caffeic Acid Nanoparticles against Solid Ehrlich Carcinoma in Female Mice.	This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer and radio-sensitizing efficacy of Zinc Oxide-Caffeic Acid Nanoparticles (ZnO-CA NPs). ZnO-CA NPs were formulated by the conjugation of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) with caffeic acid (CA) that were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FT-IR), X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). In vitro anticancer potential of ZnO-CA NPs was evaluated by assessing cell viability in the human breast (MCF-7) and hepatocellular (HepG2) carcinoma cell lines. In vivo anticancer and radio-sensitizing effects of ZnO-CA NPs in solid Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice (EC mice) were also assessed. Treatment of EC mice with ZnO-CA NPs resulted in a considerable decline in tumor size and weight, down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) gene expressions, decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) level, downregulation of phosphorylated-extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (p-ERK1/2) protein expression, DNA fragmentation and a recognizable peak at sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> indicating dead cells' population in cancer tissues. Combined treatment of ZnO-CA NPs with γ-irradiation improved these effects. In conclusion: ZnO-CA NPs exhibit in-vitro as well as in-vivo antitumor activity, which is augmented by exposure of mice to γ-irradiation. Further explorations are warranted previous to clinical application of ZnO-CA NPs.	2021	10	11	Integr Cancer Ther	Sayed	Hayam M
34105893	10.1002/cam4.4062	Clinicopathological analysis of primary refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone chemoimmunotherapy.	Approximately 15% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) experience refractory or early relapsed disease after initial rituximab-containing chemoimmunotherapy is regarded as a primary refractory disease. Although the standard treatment for relapsed DLBCL is high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC-ASCT), the efficacy of this approach for primary refractory DLBCL is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of patients with primary refractory DLBCL. Sixty-nine consecutive patients with primary refractory DLBCL who were treated at our institution were categorized as partial responders (partial response to rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone [R-CHOP] or relapse within 6 months of R-CHOP) (n = 41) or primary progressors (no response to R-CHOP) (n = 28). Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. At initial diagnosis, 70% of patients had Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease, 56% had non-germinal center B-cell-like type DLBCL, and 42% had double-expressor lymphoma (MYC and BCL2 expression). The 3-year overall survival rate was significantly poorer in the primary progressors group than in the partial responders' group (15% vs. 48%, p &lt; 0.001). Four of 17 patients treated with HDC-ASCT were primary progressors; only one patient survived without relapse. Although double-expressor lymphoma status did not significantly impact overall survival among all patients (p = 0.794), it was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor in HDC-ASCT-treated patients (p = 0.002). We identified a subgroup of patients with primary refractory DLBCL who may not benefit from current treatment strategies. Further treatment development is needed to improve the outcomes of these patients.	2022	02	14	Cancer Med	Suzuki	Tomotaka

34107971	10.1186/s13018-021-02504-4	Raloxifene retards the progression of adjacent segmental intervertebral disc degeneration by inhibiting apoptosis of nucleus pulposus in ovariectomized rats.	Adjacent segmental intervertebral disk degeneration (ASDD) is a major complication secondary to lumbar fusion. Although ASSD pathogenesis remains unclear, the primary cause of intervertebral disk degeneration (IVDD) development is apoptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP). Raloxifene (RAL) could delay ASDD by inhibiting NP apoptosis. An ASDD rat model was established by ovariectomy (OVX) and posterolateral spinal fusion (PLF) on levels 4-5 of the lumbar vertebrae. Rats in the treatment groups were administered 1 mg/kg/d RAL by gavage for 12 weeks, following which, all animals were euthanized. Lumbar fusion, apoptosis, ASDD, and vertebrae micro-architecture were evaluated. RAL maintained intervertebral disk height (DHI), delayed vertebral osteoporosis, reduced histological score, and inhibited apoptosis. The OVX+PLF+RAL group revealed upregulated expression of aggrecan and B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl2), as well as significantly downregulated expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 (ADAMTS-4), metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), caspase-3, BCL2-associated X (bax), and transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) analysis revealed higher bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular number (Tb.N), and lower trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) in OVX+PLF+RAL group than in the OVX+PLF group. RAL can postpone ASDD development in OVX rats through inhibiting extracellular matrix metabolic imbalance, NP cell apoptosis, and vertebral osteoporosis. These findings showed RAL as a potential therapeutic target for ASDD.	2021	11	04	J Orthop Surg Res	Sun	Qi
34113336	10.3389/fimmu.2021.599493	<i>PiggyBac</i>-Generated CAR19-T Cells Plus Lenalidomide Cause Durable Complete Remission of Triple-Hit Refractory/Relapsed DLBCL: A Case Report.	MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple-hit lymphoma (THL) is an uncommon subset of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis. TP53 mutation is an independently poor progonistic indicator in patients with THL, hence novel therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor(CAR19)-T cell therapy has shown promising efficacy for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (RR DLBCL), but the majority of CAR19-T cell products to date have been manufactured using viral vectors. <i>PiggyBac</i> transposon system, with an inclination to memory T cells, offers a more convenient and economical alternative for transgene delivery. We herein report the first case of triple-hit RR DLBCL with TP53 mutation who was treated with <i>piggyBac-</i>generated CAR19-T cells and accompanied by grade 2 cytokine release syndrome. The patient obtained a complete remission (CR) in the 2nd month post-infusion and demanded maintenance therapy. Whether maintenance therapy is favorable and how to administrate it after CAR-T cell infusion remain controversial. Preclinical studies demonstrated that lenalidomide could enhance antitumor activity of CAR19-T cells. Therefore, we pioneered oral lenalidomide after CAR19-T therapy in the patient from the 4th month, and he discontinued after one cycle due to side effects. The patient has still kept sustained CR for over 24 months. Our case have firstly demonstrated the feasibility, preliminary safety and efficacy of <i>piggyBac</i>-produced CAR19-T cell therapy in triple-hit lymphoma. The innovative combination with lenalidomide warrants further investigation. Our findings shed new light on the possible solutions to improve short-term relapse after CAR19-T cell therapy in RR DLBCL. ChiCTR, number ChiCTR1800018111.	2021	06	23	Front Immunol	Li	Chenggong
34123811	10.3389/fonc.2021.656219	Case Report: Concurrent Occurrence of Abdominal Double Expressor Lymphoma and Jejunum Follicular Lymphoma.	Double expressor lymphoma (DEL), defined as overexpression of BCL2 and MYC, is an aggressive subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here we report a case of a 64-year-old female diagnosed with abdominal DEL transformed from jejunum follicular lymphoma (FL). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography showed diffuse accumulation of FDG into the peritoneum and small bowel wall. Double balloon-assisted enteroscopy revealed whitish submucosal tumors in the proximal jejunum. Aggregation of atypical lymphocytes positive for CD20, CD79a, and BCL2 was seen in the jejunal biopsy samples. These atypical lymphocytes were monoclonal since cell surface expression of Ig light chains was limited to κ chain by flow-cytometry. Thus, immunohistochemical and flowcytometric analyses data were consistent with FL of the jejunum. Neoplastic lymphocytes obtained from ascites were positive for CD10, CD20, CD79a, BCL2, and BCL6. Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) showed formation of <i>BCL2/IgH</i> fusion gene and extra copies of <i>MYC</i>, the former of which is a characteristic chromosomal abnormality of FL. These genetic alterations and protein expression profiles of ascitic fluid cells were consistent with those of DEL transformed from FL. Given that a significant population of patients with indolent FL of the gastrointestinal tract developed into aggressive DLBCL, it is likely that primary FL of the jejunum transformed into the abdominal aggressive DEL in this case. This case is unique in that concurrent occurrence of FL and DEL was confirmed by immunohistochemical and FISH analyses and that abdominal DEL transformed from jejunal FL was highly suspected.	2021	06	15	Front Oncol	Takada	Ryutaro
34139193	10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.06.004	Rictor/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 Signaling Protects Colonocytes from Apoptosis and Prevents Epithelial Barrier Breakdown.	Epithelial barrier impairment is a hallmark of several pathologic processes in the gut, including inflammatory bowel diseases. Several intracellular signals prevent apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells. Herein, we show that in colonocytes, rictor/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling is a prosurvival stimulus. Mechanistically, mTORC2 activates Akt, which, in turn, inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) associated agonist of cell death (Bad) and preventing caspase-3 activation. Nevertheless, during inflammation, rictor/mTORC2 signaling declines and Akt activity is reduced. Consequently, active caspase-3 increases in surface colonocytes undergoing apoptosis/anoikis and causes epithelial barrier breakdown. Likewise, Rictor ablation in intestinal epithelial cells interrupts mTORC2/Akt signaling and increases apoptosis/anoikis of surface colonocytes without affecting the crypt architecture. The increase in epithelial permeability induced by Rictor ablation produces a mild inflammatory response in the colonic mucosa, but minimally affects the development/establishment of colitis. The data identify a previously unknown mechanism by which rictor/mTORC2 signaling regulates apoptosis/anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells during colitis and clarify its role in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier.	2021	09	13	Am J Pathol	Castro-Martinez	Felipe
34151288	10.1038/s43018-020-00167-4	Network-based systems pharmacology reveals heterogeneity in LCK and BCL2 signaling and therapeutic sensitivity of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy, and novel therapeutics are much needed. Profiling patient leukemia' drug sensitivities <i>ex vivo</i>, we discovered that 44.4% of childhood and 16.7% of adult T-ALL cases exquisitely respond to dasatinib. Applying network-based systems pharmacology analyses to examine signal circuitry, we identified preTCR-LCK activation as the driver of dasatinib sensitivity, and T-ALL-specific LCK dependency was confirmed in genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Dasatinib-sensitive T-ALLs exhibited high BCL-XL and low BCL2 activity and venetoclax resistance. Discordant sensitivity of T-ALL to dasatinib and venetoclax is strongly correlated with T-cell differentiation, particularly with the dynamic shift in LCK vs. BCL2 activation. Finally, single-cell analysis identified leukemia heterogeneity in LCK and BCL2 signaling and T-cell maturation stage, consistent with dasatinib response. In conclusion, our results indicate that developmental arrest in T-ALL drives differential activation of preTCR-LCK and BCL2 signaling in this leukemia, providing unique opportunities for targeted therapy.	2022	04	19	Nat Cancer	Gocho	Yoshihiro
34159086	10.21037/tau-21-280	The protective effects of exogenous spermine on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.	To investigate the protective effects of exogenous spermine on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. (I) Different doses of spermine were injected into rats to determine the safe dose on the kidneys. Kidney toxicity was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of kidney tissue and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) in the venous blood. (II) A rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was established. Different doses of spermine were injected into the rats through the tail vein 30 minutes before and 3 days after the establishment of the model. Blood samples and kidney tissues were collected and renal injury was assessed via HE staining of the renal tissue, detection of apoptosis using the TUNEL assay, and detection of NGAL and KIM-1 in blood samples using ELISA. (III) Human HK-2 renal tubular epithelial cells were cultured under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions. To evaluate the protective effects of spermine, apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The mechanisms underlying the effects of spermine were studied using Western blot analyses. At spermine concentrations below 200 µM (2 mL/kg body weight), no significant damage to the kidney was observed by HE staining, and there was no significant difference in NGAL and KIM-1 levels between rats treated with spermine and control rats (P&lt;0.05). At spermine doses below 200 µM, HE staining showed that the degree of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was gradually alleviated with increasing doses of spermine. TUNEL assays demonstrated that spermine reduced the apoptosis of renal tissue, and increasing doses of spermine gradually decreased the levels of NGAL and KIM-1 in the blood compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). Western blot analysis revealed that spermine increased the expression of pro-caspase9, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), and decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax and cytochrome C compared to control cells. Exogenous spermine exerted a protective effect on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats by inhibiting the apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.	2022	04	24	Transl Androl Urol	Yan	Bo
34165702	10.1007/s12282-021-01266-5	Biology of primary breast cancer in older women beyond routine biomarkers.	There are numerous biomarkers which may have potential predictive and prognostic significance in breast cancer. This is extremely important in older adults, who may opt for less aggressive therapy. This work outlines the literature on biological assessment outside of standard biomarkers (defined as ER, PgR, HER2, Ki67) in women ≥ 65 years with primary operable invasive breast cancer, to determine which additional biomarkers are relevant to outcome in older women. Medline and Embase databases were searched. Studies were eligible if included ≥ 50 patients aged ≥ 65 years; stratified results by age; measured a biomarker outside of standard assay and reported patient data. A total of 12 studies were appraised involving 5000 patients, measuring 28 biomarkers. The studies were extremely varied in methodology and outcome but three themes emerged: 1. Differences in biomarker expression between younger and older women, indicating that breast cancer in older women is generally less aggressive compared to younger women; 2. Relationship of biomarker expression with survival, suggesting biomarkers which may exclusively predict response to primary treatment in older women; 3. Association of biomarker with chemotherapy, suggesting that older patients should not be declined chemotherapy based on age alone. There is evidence to support further investigation of B-cell lymphoma (BCL2), liver kinase (LK)B1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytoplasmic cyclin-E, mucin (MUC)1 and cytokeratins (CKs) as potential predictive or prognostic markers in older women with breast cancer undergoing surgery. Studies exploring these biomarkers in larger cohorts and in women undergoing non-operative therapies are required.	2022	01	10	Breast Cancer	Parks	R M
34166762	10.1016/j.neuroscience.2021.06.021	Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Deleted on Chromosome Ten Knockdown Attenuates Cognitive Deficits by Inhibiting Neuroinflammation in a Mouse Model of Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder.	Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a crucial regulator of neuronal development, neuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and synaptic plasticity. In this study we examined the potential role of PTEN in cognitive function in a mouse model of perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). Adult male C57BL/6J mice received intracerebroventricular injections of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PTEN or control siRNA 3 days prior to exploratory laparotomy (n = 8 per group). A group of healthy mice not undergoing surgery included as additional control. Barnes maze and fear conditioning tests were conducted 7 days after surgery. Mice were then sacrificed to examine the expression of PTEN, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (Iba)-1, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the hippocampus. The microglial activation was examined by immunohistochemistry using Iba-1 as a microglia maker. Nissl and terminal transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to measure cell death and apoptosis. In comparison to the healthy controls, surgically treated mice had longer latency to identify the target box in both training and testing sessions in the Barnes maze test and shorter freezing time in the fear conditioning test. Surgically treated mice had increased expression of PTEN, AMPK, Bax, IL-1β, and TNF-α, as well as increasing number of activated microglia and apoptosis neurons in the hippocampus. PTEN knockdown significantly attenuated the behavioral deficits in Barnes maze and fear conditioning tests, as well as over-expression of PTEN, AMPK, Bax, IL-1β, and TNF-α induced by surgery. PTEN knockdown could attenuate cognitive deficits induced by trauma, likely through inhibiting the activation of microglia.	2021	07	21	Neuroscience	Shen	Yanan
34171161	10.1111/pin.13131	Fluorescent nanoparticle-mediated semiquantitative MYC protein expression analysis in morphologically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification defines a new disease entity of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, making fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) screening for these genes mandatory. In addition, the prognostic significance of MYC expression was reported, with a cut-off value of 40%. However, interobserver discrepancies arise due to the heterogeneous intensity of MYC expression by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, a cut-off value of positivity for MYC protein in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) varies among studies at present. Here, we applied a high-sensitivity semiquantitative immunohistochemical technique using fluorescent nanoparticles called phosphor-integrated dots (PID) to evaluate the MYC expression in 50 de novo DLBCL cases, and compared it with the conventional diaminobenzidine (DAB)-developing system. The high MYC expression detected by the PID-mediated system predicted poor overall survival in DLBCL patients. However, we found no prognostic value of MYC protein expression for any cut-off value by the DAB-developing system, even if the intensity was considered. These results indicate that the precise evaluation of MYC protein expression can clarify the prognostic values in DLBCL, irrespective of MYC rearrangement.	2022	03	17	Pathol Int	Takayanagi	Natsuko
34174694	10.1016/j.jss.2021.05.004	Sulforaphane Ameliorates the Liver Injury of Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock Rats.	The protective effects of sulforaphane on liver injury induced by high-fat diet and sodium valproate were previously reported. The present study preliminarily investigated the effect of sulforaphane on liver injury induced by traumatic hemorrhagic shock. After a traumatic hemorrhagic shock model was established in rats, the survival of rats during the first 24 hours was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were measured using a biochemical analyzer or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cell apoptosis and histopathology of liver tissues were examined by TUNEL and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The mRNA and protein expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl2 associated X (Bax), Caspase-3, TNF-α, IL-1β, Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the liver tissues were determined by immunohistochemical staining, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Sulforaphane promoted the health of the animal, reduced liver cell apoptosis and ameliorated the histopathological damage in the liver of rats with traumatic hemorrhagic shock. Sulforaphane downregulated the expressions of liver function-related factors (ALT, AST, TB), inflammation-related factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, iNOS), and apoptosis-related factors (Bax, Caspase-3) and upregulated the expressions of factors related to apoptosis (Bcl-2) and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway (Nrf2, HO-1). Sulforaphane protected the liver against traumatic hemorrhagic shock through ameliorating the apoptosis and inflammation of the liver via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.	2022	04	06	J Surg Res	Guan	Zhihui
34176492	10.1186/s13256-021-02949-5	A young girl with chronic isolated cervical lymphadenopathy found to have lupus lymphadenopathy, progressing to develop lupus nephritis: a case report.	Systemic lupus erythematosus is a rare autoimmune disorder, with the prevalence in Asia ranging from 30 to 50/100,000. The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is made according to the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, and it does not contain lymphadenopathy as diagnostic criteria. However, lupus lymphadenopathy has an estimated prevalence of 5-7% at the onset of disease, and 12-15% at any stage of the disease. A 19-year-old Sinhalese girl had neck nodules since the age of 5 years, which increased in size and became tender since 1 year. She had alopecia and joint stiffness for 6 months. She presented with a 5-day history of worsening joint pain, fever, and painful, enlarging cervical nodules. She had tender cervical lymphadenopathy, and a vasculitic rash on both lower limbs. She had pancytopenia, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 92, positive antinuclear antibody titer, and high anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), with low C3 and C4 complements. She had a high reticulocyte count of 5%, with direct and indirect antiglobulin tests being positive, indicating autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Lymph node biopsy showed moderate reactive follicular hyperplasia, with scattered plasma cells and immunoblasts, with varying degree of coagulative necrosis, suggestive of lupus lymphadenopathy. On immunohistochemistry of the lymph node biopsy, Bcl2 was negative, excluding lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of abdomen and chest was normal with no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Later, with development of generalized edema, she was found to have impaired renal function, and renal biopsy showed lupus nephritis. She was started on hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil, and her symptoms improved and lymphadenopathy regressed. In the case of cervical lymphadenopathy in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, the possibilities of lupus lymphadenopathy, Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, and lymphoma should all be considered, after excluding secondary infection due to immunosuppression. Histology confirms the differentiation of these pathologies. It is important to differentiate the cause for lymphadenopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus as the outcome and treatment varies. Lupus lymphadenopathy is usually generalized, but isolated cervical lymphadenopathy could also rarely be the first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus lymphadenopathy can be the only presenting feature, and needs a high index in suspecting systemic lupus erythematosus, though it is not included in the diagnostic criteria.	2021	06	29	J Med Case Rep	Jayawickreme	K P
34178461	10.7717/peerj.11577	Expression of autophagy and apoptosis-related factors in the periodontal tissue of experimental diabetic rats: a histomorphometric, microtomographic and immunohistochemical study.	This study aimed to investigate the expression of autophagy-related factors microtubule-associated protein l light chain 3 (LC3) and the apoptosis-related factors BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in the periodontal tissue of experimental diabetic rats. These data were used to explore the potential mechanism in diabetes-induced periodontal tissue lesions. A total of 32 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into diabetes (group D, <i>n</i> = 16) and control groups (group N, <i>n</i> = 16). The diabetic group was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1% streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg) and the control group was injected with citrate buffer (0.1mol/L). Rats were sacrificed after 4 and 8 weeks of feeding and collected as D1, N1 groups and D2, N2 groups, and the maxilla were retained for analysis. The changes in periodontal tissue structure were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The expression and distribution of LC3, Bax and Bcl-2 in the periodontium of the rats was detected by immunohistochemical (SP) staining. Diabetic rats showed several changes compared to control animals including sparse alveolar bone trabecular structure, loss of the lamina dura and absorption of the local alveolar bone. The positive expression level of LC3 in the gingival epithelial, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone of group D1 was significantly higher than in the N1, N2 and D2 groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The level of Bax expression in the group D2 rats was significantly higher than those in the N1, N2 and D1 groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while the positive degree of Bcl-2 was significantly lower than those of other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). LC3 was negatively correlated with Bax and was irrelevant with Bcl-2; Bcl-2 was not correlated with Bax. The expression of LC3, Bax and Bcl-2 changes in the periodontal tissue of diabetic rats may indicate that autophagy and apoptotic are involved in the process of periodontal tissue damage in diabetic rats. These changes may be one of the mechanisms of periodontal tissue lesions.	2022	04	24	PeerJ	Mei	Youmin
34180401	10.14411/fp.2021.016	Toxoplasma gondii ROP17 promotes autophagy via the Bcl-2-Beclin 1 pathway.	The apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii (Nicolle et Manceaux, 1908) secretes a group of serine/threonine kinases from rhoptries, which play vital roles in boosting intracellular infection. Toxoplasma gondii rhoptry organelle protein 17 (ROP17) is one of these important kinase proteins. Nevertheless, its function remains unclear. Here, we showed that ROP17 induced autophagy in vitro and in vivo. The autophagy of small intestine tissues of T. gondii tachyzoite (RH strain)-infected mice was detected by the immunohistochemistry staining of LC3B, Beclin 1 and P62. ROP17 overexpression augmented starvation-induced autophagy in HEK 293T cells as measured by MDC staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. Moreover, the interaction of ROP17 and Bcl-2 was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and the data demonstrated that ROP17 had an autophagic role dependent on the Beclin 1-Bcl-2 pathway, which was also revealed in an in vivo model through immunohistochemical staining. Pearson coefficient analysis showed that there existed strong positive correlations between the expression of ROP17 and LC3B, Beclin 1 and phosphorylation of Bcl-2, while strong negative correlations between the expression of ROP17 and p62 and Bcl-2. Collectively, our findings indicate that ROP17 plays a pivotal role in maintaining T. gondii proliferation in host cells via the promotion of autophagy-dependent survival.	2021	09	28	Folia Parasitol (Praha)	Guo	Min
34185336	10.1002/ajh.26284	BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is significantly less effective in patients with hematologic malignancies.	Patients with hematologic malignancies have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Vaccination against COVID-19 is especially important in these patients, but whether they develop an immune response following vaccination is unknown. We studied serologic responses to the BNT162b2 vaccine in this population. A lower proportion of patients were seropositive following vaccination (75%) than in a comparison group (99%; p &lt; 0.001), and median (interquartile range [IQR]) antibody titers in patients were lower (90 [12.4-185.5] and 173 [133-232] AU/ml, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase, and number of treatment lines correlated with lower seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers, while absolute lymphocyte count, globulin level, and time from last treatment to vaccination correlated with higher seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had the lowest seropositivity rate followed by indolent lymphoma. Patients recently treated with chemo-immunotherapy, anti-CD20 antibodies, BCL2, BTK or JAK2 inhibitors had significantly less seropositive responses and lower median (IQR) antibody titers (29%, 1.9 [1.9-12] AU/ml; 0%, 1.9 [1.9-1.9] AU/ml; 25%, 1.9 [1.9-25] AU/ml; 40%, 1.9 [1.9-92.8] AU/ml; and 42%, 10.9 [5.7-66.4] AU/ml, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with hematologic malignancies is considerably impaired, and they could remain at risk for severe COVID-19 infection and death.	2021	09	22	Am J Hematol	Herzog Tzarfati	Katrin
34199936	10.3390/ijms22116084	Suppression of TRPV1/TRPM8/P2Y Nociceptors by Withametelin via Downregulating MAPK Signaling in Mouse Model of Vincristine-Induced Neuropathic Pain.	Vincristine (VCR) is a widely used chemotherapy drug that induced peripheral painful neuropathy. Yet, it still lacks an ideal therapeutic strategy. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, purinergic receptor (P2Y), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Withametelin (WMT), a potential Phytosteroid isolated from <i>datura innoxa</i>, exhibits remarkable neuroprotective properties. The present investigation was designed to explore the effect of withametelin on VCR-induced neuropathic pain and its underlying molecular mechanism. Initially, the neuroprotective potential of WMT was confirmed against hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced PC12 cells. To develop potential candidates for neuropathic pain treatment, a VCR-induced neuropathic pain model was established. Vincristine (75 μg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 10 consecutive days (day 1-10) for the induction of neuropathic pain. Gabapentin (GBP) (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and withametelin (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) treatments were given after the completion of VCR injection on the 11th day up to 21 days. The results revealed that WMT significantly reduced VCR-induced pain hypersensitivity, including mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia. It reversed the VCR-induced histopathological changes in the brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve. It inhibited VCR-induced changes in the biochemical composition of the myelin sheath of the sciatic nerve. It markedly downregulated the expression levels of TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1); TRPM8 (Transient receptor potential melastatin 8); and P2Y nociceptors and MAPKs signaling, including ERK (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun <i>N</i>-terminal kinase), and p-38 in the spinal cord. It suppressed apoptosis by regulating Bax (Bcl2-associated X-protein), Bcl-2 (B-cell-lymphoma-2), and Caspase-3 expression. It considerably attenuated inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity. This study suggests that WMT treatment suppressed vincristine-induced neuropathic pain by targeting the TRPV1/TRPM8/P2Y nociceptors and MAPK signaling.	2021	07	26	Int J Mol Sci	Khan	Adnan
34202528	10.3390/cancers13133155	Clinical Correlations of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 in Different Tumor Types.	PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex required to maintain transcriptional repression. The core PRC2 complex includes EZH2, SUZ12, and EED proteins and methylates histone H3K27. PRC2 is known to contribute to carcinogenesis and several small molecule inhibitors targeting PRC2 have been developed. The present study aimed to identify the cancer types in which PRC2 targeting drugs could be beneficial. We queried genomic and transcriptomic (cBioPortal, KMplot) database portals of clinical tumor samples to evaluate clinical correlations of PRC2 subunit genes. <i>EZH2</i>, <i>SUZ12</i>, and <i>EED</i> gene amplification was most frequently found in prostate cancer, whereas lymphoid malignancies (DLBCL) frequently showed <i>EZH2</i> mutations. In both cases, PRC2 alterations were associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, higher expression of PRC2 subunits was correlated with poor survival in renal and liver cancers as well as gliomas. Finally, we generated a Python application to analyze the correlation of <i>EZH2/SUZ12/EED</i> gene knockouts by CRISPR with the alterations detected in the cancer cell lines using DepMap data. As a result, we were able to identify mutations that correlated significantly with tumor cell sensitivity to PRC2 knockout, including SWI/SNF, COMPASS/COMPASS-like subunits and BCL2, warranting the investigation of these genes as potential markers of sensitivity to PRC2-targeting drugs.	2021	07	11	Cancers (Basel)	Erokhin	Maksim
34204385	10.3390/cancers13123032	Cell-Free Total Nucleic Acid-Based Genotyping of Aggressive Lymphoma: Comprehensive Analysis of Gene Fusions and Nucleotide Variants by Next-Generation Sequencing.	Chromosomal translocations and pathogenic nucleotide variants both gained special clinical importance in lymphoma diagnostics. Non-invasive genotyping from peripheral blood (PB) circulating free nucleic acid has been effectively used to demonstrate cancer-related nucleotide variants, while gene fusions were not covered in the past. Our prospective study aimed to isolate and quantify PB cell-free total nucleic acid (cfTNA) from patients diagnosed with aggressive lymphoma and to compare with tumor-derived RNA (tdRNA) from the tissue sample of the same patients for both gene fusion and nucleotide variant testing. Matched samples from 24 patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing following anchored multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (AMP) for 125 gene regions. Eight different gene fusions, including the classical <i>BCL2</i>, <i>BCL6</i>, and <i>MYC</i> genes, were detected in the corresponding tissue biopsy and cfTNA specimens with generally good agreement. Synchronous <i>BCL2</i> and <i>MYC</i> translocations in double-hit high-grade B-cell lymphomas were obvious from cfTNA. Besides, mutations of 29 commonly affected genes, such as <i>BCL2</i>, <i>MYD88</i>, <i>NOTCH2</i>, <i>EZH2</i>, and <i>CD79B</i>, could be identified in matched cfTNA, and previously described pathogenic variants were detected in 16/24 cases (66.7%). In 3/24 cases (12.5%), only the PB sample was informative. Our prospective study demonstrates a non-invasive approach to identify frequent gene fusions and variants in aggressive lymphomas. cfTNA was found to be a high-value representative reflecting the complexity of the lymphoma aberration landscape.	2021	07	05	Cancers (Basel)	Mokánszki	Attila
34210682	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0553	Network Analysis Reveals Synergistic Genetic Dependencies for Rational Combination Therapy in Philadelphia Chromosome-Like Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Systems biology approaches can identify critical targets in complex cancer signaling networks to inform new therapy combinations that may overcome conventional treatment resistance. We performed integrated analysis of 1,046 childhood B-ALL cases and developed a data-driven network controllability-based approach to identify synergistic key regulator targets in Philadelphia chromosome-like B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like B-ALL), a common high-risk leukemia subtype associated with hyperactive signal transduction and chemoresistance. We identified 14 dysregulated network nodes in Ph-like ALL involved in aberrant JAK/STAT, Ras/MAPK, and apoptosis pathways and other critical processes. Genetic cotargeting of the synergistic key regulator pair <i>STAT5B</i> and <i>BCL2-</i>associated athanogene 1 (<i>BAG1</i>) significantly reduced leukemia cell viability <i>in vitro</i>. Pharmacologic inhibition with dual small molecule inhibitor therapy targeting this pair of key nodes further demonstrated enhanced antileukemia efficacy of combining the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ruxolitinib or dasatinib <i>in vitro</i> in human Ph-like ALL cell lines and <i>in vivo</i> in multiple childhood Ph-like ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Consistent with network controllability theory, co-inhibitor treatment also shifted the transcriptomic state of Ph-like ALL cells to become less like kinase-activated <i>BCR-ABL1</i>-rearranged (Ph+) B-ALL and more similar to prognostically favorable childhood B-ALL subtypes. Our study represents a powerful conceptual framework for combinatorial drug discovery based on systematic interrogation of synergistic vulnerability pathways with pharmacologic inhibitor validation in preclinical human leukemia models.	2022	01	14	Clin Cancer Res	Ding	Yang-Yang
34219464	10.1139/bcb-2021-0045	Isovitexin attenuates tumor growth in human colon cancer cells through the modulation of apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	Isovitexin, a biologically active flavone C-glycosylated derivative, has a variety of biological activities. We aimed to identify the effect of isovitexin (Isov) on colon cancer. Human colonic epithelial cells (HCECs) and cancer cells were treated with Isov and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) was used to detect cell proliferation and calculate the half-inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>). The biological activity of cancer cells was assessed. The tumor size and volume were recorded. Protein expression levels were analyzed by western blotting. Isov inhibited cancer cell proliferation but had little cytotoxicity on HCECs. Isov significantly attenuated cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and induced cell apoptosis., This trend was blocked by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) treatment. The expression levels of phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinasep (p-PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) decreased when treated with Isov, while the levels of Bcl2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3 significantly increased. After Isov treatment, the tumor volume and weight were decreased, and the levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR, and Bcl-2 significantly decreased in tumor tissues. Our findings demonstrated that Isov inhibited cancer cell migration, invasion, and EMT. Isov may be a new potential treatment for colon cancer.	2022	01	13	Biochem Cell Biol	Zhu	Hao

Our previous research found that A-DLBCL displays many genetic alterations and biological features that differ greatly from those of ordinary DLBCL. However, the status of tumor immune microenvironment components and checkpoint molecules in A-DLBCL remains unclear. Thirty A-DLBCL patients were enrolled to study tumor immune microenvironment components and checkpoint molecules and their associations with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Patients with A-DLBCL presented higher expression of PD-L1 (40% <i>vs</i> 10%, P=0.004) than patients with ordinary DLBCL. FISH analysis showed that extra copies of PD-L1 were more frequent in A-DLBCL cases than in ordinary DLBCL cases (23.3% <i>vs</i> 4.0%, P=0.001). The numbers of PD-1<sup>+</sup> TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells were significantly lower in A-DLBCL versus ordinary DLBCL. In contrast, the numbers of GATA3<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells, FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and CD33<sup>+</sup> myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were significantly higher in A-DLBCL than in ordinary DLBCL. The associations between clinicopathological features and tumor immune microenvironment cell frequency were analyzed in A-DLBCL patients. Briefly, the number of PD-1<sup>+</sup> TILs was lower and the number of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs was higher in patients with mutated <i>TP53</i> compared to those with wild-type <i>TP53</i>. The number of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs was much lower in patients with a noncomplete response (CR) to chemotherapy than in those with a complete response. The number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed a decreasing trend in patients with high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores and in those with concurrent MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 abnormalities. Univariate survival analysis showed that patients with PD-L1<sup>+</sup>, mPD-L1<sup>+</sup>(PD-L1<sup>+</sup> nonmalignant stromal cells) or mPD-L1<sup>+</sup> status had a significantly poorer overall survival (OS) than those with PD-L1<sup>-</sup> status. An increase in the number of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells and T-bet<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells was significantly associated with prolonged OS in patients with A-DLBCL. Our study suggests that A-DLBCL displays a distinct pattern of tumor immune microenvironment components and checkpoint molecules that distinguish it from ordinary DLBCL. The analysis of tumor immune microenvironment components and checkpoint molecules could help in predicting the prognosis of A-DLBCL patients and determining therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor immune microenvironment.	2022	04	24	Front Oncol	Xu	Tianqi
34224392	10.1530/REP-21-0157	PIWIs maintain testis apoptosis to remove abnormal germ cells in Eriocheir sinensis.	PIWI proteins play important roles in germline development in the mammals. However, the functions of PIWIs in crustaceans remain unknown. In the present study, we identified three Piwis from the testis of Eriocheir sinensis (E. sinensis). Three Piwi genes encoded proteins with typical features of PIWI subfamilies and were highly expressed in the testis. Three PIWIs could be detected in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and spermatids, while in spermatozoa, we could only detect PIWI1 and PIWI3 in the nucleus. The knockdown of PIWIs by dsRNA significantly affected the formation of the nuclei in spermatozoa, which resulted in deviant and irregular nuclei. PIWI defects significantly inhibited the apoptosis of abnormal germ cells through the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway and p53 pathway. Knockdown of PIWIs inhibited the expression of caspase (Casp) 3, 7, 8, and p53 without affecting Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma gene 2), Bax (B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X), and BaxI (B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X inhibitor), which further significantly increased abnormal spermatozoa in the knockdown-group crabs. These results show a new role of PIWI proteins in crustaceans that is different from that in mammals. In summary, PIWIs play roles in the formation of the germline nucleus and can maintain apoptosis in abnormal germ cells to remove abnormal germ cells in E. sinensis.	2022	03	11	Reproduction	Wei	Bang-Hong
34226167	10.1016/j.clml.2021.05.018	Novel Therapeutic Approaches in Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN): Era of Targeted Therapy.	Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematologic malignancy arising from the aberrant transformation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and involving skin, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and central nervous system. Characteristically unique from other myeloid neoplasms, BPDCN cells express CD4, CD56, and CD123 as well as TCL-1 and TCF4 in almost all cases. Historically, this malignancy has exhibited a poor prognosis, with median survival of less than 2 years. Traditional treatment approaches have involved conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; however, patients frequently relapse with chemotherapy-resistant disease. We have recently entered a modern era of therapy with targeting of CD123, with first-in-class agent tagraxofusp, a CD123- targeted agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for therapy of patients with BPDCN ages 2 and older. Relapsed and refractory BPDCN remains an elusive therapeutic challenge, but better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology has led to the development of other CD123-targeted agents and combination therapy, as well as agents targeting beyond CD123. Specifically, the use of venetoclax in targeting BCL2 has been promising in BPDCN treatment. This review will focus on the underlying diagnostic markers of BPDCN which have led to novel targeted treatment strategies, as well as future directions in therapy we can expect in coming years.	2022	02	16	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Wilson	Nathaniel R
34243771	10.1186/s12958-021-00791-4	Characterization of the effects of heat stress on autophagy induction in the pig oocyte.	Heat stress (HS) occurs when body heat accumulation exceeds heat dissipation and is associated with swine seasonal infertility. HS contributes to compromised oocyte integrity and reduced embryo development. Autophagy is a potential mechanism for the oocyte to mitigate the detrimental effects of HS by recycling damaged cellular components. To characterize the effect of HS on autophagy in oocyte maturation, we utilized an in vitro maturation (IVM) system where oocytes underwent thermal neutral (TN) conditions throughout the entire maturation period (TN/TN), HS conditions during the first half of IVM (HS/TN), or HS conditions during the second half of IVM (TN/HS). To determine the effect of HS on autophagy induction within the oocyte, we compared the relative abundance and localization of autophagy-related proteins. Heat stress treatment affected the abundance of two well described markers of autophagy induction: autophagy related gene 12 (ATG12) in complex with ATG5 and the cleaved form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B-II). The HS/TN IVM treatment increased the abundance of the ATG12-ATG5 complex and exacerbated the loss of LC3B-II in oocytes. The B-cell lymphoma 2 like 1 protein (BCL2L1) can inhibit autophagy or apoptosis through its interaction with either beclin1 (BECN1) or BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX), respectively. We detected colocalization of BCL2L1 with BAX but not BCL2L1 with BECN1, suggesting that apoptosis is inhibited under the HS/TN treatment but not autophagy. Interestingly, low doses of the autophagy inducer, rapamycin, increased oocyte maturation. Our results here suggest that HS increases autophagy induction in the oocyte during IVM, and that artificial induction of autophagy increases the maturation rate of oocytes during IVM. These data support autophagy as a potential mechanism activated in the oocyte during HS to recycle damaged cellular components and maintain developmental competence.	2021	12	31	Reprod Biol Endocrinol	Hale	Benjamin J
34251414	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004233	Phase 3 randomized trial of chemotherapy with or without oblimersen in older AML patients: CALGB 10201 (Alliance).	Overexpression of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) renders acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells resistant to chemotherapy and has been associated with unfavorable outcomes. Oblimersen (G3139) is a phosphorothioate 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide directed against the first 6 BCL2 codons. In a phase 1 study of AML patients treated with G3139, cytarabine, and daunorubicin induction with cytarabine consolidation, no antisense-related toxicity was reported, and BCL2 downregulation occurred in patients achieving complete remission. In this phase 3 trial, untreated older AML patients were randomized to cytarabine (100 mg/m2 per day on days 4-10) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per day on days 4-6) followed by cytarabine consolidation (2000 mg/m2 per day on days 4-8) with (arm A) or without (arm B) G3139 (7 mg/m2 per day on days 1-10 [induction] or days 1-8 [consolidation]). A total of 506 patients were enrolled. No differences in toxicity were observed between arms. Estimated overall survival (OS) at 1 year was 43% for arm A and 40% for arm B (1-sided log rank P = .13), with no differences in disease-free (DFS; P = .26) or event-free survival (P = .80). Subgroup analyses showed patients age &lt;70 years in arm A had improved OS by 1 month vs those in arm B (P = .04), and patients with secondary AML in arm A had better DFS vs those in arm B (P = .04). We conclude that addition of G3139 to chemotherapy failed to improve outcomes of older AML patients. However, more effective means of inhibiting BCL2 are showing promising results in combination with chemotherapy in AML. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00085124.	2021	07	22	Blood Adv	Walker	Alison R
34259934	10.1007/s12032-021-01513-x	Computational study on novel natural inhibitors targeting BCL2.	Ideal lead compounds and candidate drugs with inhibitory effect on BCL2 were screened from ZINC database, which laid a foundation for drug development and compound improvement of drug treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL). Identification of potential BCL2 inhibitors by computer-aided virtual screening. Libdock was applied to 17,931 compounds and the top 20 were selected for further analysis. Selected compounds were performed absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and toxicity prediction. The binding affinity between the selected ligands and BCL2 was confirmed by Molecular docking. The new natural compounds, ZINC00000255131 and ZINC00013298233, were found to bind closely with BCL2. Furthermore, they all scored lower in ames-induced mutagenicity, rodent carcinogenicity, non-developmental toxicity potential, and cytochrome P4502D6 tolerance. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the combinations of ZINC00000255131 and ZINC00013298233 with BCL2 in the natural environment are more stable. Two new compounds, ZINC00000255131 and ZINC00013298233, were found to be potential inhibitors of BCL2. These compounds have been proved to be safe, which is of great significance for the development and improvement of DLCBL drugs.	2021	12	27	Med Oncol	Lv	Xiaye
34269703	10.1097/FJC.0000000000001031	Circ-PRKCI Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-induced Human Kidney 2 Cell Injury by Regulating miR-106b-5p/GAB1 Axis.	Circular RNAs act as vital regulators in diverse diseases. However, the investigation of circular RNAs in sepsis-engendered acute kidney injury remains dismal. We aimed to explore the effects of circular RNA protein kinase C iota (circ-PRKCI) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated HK2 cell injury. Sepsis in vitro model was established by LPS treatment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was conducted for determining the levels of circ-PRKCI, microRNA-106b-5p (miR-106b-5p), and growth factor receptor binding 2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1). Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The concentrations of interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The levels of oxidative stress markers were determined using relevant commercial kits. Western blot assay was conducted for B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-Associated X (Bax), and GAB1 protein levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were used to verify the association between miR-106b-5p and circ-PRKCI or GAB1. We found the Circ-PRKCI level was decreased in sepsis patients and LPS-induced human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells. LPS exposure inhibited cell viability and facilitated apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in HK-2 cells. Circ-PRKCI overexpression abrogated the effects of LPS on cell apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, circ-PRKCI was identified as the sponge for miR-106b-5p to positively regulate GAB1 expression. Overexpression of circ-PRKCI relieved LPS-mediated HK-2 cell damage by sponging miR-106b-5p. MiR-106b-5p inhibition ameliorated the injury of HK-2 cells mediated by LPS, whereas GAB1 knockdown reversed the effect. Collectively, Circ-PRKCI overexpression attenuated LPS-induced HK-2 cell injury by regulating miR-106b-5p/GAB1 axis.	2022	02	11	J Cardiovasc Pharmacol	Xiong	Yueli
34272731	10.1111/bjh.17708	EBV-positive HIV-associated diffuse large B cell lymphomas are characterized by JAK/STAT (STAT3) pathway mutations and unique clinicopathologic features.	Even in the era of highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), patients with HIV have a disproportionate risk of developing aggressive lymphomas that are frequently Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related. Here, we investigate HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (HIV-DLBCL) and compare EBV-positive and EBV-negative cases. HIV-DLBCL were identified from two academic medical centres and characterised by immunohistochemistry, EBV status, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, cell of origin determination by gene expression profiling, and targeted deep sequencing using a custom mutation panel of 334 genes. We also applied the Lymphgen tool to determine the genetic subtype of each case. Thirty HIV-DLBCL were identified, with a median patient age of 46 years and male predominance (5:1). Thirteen cases (48%) were EBV-positive and 14 (52%) EBV-negative. Nine of the 16 tested cases (56%) had MYC rearrangement, three (19%) had BCL6 (two of which were double hit MYC/BCL6) and none had BCL2 rearrangements. Using the Lymphgen tool, half of the cases (15) were classified as other. All HIV-DLBCL showed mutational abnormalities, the most frequent being TP53 (37%), MYC (30%), STAT3 (27%), HIST1H1E (23%), EP300 (20%), TET2 (20%), SOCS1 (17%) and SGK1 (17%). EBV-negative cases were mostly of germinal centre B-cell (GCB) origin (62%), showed more frequent mutations per case (a median of 13·5/case) and significant enrichment of TP53 (57% vs. 15%; P = 0·046), SGK1 (36% vs. 0%; P = 0·04), EP300 (43% vs. 0%; P = 0·02) and histone-modifying gene (e.g. HIST1H1E, HIST1H1D, 79% vs. 31%; P = 0·02) mutations. EBV-positive cases were mostly of non-GCB origin (70%), with fewer mutations per case (median 8/case; P = 0·007), and these tumours were enriched for STAT3 mutations (P = 0·10). EBV-positive cases had a higher frequency of MYC mutations but the difference was not significant (36% vs. 15%; P = 0·38). EBV-association was more frequent in HIV-DLBCLs, arising in patients with lower CD4 counts at diagnosis (median 46·5 vs. 101, P = 0·018). In the era of cART, approximately half of HIV-DLBCL are EBV-related. HIV-DLBCL are enriched for MYC rearrangements, MYC mutations and generally lack BCL2 rearrangements, regardless of EBV status. Among HIV-DLBCL, tumours that are EBV-negative and EBV-positive appear to have important differences, the latter arising in context of lower CD4 count, showing frequent non-GCB origin, lower mutation burden and recurrent STAT3 mutations.	2021	12	15	Br J Haematol	Chapman	Jennifer R
34276389	10.3389/fphys.2021.603848	Expression of Autophagy-Related Factors LC3A and Beclin 1 and Apoptosis-Related Factors Bcl-2 and BAX in Osteoblasts Treated With Sodium Fluoride.	This study aims to analyze the expressions of autophagy-related factors light chain 3 alpha (LC3A) and Beclin 1 and apoptosis-related factors B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) in primary osteoblasts treated with sodium fluoride (NaF). Osteoblasts were extracted from Sprague-Dawley rats and treated with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/L NaF solutions, followed by 10 mmol/L 3-methyladenine (3-MA) for 24 h. The apoptotic rate was determined by flow cytometry, and the expressions of the autophagy- and apoptosis-related factors were measured by western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA expressions of LC3A, Beclin 1, and BAX in the NaF-treated osteoblast group were higher than those in the control group, while the protein expressions of these factors in the NaF-treated group were significantly higher than those in the control group. However, the Bcl-2 protein expression in the NaF-treated osteoblasts was significantly decreased compared to that in the control cells. After the 3-MA treatment, the protein expressions of LC3A, Beclin 1, and Bcl-2 were significantly decreased compared with those of the NaF-treated group, whereas the expression of BAX increased. Moreover, the apoptosis rate was increased after the addition of the 3-MA inhibitor. NaF stimulation promoted autophagy and apoptosis of the osteoblasts, suggesting the involvement of fluoride damage in these processes.	2022	04	24	Front Physiol	Xu	Lin
34277781	10.21037/atm-21-2574	A novel peptide promotes human trophoblast proliferation and migration through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	Preeclampsia (PE) is a complex pregnancy-related disease that endangers the safety of maternal and fetal. The purpose of this study is to reveal the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and discover new predictors from the perspective of peptidomics. The umbilical cord blood of PE and control group was analyzed by peptidomics. A peptide named Regulation of Proliferation Process in Preeclampsia (ROPPIP) was screened out to explore its role in the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of trophoblast cells in preeclampsia. We compared and analyzed the umbilical cord blood of patients with PE and normal pregnant women using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). hTR-8/Svneo cells cultured <i>in vitro</i> were divided into ROPPIP group and a disordered peptide group as control. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, Transwell chamber assays and western blot analysis were performed to detect cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis, in addition to the expression of Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), nuclear associated antigen Ki67, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), Caspase 3, and β-actin protein. We identified 133 differential peptides. Of these, 51 were up-regulated while 82 were down-regulated. the polypeptide SFGVRMATASPTDGNV with low differential expression in the serum of PE patients was selected for the study, we named the polypeptide as Regulation of Proliferation Process in PE (ROPPIP). The experiment shows that ROPPIP can up-regulate the expression levels of MMP2, Ki67, and Bcl2 in HTR-8/Svneo cells, down-regulate the expression of caspase-3, promote the proliferation and migration of HTR-8/Svneo cells and inhibit the apoptosis induced by cisplatin, the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathway may be associated with the function of ROPPIP. ROPPIP promotes HTR-8/Svneo cells migration and proliferation, and inhibits apoptosis, by regulating the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.	2022	04	24	Ann Transl Med	Ling	Li
34282785	10.3390/cancers13133367	Potent Anticancer Effects of Epidithiodiketopiperazine NT1721 in Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma.	Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of debilitating, incurable malignancies. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most common subtypes, accounting for ~65% of CTCL cases. Patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis and low median survival rates of four years. CTCLs develop from malignant skin-homing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that spread to lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow and viscera in advanced stages. Current treatments options for refractory or advanced CTCL, including chemotherapeutic and biological approaches, rarely lead to durable responses. The exact molecular mechanisms of CTCL pathology remain unclear despite numerous genomic and gene expression profile studies. However, apoptosis resistance is thought to play a major role in the accumulation of malignant T cells. Here we show that NT1721, a synthetic epidithiodiketopiperazine based on a natural product, reduced cell viability at nanomolar concentrations in CTCL cell lines, while largely sparing normal CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Treatment of CTCL cells with NT1721 reduced proliferation and potently induced apoptosis. NT1721 mediated the downregulation of GLI1 transcription factor, which was associated with decreased STAT3 activation and the reduced expression of downstream antiapoptotic proteins (BCL2 and BCL-xL). Importantly, NT1721, which is orally available, reduced tumor growth in two CTCL mouse models significantly better than two clinically used drugs (romidepsin, gemcitabine). Moreover, a combination of NT1721 with gemcitabine reduced the tumor growth significantly better than the single drugs. Taken together, these results suggest that NT1721 may be a promising new agent for the treatment of CTCLs.	2022	03	17	Cancers (Basel)	Lin	Min
34282799	10.3390/cancers13133369	The Incidence and Treatment Response of Double Expression of MYC and BCL2 in Patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	MYC/BCL2 protein co-expression (i.e., double expressor) has been shown to be a negative predictor of outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We aimed to establish the incidence of double expressor status in patients with de novo DLBCL and identify the predictive value of this biomarker on treatment response through systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed and Embase were searched for studies published through December 2019 that reported proportions of double expressor DLBCL. The pooled proportions of MYC and BCL2 expression, both alone and in combination, were computed using the inverse variance method for calculating weights and by the DerSimonian-Laird method. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of complete remission (CR) rate were calculated, and meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore heterogeneity. Forty-one studies (7054 patients) were included. The pooled incidence of double expressor status in DLBCL was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20-26%), with an adjusted estimate of 31% (95% CI, 27-36%). Neither MYC/BCL2 protein cutoff values, race, mean, or median age of included patients, or overall study quality was a significant factor of heterogeneity (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.20). Cases without double expressor status demonstrated a higher probability of CR to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone treatment (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.55-4.67). Our results reaffirm the predictive power of this important biomarker.	2021	07	23	Cancers (Basel)	Hwang	Jisun
34284777	10.1186/s12958-021-00799-w	Effects of low intensity pulsed ultrasound on expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 and BCL2-Associated X in premature ovarian failure mice induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide.	Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a common disease in the field of Gynecology. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can promote tissue repair and improve function. This study was performed to determine the effects of LIPUS on granulosa cells (GCs) apoptosis and protein expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and BCL2-Associated X (Bax) in 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-induced POF mice and investigate the mechanisms of LIPUS on ovarian function and reserve capacity. The current POF mice model was administrated with VCD (160 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection for 15 consecutive days. The mice were divided into the POF group, LIPUS group and control group. In the LIPUS group, the right ovary of mice was treated by LIPUS (acoustic intensity was 200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, frequency was 0.3 MHz, and duty cycle was 20%) for 20 min, 15 consecutive days from day 16. The mice of the POF group and control group were treated without ultrasonic output. The basic observation and body weight were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&amp;E staining) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to detect ovarian follicle development, ovarian morphology and sex hormone secretion. Ovarian GCs apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that VCD can induce estrus cycle disorder, follicular atresia, sex hormone secretion decreased and GCs apoptosis in mice to establish POF model successfully. LIPUS significantly promoted follicular development, increased sex hormone secretion, inhibited excessive follicular atresia and GCs apoptosis. The mechanism might be achieved by increasing the protein expression of Bcl-2 and decreasing the expression of Bax in ovaries. LIPUS can improve the POF induced by VCD. These findings have the potential to provide novel methodological foundation for the future research, which help treat POF patients in the clinic.	2021	12	31	Reprod Biol Endocrinol	Xu	Haopeng
34295778	10.21037/tp-21-39	Effect of SOCS3 on apoptosis of human trophoblasts via adjustment of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in preterm birth.	The expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) was induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in preterm placental tissues. However, its role in IL-6 induced apoptosis of trophoblast cells derived from preterm placental tissues remains to be elucidated. Primary cytotrophoblasts from human preterm placental tissues were used to stably knock down and overexpress the level of SOCS3 by corresponding lentiviral vectors and the expression of SOCS3 was validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The effect of SOCS3 overexpression or knockdown on the proliferation and apoptosis of IL-6 treated human cytotrophoblasts were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay and Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide (PI) double-staining assay, respectively. Based on it, we detected the proteins associated with the Janus Tyrosine Kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway and apoptosis, such as JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and BCL2-associated X (Bax) by Western blot. IL-6-treatment resulted in significant apoptosis of human cytotrophoblasts. Overexpressing SOCS3 in the cytotrophoblasts reduced cell apoptosis, while the knockdown of SCOS3 had the opposite effects. Further analyses showed that SOCS3 overexpression inhibited JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation, which was induced by IL-6 stimulation. SOCS3 plays a protective role in human preterm placental tissue-derived cytotrophoblasts from IL-6 induced apoptosis by feedback inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling.	2022	04	25	Transl Pediatr	Yin	Yin
34295921	10.3389/fmolb.2021.681849	Novel Nanoliposomes Alleviate Contrast-Induced Nephropathy by Mediating Apoptosis Response in New Zealand Rabbits.	The aim of this study was to test the preventive effects of nano liposomes against contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in New Zealand rabbits. Sixty New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into four groups, with 15 rabbits in each group: control group, contrast group, hydration group and nano liposome group. Serum creatinine (Scr) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) were measured before and after injection of the contrast agent iopromide. Oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and apoptosis markers, such as Bcl2-Associated X (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rabbits were killed 24 h after injection of the contrast medium and both kidneys were removed. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assays were performed in kidney tissue. Pathological changes were analyzed under the optical and electron microscope. Compared with the hydration group, the nano liposome group showed improved protection of renal function, with significantly different Scr and BUN levels, incidence of CIN, apoptosis index, RT-PCR and Western blot protein expression patterns. Under the optical and electron microscope, the renal injury in the nano liposome group was less than in the hydration group. However, based on SOD and MDA, there was no significant difference in oxidative stress when compared with the hydration group. Apoptosis is an important mechanism in CIN. Nano liposomes can prevent the occurrence of CIN by decreasing apoptosis, reducing damage to the kidney by the contrast agent.	2021	07	24	Front Mol Biosci	Zhang	Peng
34302428	10.1111/jcmm.16793	Novel polysaccharide extracted from Sipunculus nudus inhibits HepG2 tumour growth in vivo by enhancing immune function and inducing tumour cell apoptosis.	A novel polysaccharide was extracted from Sipunculus nudus (SNP). The molecular weight (MW) of SNP was determined to be 9223 Da by high-performance gel permeation chromatography analyses, and the structure of the SNP repeat units was determined to be →3,4-β-D-GlcpNAC (1→ and →4) -α-D-Glcp (1→ in the ratio of 15:1; →2) -α -D-Galp - (1→ as a side chain; and β-D-Galp-(1→ and α- D-Glcp - (1→ as end groups by GC-MS analysis and NMR assays. The effect of SNP on hepatoma HepG2-bearing mice was analysed to verify its potential in the clinical treatment of liver cancer. A total of 90 male athymic nu/nu mice were divided into therapeutic and preventive groups and fed with different amounts of SNP. The antitumour effect of SNP on HepG2-bearing mice and mechanism of such were studied by analysing the tumour size, spleen index, thymus index, immune factors in the blood, tumour apoptosis factors, etc. The results suggest that SNP not only increased the index of immune organs in the body, but also enhanced the secretion of immune factors, including interleukin-2, interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in the serum. SNP induced the apoptosis of tumour cells via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which upregulated caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and BCL2-associated X, but downregulated B-cell lymphoma-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression. In conclusion, SNP inhibited tumour growth by enhancing immune function and inducing tumour cell apoptosis in HepG2-bearing mice. Therefore, SNP may be further investigated as a promising candidate for future antitumour drugs.	2022	02	14	J Cell Mol Med	Su	Jie
34302634	10.1007/s13258-021-01142-8	Lactucin induces apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-mediated BCL-2 and CFLAR<sub>L</sub> downregulation in Caki-1 cells.	Lactucin, a naturally occurring active sesquiterpene lactone, is abundantly found in chicory and romaine lettuce. A recent study reported that lactucin could induce apoptosis in leukemia cells. However, its cytotoxicity and potential molecular mechanisms underlying cancer cell death remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the direct effect and underlying mechanism of action of lactucin on renal cancer cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the rate of cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and protein stability analyses were performed to analyze the effect of lactucin on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and CFLAR (CASP8 and FADD like apoptosis regulator) long isoform (CFLAR<sub>L</sub>) in Caki-1 human renal cancer cells. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was evaluated using flow cytometry. Lactucin treatment induced apoptosis in Caki-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner via activation of the caspase pathway. It downregulated BCL-2 and CFLAR<sub>L</sub> expression levels by suppressing BCL-2 transcription and CFLAR<sub>L</sub> protein stability, respectively. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-1-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, attenuated the lactucin-induced apoptosis and restored the BCL-2 and CFLAR<sub>L</sub> expression to basal levels. Lactucin-facilitated BCL-2 downregulation was regulated at the transcriptional level through the inactivation of the NF-κB pathway. Our study is the first to demonstrate that lactucin-induced apoptosis is mediated by ROS production, which in turn activates the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway by inhibiting BCL-2 and CFLAR<sub>L</sub> expression in Caki-1 cells.	2022	03	07	Genes Genomics	Jang	Ji Hoon
34307232	10.4322/acr.2021.278	De novo double-hit B-cell precursor leukemia/lymphoma - an unusual presentation as peritoneal lymphomatosis.	Peritoneal lymphomatosis (PL) is a rare presentation of extranodal precursor leukemia/lymphoma. The presentation is often non-specific, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this case, though the preliminary diagnosis was established on ascitic fluid cytology, the disease progressed rapidly, leading to demise before initiating chemotherapy. Immunophenotyping and molecular studies, performed later, established a diagnosis of de novo B-cell precursor leukemia/lymphoma with <i>MYC</i>, <i>BCL2</i> rearrangements (Double-hit lymphoma). <i>MYC</i>, <i>BCL2</i> rearrangements are rarely reported in precursor B-lymphoma/leukemia which carry dismal prognosis. In this report, we illustrate autopsy findings of PL in an elderly gentleman who presented with ascites for evaluation.	2021	07	27	Autops Case Rep	Thirunavukkarasu	Balamurugan
34313135	10.2217/fon-2021-0370	Prediction and characterization of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell-of-origin subtypes using targeted sequencing.	The aim of the present study was to determine cell of origin (COO) from a platform using a DNA-based method, COO DNA classifier (COODC). A targeted exome-sequencing platform that applies the mutational profile of a sample was used to classify COO subtype. Two major mutational signatures associated with COO were identified: Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) signature 23 enriched in activated B cell (ABC) and COSMIC signature 3, which suggested increased frequency in germinal center B cell (GCB). Differential mutation signatures linked oncogenesis to mutational processes during B-cell activation, confirming the putative origin of GCB and ABC subtypes. Integrating COO with comprehensive genomic profiling enabled identification of features associated with COO and demonstrated the feasibility of determining COO without RNA. Lay abstract To determine subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer with poor survival, we aimed to identify DLBCL subtypes using DNA mutation-based tools. A targeted gene-sequencing platform, which measures the number and types of DNA mutations in a sample, was used to categorize DLBCL subtypes. Two major patterns of mutations associated with subtypes were identified: Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) signature 23 and COSMIC signature 3. Differences in how the subtypes developed suggest a link between tumor developments and B cells being activated normally, confirming where the DLBCL subtypes came from. Combining this information with comprehensive genomic profiling, which determines all of the genes that a person has, allowed identification of features that are associated with DLBCL subtypes and showed that a DLBCL subtype can be determined without using RNA.	2022	02	03	Future Oncol	Trabucco	Sally E

34328190	10.3892/mmr.2021.12327	Heat shock protein 70 attenuates hypoxia‑induced apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from neonatal rats.	Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) apoptosis is the initial stage of adult pulmonary hypertension (PH), which involves high pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, the mechanism regulating PMVEC apoptosis and its involvement in the early stages of neonatal hypoxic PH (HPH) pathogenesis are currently unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) on hypoxia‑induced apoptosis in PMVECs. PMVECs isolated from neonatal Sprague‑Dawley rats were transfected with lentivirus with or without HSP70, or treated with the synthetic HSP70 inhibitor N‑formyl‑3,4‑methylenedioxy‑benzylidene-g-butyrolactam under hypoxic conditions (5% O<sub>2</sub>) for 24, 48 or 72 h. PMVEC apoptosis was evaluated by performing flow cytometry and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assays. The expression levels of HSP70, hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α (HIF‑1α) and apoptosis‑associated proteins were determined by conducting reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. Following 24, 48 or 72 h of hypoxia, the apoptotic rates of PMVECs were significantly elevated compared with cells under normoxic conditions. The MMP was significantly reduced, whereas the mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF‑1α, cytochrome <i>c</i> (cyt C), caspase‑3 and HSP70 were enhanced by hypoxia compared with those under normoxic conditions. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) were significantly downregulated in the hypoxia group compared with those in the normoxia group. In hypoxic PMVECs, HSP70 overexpression decreased the apoptotic rate and the expression levels of cyt C, downregulated the expression levels of caspase‑3 and HIF‑1α, and increased the MMP and the expression levels of Bcl‑2. HSP70 inhibition resulted in the opposite outcomes compared with those of HSP70 overexpression. Therefore, the results of the present study suggested that HSP70 may inhibit mitochondrial pathway‑mediated apoptosis in isolated neonatal rat PMVECs in early‑stage hypoxia, which may be associated with HSP70‑mediated HIF‑1α downregulation. Overall, HSP70 may be protective against neonatal HPH through the HSP70/HIF‑1α pathway.	2021	09	03	Mol Med Rep	Cao	Jing
34334687	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001726	High-grade Follicular Lymphomas Exhibit Clinicopathologic, Cytogenetic, and Molecular Diversity Extending Beyond Grades 3A and 3B.	Although follicular lymphoma (FL) is usually graded as FL1-2, FL3A, and FL3B, some borderline cases can be observed and led us to investigate the clinicopathologic diversity of grade 3 FL (FL3). Among 2449 FL patients enrolled in Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) trials, 1921 cases with sufficient material underwent a central pathologic review. The resulting diagnoses comprised 89.6% FL1-2 (n=1723), 7.2% FL3A (n=138), and 0.5% purely follicular FL3B (n=9). The remaining 51 unclassifiable cases (2.7%) exhibited high-grade features but did not meet WHO criteria for either FL3A or FL3B; and were considered as ""unconventional"" high-grade FL (FL3U). FL3U morphological pattern consisted of nodular proliferation of large cleaved cells or small-sized to medium-sized blast cells. Compared with FL3A, FL3U exhibited higher MUM1 and Ki67 expression, less BCL2 breaks and more BCL6 rearrangements, together with a higher number of cases without any BCL2, BCL6 or MYC rearrangement. FL3U harbored less frequent mutations in BCL2, KMT2D, KMT2B, and CREBBP than FL3A. MYC and BCL2 were less frequently mutated in FL3U than FL3B. Rituximab cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone treated FL3U patients had a worse survival than FL1-2 patients with similar follicular lymphoma international prognostic index and treatment. These results suggest that high-grade FLs encompass a heterogeneous spectrum of tumors with variable morphology and genomic alterations, including FL3U cases that do not strictly fit WHO criteria for either FL3A or FL3B, and display a worse outcome than FL1-2. The distinction of FL3U may be useful to allow a better comprehension of high-grade FLs and to design clinical trials.	2021	10	04	Am J Surg Pathol	Laurent	Camille
34339901	10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106838	MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 expression as prognostic indicators in primary central nervous system lymphoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	We conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the predictive role of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 genetic alterations and protein expression in PCNSL for clinical application. A systematic retrieval was performed on PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, Web of Science, Scopus, and 2 Chinese databases. Cohort studies discussing the prognostic impact of MYC, BCl2, or BCL6 genetic alterations or gene expression in PCNSL were selected. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and median survival ratio (MSR) were calculated. 31 studies involving 1739 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. MYC expression was significantly associated with short median OS (MSR = 0.62; 95%CI, 0.44-0.88) and PFS (HR = 1.53; 95%CI, 1.06-2.20). No significant association was found between BCL2 expression and OS or PFS (P &gt; 0.05). BCL6 protein positivity was significantly associated with extended median OS (MSR = 1.62; 95%CI, 1.10-2.40). MYC and BCL2 coexpression was significantly associated with short median OS (MSR = 0.61; 95%CI, 0.45-0.84). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that MYC protein positivity remained as a significant indicator for short median OS in studies whose sample size ≥ 45, treatment without WBRT, quality scale score ≥ 7, and positivity threshold set at 40% stratum (MSR &lt; 1 and P &lt; 0.05), but failed to reach a statistically significant difference in the other stratum. MYC expression predicts inferior median OS and PFS in PCNSL. BCL6 protein positivity is associated with a favorable prognosis. The sample size, average age of subjects, WBRT treatment, study quality, and cut-off values for discriminating positive and negative protein expression in IHC may be origins of heterogeneity.	2022	01	27	Clin Neurol Neurosurg	Ge	Le
34343635	10.1016/j.canlet.2021.07.045	Evasion of cell death: A contributory factor in prostate cancer development and treatment resistance.	Cell death is a natural process in organismal development, homeostasis and response to disease or infection that eliminates unnecessary or potentially dangerous cells and acts as an innate barrier to oncogenesis. Inactivation of cell death is a key step in tumour development and also impedes effective response to cancer therapy. Precise execution of unwanted cells is achieved through regulated cell death processes including the intrinsic apoptotic pathway that is governed by the BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family. There is compelling evidence that intrinsic apoptosis is defective in prostate cancer, particularly in metastatic and castration resistant advanced disease, currently a lethal diagnosis. New therapeutics have been developed to target pro-survival BCL-2 proteins (including BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1) and show promise in reinstating apoptosis to destroy tumour cells in haematological cancers. Here we discuss perturbation of cell death in prostate cancer and how new therapeutics could improve treatment outcome in prostate cancer.	2022	01	07	Cancer Lett	Campbell	Kirsteen J
34346845	10.1080/21655979.2021.1950282	Long non-coding RNA MCM3AP antisense RNA 1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer progression through targeting microRNA-195-5p.	Lung cancer (LC) ranks first among all causes of cancer-related death, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) taking up 85% of lung cancer cases. Although lncRNA MCM3AP antisense RNA 1 (MCM3AP-AS1) has been reported to be an oncogenic factor in NSCLC, its detailed mechanism in NSCLC is unknown. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine MCM3AP-AS1, microRNA (miR)-195-5p and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) mRNA expressions in NSCLC tissues and cells. Western blot was utilized to determine the expression levels of E2F3, BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), E-cadherin and N-cadherin. CCK-8 and Transwell assays were conducted to examine cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments were used to determine the regulatory relationships between MCM3AP-AS1 and miR-195-5p, and miR-195-5p and E2F3. We demonstrated that MCM3AP-AS1 was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues and cells, and MCM3AP-AS1 overexpression accelerated the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. In addition, MCM3AP-AS1 overexpression markedly up-modulated Bcl-2 expression and repressed Bax expression; MCM3AP-AS1 overexpression also significantly up-regulated N-cadherin expression and suppressed E-cadherin expression in NSCLC cells. What is more, in NSCLC cells, miR-195-5p was a target of MCM3AP-AS1, and the latter worked as a molecular sponge for miR-195-5p to regulate E2F3 expression. Collectively, MCM3AP-AS1, serving as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate miR-195-5p/E2F3 axis, promotes NSCLC progression, which is a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.	2021	12	17	Bioengineered	Shen	Dijian
34353509	10.1016/j.eimce.2020.06.017	Circulating Bcl-2 concentrations and septic patient mortality.	There are not data on blood B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) concentrations (one of the antiapoptotic molecules of the Bcl-2 family in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway) in septic patients. Therefore, this study was carried with the aims to explore whether blood Bcl-2 concentrations at diagnosis of sepsis are different in survivor and non-survivor septic patients, are associated with mortality, and are useful for the mortality prediction. Intensive Care Units from 3 Spanish hospitals participated in this observational and prospective study with septic patients and serum Bcl-2 concentrations at diagnosis of sepsis were determined. Mortality at 30 days was as outcome variable. We found that 30-day non-surviving patients (n=81) showed lower serum Bcl-2 levels (p=0.003) than surviving patients (n=140). We found that serum concentrations of Bcl-2&lt;4.4ng/mL were associated with mortality (OR=3.228; 95% CI=1.406-7.415; p=0.006) in the multiple logistic regression analysis, and that showed an area under the curve for mortality prediction of 62% (95% CI=55-68%; p=0.003). In our study appears novel findings such as higher blood Bcl-2 concentrations in survivor than in non-survivor septic patients, the association between low blood Bcl-2 concentrations and mortality of septic patients, and the ability of blood Bcl-2 concentrations for the prediction of septic patient mortality.	2021	10	22	Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed)	Lorente	Leonardo
34359500	10.3390/foods10071630	Transcriptional Changes after Enniatins A, A1, B and B1 Ingestion in Rat Stomach, Liver, Kidney and Lower Intestine.	Enniatins (ENs) are depsipeptide mycotoxins produced by <i>Fusarium</i> fungi. They are known for their capacity to modulate cell membrane permeability and disruption of ionic gradients, affecting cell homeostasis and initiating oxidative stress mechanisms. The effect of the acute toxicity of ENs A, A1, B and B1 at two different concentrations after 8 h of exposure was analysed in Wistar rats by a transcriptional approach. The following key mitochondrial and nuclear codified genes related to the electron transport chain were considered for gene expression analysis in stomach, liver, kidney and lower intestine by quantitative Real-Time PCR: mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 (MT-ND1), mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MT-COX1), succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit A and ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, respectively. Moreover, the expression of markers involved in oxidative stresssuperoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), heme oxygenase 1, apoptosis B-cell lymphoma 2, Bcl2 Associated protein X (Bax), tumor suppressor protein (p53), inhibition of apoptosis nuclear factor kappa of activated B cells, immune system interleukin 1β and intestinal tight junction Occludin merely in lower intestine tissues have been investigated. For mitochondrial genes, the main differences were observed for MT-ND1 and MT-COX1, showing its deficiency in all selected organs. With regard to the intestinal barrier's cellular response to oxidative stress, the activity of the antioxidant gene SOD1 was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the catalytic enzyme GPx1 was also downregulated though merely at medium dose employed. On the contrary, the pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 regulators were activated after ENs exposure, reporting a significant increase in their expression. Furthermore, the alteration of intestinal permeability was assessed by the abnormal activity of the tight junction protein occludin. In summary, ENs may generate mitochondrial disorders and induce oxidative stress in intestinal barrier function.	2021	08	09	Foods	Cimbalo	Alessandra
34369229	10.1080/10428194.2021.1957873	Thiostrepton inhibits growth and induces apoptosis by targeting FoxM1/SKP2/MTH1 axis in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.	Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, however, its role has not been elucidated in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-pre-ALL). In the current study, we showed that the downregulation of FoxM1 by its inhibitor thiostrepton inhibited cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in a panel of B-pre-ALL cell lines. Thiostrepton led downregulation of FoxM1 accompanied by decreased expression of Aurora kinase A, B, matrix metalloproteinases, and oncogene SKP2 as well as MTH1. Downregulation of the FoxM1/SKP2/MTH1 axis led to increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and suppression of antiapoptotic proteins. Thiostrepton-mediated apoptosis was prevented by N-acetyl cysteine, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Co-treatment of B-pre-ALL with subtoxic doses of thiostrepton and bortezomib potentiated the proapoptotic action. Altogether, our results suggest that targeting FoxM1expression could be an attractive strategy for the treatment of B-pre-ALL.	2022	04	14	Leuk Lymphoma	Kuttikrishnan	Shilpa
34378195	10.1111/bjh.17765	Genetic subtype classification using a simplified algorithm and mutational characteristics of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a Japanese cohort.	Recent large-scale genetic studies have proposed a new genetic classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is clinically and biologically heterogeneous. However, the classification methods were complicated to be introduced into clinical practice. Here we retrospectively evaluated the mutational status and copy number changes of 144 genes in 177 Japanese patients with DLBCL, using targeted DNA sequencing. We developed a simplified algorithm for classifying four genetic subtypes-MYD88, NOTCH2, BCL2, and SGK1-by assessing alterations in 18 representative genes and BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangement status, integrating the significant genes from previous studies. In our cohort and another validation cohort from published data, the classification results in our algorithm showed close agreement with the other established algorithm. A differential prognosis among the four groups was observed. The NOTCH2 group showed a particularly poorer outcome than similar groups in previous reports. Furthermore, our study revealed unreported genetic features in the DLBCL subtypes that are mainly reported in Japanese patients, such as CD5-positive DLBCL and methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. These results indicate the utility of our simplified method for DLBCL genetic subtype classification, which can facilitate the optimisation of treatment strategies. In addition, our study highlights the genetic features of Japanese patients with DLBCL.	2022	01	03	Br J Haematol	Mishina	Tatsuzo

We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) to analyze and compare <i>MYC</i>r in different B-cell neoplasms. The <i>MYC</i>r features of cases with plasma cell myeloma (PCM) (<i>n</i> = 88) showed distinct characteristics compared to cases with mature B-cell lymphomas (<i>n</i> = 62, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high grade lymphoma with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements (HGBL)): they were more complex and showed a wider variety of translocation partners and breakpoints. Additionally, unlike B-cell lymphomas, they showed no evidence of activation-induced deaminase (AID) involvement in the formation of <i>MYC</i>r with immunoglobolin heavy chain (IGH), indicating a different mechanism of origin. The different <i>MYC</i>r characteristics resulted in poor <i>MYC</i>r detection rates by fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization of only 50% in PCM, compared to 94% in lymphoma.	2022	04	14	Leuk Lymphoma	Bendig	Sonja
34382859	10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0059	Ginkgolic Acid Suppresses Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Growth by Inducing Apoptosis and Inhibiting <i>AKT/NF-κB</i> Signaling.	Even though nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is not common worldwide, it is a major public health burden in endemic areas. Distant metastasis often leads to a poor prognosis for NPC; therefore, new and effective anticancer strategies are needed. Ginkgolic acid (GA) is small-molecule compound existing in <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> that has various biologically relevant activities, including antitumor properties; however, its effects and mechanism of action in NPC are unknown. The effects of GA on NPC and such underlying mechanisms were investigated using 5-8F and CNE2 cells and NP69 human immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells in this study. Moreover, the xenograft models were built to examine GA's effection <i>in vivo</i>. GA treatment decreased the survival and invasive capacity of 5-8F and CNE2 and induced their apoptosis, which varied with dose; this was accompanied by downregulation of B cell lymphoma (Bcl)2, upregulation of Bcl2-associated X protein, and activation of poly-ADP ribose polymerase, and caspase-9/-3. G0/G1 phase arrest was induced by GA in NPCs. It also reduced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 and its regulators cyclin D2 and cyclin D3. GA inhibited the activation of protein kinase B/nuclear factor signaling; this effect was potentiated with GA and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which also enhanced 5-FU-induced apoptosis. In summary, GA may be effective as an adjuvant to conventional chemotherapy drugs in preventing the progression of NPC.	2021	08	20	J Med Food	Xiao	Yu

The co-expression of BCL6(-) and BCL2(S+) has significant influence on prognosis of DLBCL (<i>P</i>=0.005 and <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) , in which BCL6(+)/non-BCL2(S+) (<i>n</i>=86) has the best prognosis[3-year-OS (71.6±4.9) %, 3-year-PFS (67.0±5.1) %], and BCL6(-)/BCL2(S+) (<i>n</i>=10) has the worst prognosis[3-year-OS (20.0±12.6) %, 3-year-PFS (10.0±9.5) %]; the co-expression of BCL6(-) and P53(+) has no significant influence on prognosis (<i>P</i>=0.061 and <i>P</i>=0.089) , however, those cases with BCL6(+)/P53(-) (<i>n</i>=98) often get better prognosis[3-year-OS (70.6±4.7) %, 3-year-PFS (64.6±4.9) %] than others; the co-expression of P53(+) and BCL2(S+) has significant influence on prognosis of DLBCL (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001 and <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) , and P53(+)/BCL2(S+) (<i>n</i>=5) has the worst prognosis (3-year-OS and 3-year-PFS are both 0) ; BCL2(S+) cases get shorter OS and PFS, regardless of the expression of BCL6 and P53. <b>Conclusion:</b> The expression and co-expression of BCL6 negative, P53 positive and BCL2(S+) have certain value in the prognostic evaluation of DLBCL, especially in the group of age≤60-year-old and IPI score 0-2. <b>目的：</b> 筛选并分析与弥漫大B细胞淋巴瘤（DLBCL）预后相关的免疫表型，探究其预后价值。 <b>方法：</b> 选取天津医科大学肿瘤医院2011年1月至2016年12月收治的163例DLBCL患者，免疫组织化学染色检测DLBCL常见免疫表型，COX模型探索独立于国际预后指数（IPI）影响总生存（OS）与无进展生存（PFS）的免疫表型，并分析其两两联合表达对预后的影响。 <b>结果：</b> 多因素分析显示BCL6阴性（PFS：<i>HR</i>=1.652，95%<i>CI</i> 1.030~2.649，<i>P</i>=0.037）、P53阳性（OS：<i>HR</i>=1.842，95%<i>CI</i> 1.008~3.367，<i>P</i>=0.047）、BCL2强阳性（OS：<i>HR</i>=2.102，95%<i>CI</i> 1.249~3.537，<i>P</i>=0.005；PFS：<i>HR</i>=2.126，95%<i>CI</i> 1.312~3.443，<i>P</i>=0.002）是DLBCL中独立于IPI的预后不良因素。亚组分析显示，在年龄≤60岁组患者中BCL6阴性（PFS：<i>HR</i>=2.042，95%<i>CI</i> 1.021~4.081，<i>P</i>=0.043）、P53阳性（OS：<i>HR</i>=3.069，95%<i>CI</i> 1.244~7.569，<i>P</i>=0.015）和BCL2强阳性（OS：<i>HR</i>=2.433，95%<i>CI</i> 1.165~5.082，<i>P</i>=0.018；PFS：<i>HR</i>=3.209，95%<i>CI</i> 1.606~6.410，<i>P</i>=0.001）对预后影响显著；在IPI 0~2分亚组患者中，BCL6阴性（OS：<i>HR</i>=2.467，95%<i>CI</i> 1.322~4.604，<i>P</i>=0.005；PFS：<i>HR</i>=2.248，95%<i>CI</i> 1.275~3.965，<i>P</i>=0.005）和BCL2强阳性（PFS：<i>HR</i>=2.045，95%<i>CI</i> 1.119~3.735，<i>P</i>=0.020）对预后影响显著。BCL6和BCL2强阳性的联合表达与DLBCL的预后相关（<i>P</i>=0.005和<i>P</i>&lt;0.001），BCL6阳性/BCL2非强阳性（86例）预后最好[3年OS率（71.6±4.9）%，3年PFS率（67.0±5.1）%]，BCL6阴性/BCL2强阳性（10例）预后最差[3年OS率（20.0±12.6）%，3年PFS率（10.0±9.5）%]；BCL6、P53的联合表达与DLBCL的预后差异无统计学意义（<i>P</i>=0.061和<i>P</i>=0.089），但生存曲线显示BCL6阳性/P53阴性的病例（98例）预后较好[3年OS率（70.6±4.7）%，3年PFS率（64.6±4.9）%]；BCL2强阳性、P53的联合表达与DLBCL的预后显著相关（<i>P</i>&lt;0.001和<i>P</i>&lt;0.001），BCL2强阳性/P53阳性的病例（5例）预后最差（3年OS率和PFS率均为0）；无论BCL6与P53表达如何，BCL2强阳性的病例预后均比非强阳性病例差。 <b>结论：</b> BCL6阴性、P53阳性、BCL2强阳性三种免疫表型单独及联合表达对DLBCL尤其是年龄≤60岁和IPI 0~2分患者的预后预测具有一定价值。.	2021	08	16	Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Yang	X
34386317	10.1016/j.apsb.2020.10.018	Natural compounds modulate the autophagy with potential implication of stroke.	Stroke is considered a leading cause of mortality and neurological disability, which puts a huge burden on individuals and the community. To date, effective therapy for stroke has been limited by its complex pathological mechanisms. Autophagy refers to an intracellular degrading process with the involvement of lysosomes. Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis and survival of cells by eliminating damaged or non-essential cellular constituents. Increasing evidence support that autophagy protects neuronal cells from ischemic injury. However, under certain circumstances, autophagy activation induces cell death and aggravates ischemic brain injury. Diverse naturally derived compounds have been found to modulate autophagy and exert neuroprotection against stroke. In the present work, we have reviewed recent advances in naturally derived compounds that regulate autophagy and discussed their potential application in stroke treatment.	2021	08	14	Acta Pharm Sin B	Ahsan	Anil
34388250	10.1093/jnen/nlab080	Expression of STAT6 and Phosphorylated STAT6 in Primary Central Nervous System Lymphomas.	The signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) is implicated in the pathogenesis of some lymphomas including primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs). The aim of this study was to investigate STAT6 expression and clinicopathologic features in 25 PCNSLs using immunohistochemistry with 2 different anti-STAT6 antibodies. One (YE361) recognizes the C-terminus domain of the STAT6 protein and the other (Y641) recognizes the phosphorylated form of the protein. The phosphorylated STAT6 form was not expressed in any of the cases studied whereas the YE361 STAT6 showed only cytoplasmic expression in 14 (56%) cases. This expression did not correlate with age, prognostic score, multiplicity, invasion of deep structures, response to treatment, disease recurrence, overall survival, or BCL6, BCL2, PD-L1, and CD8 expression. A STAT6 expression score showed a trend for correlating with clinical performance status. It also showed a positive correlation with MYC expression. Thus, the phosphorylated form of STAT6 was not found in the current series, while the YE361 STAT6 showed only cytoplasmic expression and was associated with expression of MYC.	2021	12	29	J Neuropathol Exp Neurol	Karpathiou	Georgia
34389272	10.1016/j.clml.2021.07.012	SOHO State of the Art Updates and Next Questions: The Past, Present and Future of Venetoclax-Based Therapies in AML.	The use of venetoclax in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMA) has changed the paradigm for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in elderly patients and those unfit for intensive chemotherapy. A phase 3 study has shown superior response rates and improved overall survival for patients treated with venetoclax + azacitidine compared with the previous standard of care, azacitidine alone. This success has led to multiple exciting follow-up studies, including investigations related to the discovery of predictors of response, relapse, and the mechanism of action of this therapy. While venetoclax + HMA has shown significant benefit in elderly patients unfit for chemotherapy, further questions remain as to how this therapy can be expanded into other populations including relapsed or refractory patients and younger newly diagnosed patients with adverse risk features. In this article, we discuss the clinical outcomes of AML with venetoclax + HMA, established and potential predictors of response to this regimen, its mechanisms of action, and speculate on the future of venetoclax + HMA therapy in AML.	2022	04	07	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Inguva	Anagha
34400859	10.1016/j.jsps.2021.04.027	Effects of neoadjuvant therapies on genetic regulation of targeted pathways in ER+ primary ductal breast carcinoma: A meta-analysis of microarray datasets.	Breast cancer arises as a result of multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Conventionally, breast cancer is treated based on histopathological and clinical features. DNA technologies like the human genome microarray are now partially integrated into clinical practice and are used for developing new ""personalized medicines"" and ""pharmacogenetics"" for improving the efficiency and safety of cancer medications. We investigated the effects of four established therapies-for ER+ ductal breast cancer-on the differential gene expression. The therapies included single agent tamoxifen, two-agent docetaxel and capecitabine, or combined three-agents CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Genevestigator 8.1.0 was used to compare five datasets from patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, untreated or treated with selected drugs, to those from the healthy control. We identified 74 differentially expressed genes involved in three pathways, i.e., apoptosis (extrinsic and intrinsic), oxidative signaling, and PI3K/Akt signaling. The treatments affected the expression of apoptotic genes (<i>TNFRSF10B</i> [<i>TRAIL</i>], <i>FAS</i>, <i>CASP3/6/7/8</i>, <i>PMAIP1</i> [<i>NOXA</i>], <i>BNIP3L</i>, <i>BNIP3</i>, <i>BCL2A1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i>), the oxidative stress-related genes (<i>NOX4</i>, <i>XDH</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>GSR</i>, <i>GPX3</i>, and <i>SOD3</i>), and the PI3K/Akt pathway gene (<i>ERBB2</i> [<i>HER2</i>]). Breast cancer treatments are complex with varying drug responses and efficacy among patients. This necessitates identifying novel biomarkers for predicting the drug response, using available data and new technologies. <i>GSR</i>, <i>NOX4</i>, <i>CASP3</i>, and <i>ERBB2</i> are potential biomarkers for predicting the treatment response in primary ER+ ductal breast carcinoma.	2021	08	18	Saudi Pharm J	Albogami	Sarah M
34400968	10.22037/ijpr.2019.14907.12738	Evaluation of Nrf2, Keap1 and Apoptotic Pathway Genes Expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression Nrf2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-p45 derived factor 2) and Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) genes and Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), Bcl-XL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large), Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) apoptotic pathway genes in acute myeloid leukemia patients. In this case-control study, the expression of genes encoding Nrf2, Keap1, Bcl2, Bcl- XL and Bax in 40 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were compared with 40 normal individuals in the Iranian population. We evaluated the mRNA expression of genes by using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of Nrf2, Bcl2 and Bcl- XL genes in new AML patients were increased (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.05). The patients treated with chemotherapy had a significantly more than four times higher expression level of Nrf2 than new case patients (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.05), while there was a decrease in the expression level of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL, which was not statistically significant. In other hands in relapsed patients, the expressions of Nrf2, Bcl2 and Bcl- XL were higher level than new case patients (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) but this was less than patients treated with chemotherapy (<i>p &gt;</i> 0.05). The high levels of mentioned genes may be associated with poor treatment response, chemoresistance and disease recurrence. Because of hyperactivation and overexpression of Nrf2 in leukemia, suggest that Nrf2 inhibitors could be used as a pharmacological target in combination with classical chemotherapeutic agents to increase the efficacy of anticancer therapy.	2021	08	18	Iran J Pharm Res	Jalali	Amir
34402163	10.1111/jcmm.16822	BAG1 down-regulation increases chemo-sensitivity of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells.	BCL2-associated athanogene-1 (BAG1) is a multi-functional protein that is found deregulated in several solid cancers and in paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia. The investigation of BAG1 isoforms expression and intracellular localization in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) patient-derived specimens revealed that BAG1 levels decrease during disease remission, compared to diagnosis, but drastically increase at relapse. In particular, at diagnosis both BAG1-L and BAG1-M isoforms are mainly nuclear, while during remission the localization pattern changes, having BAG1-M almost exclusively in the cytosol indicating its potential cytoprotective role in B-ALL. In addition, knockdown of BAG1/BAG3 induces cell apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest and, more intriguingly, shapes cell response to chemotherapy. BAG1-depleted cells show an increased sensitivity to the common chemotherapeutic agents, dexamethasone or daunorubicin, and to the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-737. Moreover, the BAG1 inhibitor Thio-2 induces a cytotoxic effect on RS4;11 cells both in vitro and in a zebrafish xenograft model and strongly synergizes with pan-BCL inhibitors. Collectively, these data sustain BAG1 deregulation as a critical event in assuring survival advantage to B-ALL cells.	2022	02	21	J Cell Mol Med	Mariotto	Elena
34404436	10.1186/s13027-021-00396-x	Clinicopathological and prognostic features of hepatitis B virus-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a single-center retrospective study in China.	While the epidemiologic association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is established, little is known about the pathological characteristics and outcome of DLBCL arising in patients with HBV infection. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 420 patients with DLBCL for the incidence of HBV infection, and the clinicopathologic features and prognostic factors in HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients in China, a hepatitis B endemic area. In our study, 127 (30.2%) patients were HBsAg-positive. HBsAg-positive DLBCL displayed a younger median onset age (50 vs. 54 years, P = 0.002), more frequent involvement of the spleen (19.7% vs. 6.1%, P &lt; 0.001), less frequent involvement of the small and large intestine (2.3% vs. 11.2%, P = 0.003), more advanced disease (stage III/IV: 56.7% vs. 45.1%, P = 0.028), and lower expression rate of MYC (49.1% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.026). The median follow-up time was 61.9 months. Univariate analysis showed that there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between HBsAg-negative and -positive DLBCL (P = 0.577). In the HBsAg-positive DLBCL subgroup, age older than 60 years, advanced disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), spleen involvement, B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), and double expressers of MYC and BCL2 had a significantly worse outcome, and patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) had a better prognosis. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that spleen involvement and rituximab use were independent prognostic factors in HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients. Our study indicates that HBsAg-positive DLBCL has unique clinicopathological features and independent prognostic factors. Moreover, under antiviral prophylaxis, the survival of DLBCL patients with HBV infections was comparable to that of HBV-negative patients, and the use of rituximab significantly improved OS in HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients.	2021	08	21	Infect Agent Cancer	Chen	Dao-Guang
34406351	10.1093/ajcp/aqab043	Light Chain-Restricted Plasmacytoid Cells in Hyperplastic Germinal CentersA Clinicopathologic Investigation.	Follicular hyperplasias (FHs) with light chain-restricted (LCR) plasmacytoid/plasma cells (PCs) within germinal centers (GCs) based on immunohistochemistry (IHC)/in situ hybridization (ISH) can potentially lead to diagnostic error. This study aims to better characterize such cases, including their clinical implications. LC expression by IHC/ISH was quantitatively assessed in GCs of 17 FHs with LCRGCs. BCL2, CD10, BCL6, BCL2, immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains, IgG4, and Epstein-Barr encoding region stains were performed. In total, 8 cases had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based clonality studies. All cases showed FH, including 4 with progressively transformed GCs (PTGCs); 0.8% to 52% (median, 21%) of the GCs were LCR; 13 of 17 had both κ- and λ-LCRGCs, and 4 of 17 had only κ-LCRGCs; 7 of 16 had prominent intrafollicular IgG4-positive cells. One case demonstrated BCL2-positive cells in focal LCRGCs but lacked BCL2 rearrangement. B-cell monoclonality was demonstrated in 3 of 8 cases (only after microdissection). Seven patients had autoimmune disorders, and 1 had had a transplant. Three patients had a history of lymphoma, 1 developed lymphoma, and 1 developed lymphomatoid granulomatosis subsequently. FHs with LCRGC by IHC/ISH are typically not associated with the development of lymphoma, even though they can express BCL2 and show monoclonality by PCR. They may be associated with increased intrafollicular IgG4-positive cells, PTGC, and autoimmunity.	2021	11	09	Am J Clin Pathol	Wang	Xuan J
34406846	10.1089/gtmb.2021.0009	<i>miR-1</i> Targeted Downregulation of <i>Bcl-2</i> Increases Chemosensitivity of Lung Cancer Cells.	<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To investigate the expression of B cell lymphoma-2 (<i>Bcl-2</i>) in lung cancer cells and the effect of the <i>miR-1</i>/<i>Bcl-2</i> axis on the chemosensitivity of lung cancer. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to detect the expression of <i>Bcl-2</i> in human embryonic lung fibroblasts and lung cancer cells. The effects of siRNA directed against <i>Bcl-2</i>, in lung cancer tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry; these results were used to develop prognostic models. Bioinformatic analyses, dual luciferase reporter gene technology, and western blotting technology were used to explore the targeted regulation of <i>miR-1</i> on bcl-2. The effect of <i>miR-1</i> on the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells was measured using the MTT assay. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Compared with human embryonic lung fibroblasts, <i>Bcl-2</i> was highly expressed in the lung cancer cells, especially in H460 cells. After silencing <i>Bcl-2</i> with siRNA, the sensitivity of the cells to cisplatin (CDDP) increased. Immunohistochemical results and prognostic analysis revealed that high <i>Bcl-2</i> expression in lung cancer tissues was negatively correlated with prognosis of lung cancer patients; A dual luciferase reporter assay combined with western blotting confirmed that <i>miR-1</i> can bind to the <i>Bcl-2</i>3' UTR region and regulate its expression. Overexpression of <i>miR-1</i> in lung cancer cells (H460 and A549) increased the sensitivity of these cells to CDDP. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> <i>Bcl-2</i> is upregulated in lung cancer cells, which is negatively correlated with the patient prognosis. <i>miR-1</i> affects the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells by targeting <i>Bcl-2</i>. These data should provide a theoretical basis for refining the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance in lung cancer.	2022	01	28	Genet Test Mol Biomarkers	Chen	Cuimei
34417162	10.1016/j.clml.2021.07.016	A Phase 2 Study of PNT2258 for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Malignancies.	PNT2258 consists of a native, chemically unmodified, 24-base DNA oligonucleotide designed to target the regulatory region upstream of the BCL2 gene, delivered in a protective liposome. Derangement of BCL2-regulated control mechanisms is a defining characteristic of certain malignancies, and it was hypothesized that the oligonucleotide would promote anticancer activity via suppression of BCL2 transcription. PNT2258 was evaluated in this, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label Phase 2 study in 13 participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies to investigate potential antitumor activity and safety. Participants with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia received intravenous PNT2258 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles, followed by 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1 to 2 of a 28-day cycle until study withdrawal. All 13 participants were treated with PNT2258 monotherapy and evaluable for response and safety and tolerability. The overall response rate was 53.8% (7/13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.1%-80.8%). Median duration of response was 23.4 months (range, 3, 31.5). The disease control rate of participants with stable disease or better was 84.6% (95% CI, 54.6%-98.1%). The most frequently (≥50%) observed adverse events (AEs) were nausea, chills, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, vomiting, and back pain. Hypertension (30.8%) and diarrhea (23.1%) were the most frequent grade ≥3 AEs. No deaths were observed. Clinically meaningful and durable activity with an acceptable safety profile was observed in participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies who received single-agent PNT2258.

34424320	10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003276	The ROR1 antibody-drug conjugate huXBR1-402-G5-PNU effectively targets ROR1+ leukemia.	Antibody-drug conjugates directed against tumor-specific targets have allowed targeted delivery of highly potent chemotherapy to malignant cells while sparing normal cells. Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is an oncofetal protein with limited expression on normal adult tissues and is overexpressed on the surface of malignant cells in mantle cell lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia with t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This differential expression makes ROR1 an attractive target for antibody-drug conjugate therapy, especially in malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia, in which systemic chemotherapy remains the gold standard. Several preclinical and phase 1 clinical studies have established the safety and effectiveness of anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Herein we describe a humanized, first-in-class anti-ROR1 antibody-drug conjugate, huXBR1-402-G5-PNU, which links a novel anti-ROR1 antibody (huXBR1-402) to a highly potent anthracycline derivative (PNU). We found that huXBR1-402-G5-PNU is cytotoxic to proliferating ROR1+ malignant cells in vitro and suppressed leukemia proliferation and extended survival in multiple models of mice engrafted with human ROR1+ leukemia. Lastly, we show that the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-dependent cytotoxicity of huXBR1-402-G5-PNU can be leveraged by combined treatment strategies with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Together, our data present compelling preclinical evidence for the efficacy of huXBR1-402-G5-PNU in treating ROR1+ hematologic malignancies.	2021	09	13	Blood Adv	Hu	Eileen Y
34424958	10.1182/blood.2021012052	Insertion of atypical glycans into the tumor antigen-binding site identifies DLBCLs with distinct origin and behavior.	Glycosylation of the surface immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region is a remarkable follicular lymphoma-associated feature rarely seen in normal B cells. Here, we define a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) that acquire N-glycosylation sites selectively in the Ig complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the antigen-binding sites. Mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography demonstrate how the inserted glycans are stalled at oligomannose-type structures because they are buried in the CDR loops. Acquisition of sites occurs in ∼50% of germinal-center B-cell-like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL), mainly of the genetic EZB subtype, irrespective of IGHV-D-J use. This markedly contrasts with the activated B-cell-like DLBCL Ig, which rarely has sites in the CDR and does not seem to acquire oligomannose-type structures. Acquisition of CDR-located acceptor sites associates with mutations of epigenetic regulators and BCL2 translocations, indicating an origin shared with follicular lymphoma. Within the EZB subtype, these sites are associated with more rapid disease progression and with significant gene set enrichment of the B-cell receptor, PI3K/AKT/MTORC1 pathway, glucose metabolism, and MYC signaling pathways, particularly in the fraction devoid of MYC translocations. The oligomannose-type glycans on the lymphoma cells interact with the candidate lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), mediating low-level signals, and lectin-expressing cells form clusters with lymphoma cells. Both clustering and signaling are inhibited by antibodies specifically targeting the DC-SIGN carbohydrate recognition domain. Oligomannosylation of the tumor Ig is a posttranslational modification that readily identifies a distinct GCB-DLBCL category with more aggressive clinical behavior, and it could be a potential precise therapeutic target via antibody-mediated inhibition of the tumor Ig interaction with DC-SIGN-expressing M2-polarized macrophages.	2021	12	10	Blood	Chiodin	Giorgia
34425193	10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121034	Transferrin-conjugated liposomes loaded with carnosic acid inhibit liver cancer growth by inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.	Our previous studies have proven that carnosic acid (CA) induces apoptosis of liver cancer cells. However, the poor chemical properties of CA limit its in vivo anti-cancer effects. In this study, CA was loaded into liposomes (LP-CA), and LP-CA was further conjugated with transferrin (Tf-LP-CA) to overcome the shortcomings of poor solubility and absorption at the lesion site. In HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, compared with CA and LP-CA, more Tf-LP-CA was absorbed by liver cancer cells, which induced higher levels of apoptosis and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential more effectively. In HepG2- and SMMC-7721-xenotransplanted mice, Tf-LP-CA inhibited tumor growth with no cytotoxicity to the liver, spleen, or kidney. Furthermore, compared with CA and LP-CA, Tf-LP-CA targeted the tumor site more effectively, enhanced the expressions of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and Caspase-3 and -9, and regulated the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family members in the tumor tissues. Tf-LP-CA was taken up by tumor cells and targeted at tumor tissues, ensuring the precise delivery of CA, which further promoted mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis in the liver cancer cells. These results provide evidence for the clinical application of the Tf-LP-based CA drug delivery system for liver cancer.	2021	09	22	Int J Pharm	Liu	Xin
34438040	10.1016/j.annonc.2021.08.1991	SPARC-positive macrophages are the superior prognostic factor in the microenvironment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and independent of MYC rearrangement and double-/triple-hit status.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to outcome. Features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are associated with prognosis when assessed by gene expression profiling. However, it is uncertain whether assessment of the microenvironment can add prognostic information to the most relevant and clinically well-established molecular subgroups when analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We carried out a histopathologic analysis of biomarkers related to TME in a very large cohort (n = 455) of DLBCL treated in prospective trials and correlated with clinicopathologic and molecular data, including chromosomal rearrangements and gene expression profiles for cell-of-origin and TME. The content of PD1+, FoxP3+ and CD8+, as well as vessel density, was not associated with outcome. However, we found a low content of CD68+ macrophages to be associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.023 and 0.040, respectively) at both univariable and multivariable analyses, adjusted for the factors of the International Prognostic Index (IPI), MYC break and BCL2/MYC and BCL6/MYC double-hit status. The subgroup of PDL1+ macrophages was not associated with survival. Instead, secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC)-positive macrophages were identified as the subtype of macrophages most associated with survival. SPARC-positive macrophages and stromal cells directly correlated with favorable PFS and OS (both, P[log rank] &lt;0.001, P[trend] &lt; 0.001). The association of SPARC with prognosis was independent of the factors of the IPI, MYC double-/triple-hit status, Bcl2/c-myc double expression, cell-of-origin subtype and a recently published gene expression signature [lymphoma-associated macrophage interaction signature (LAMIS)]. SPARC expression in the TME detected by a single IHC staining with fair-to-good interobserver reproducibility is a powerful prognostic parameter. Thus SPARC expression is a strong candidate for risk assessment in DLBCL in daily practice.	2021	10	28	Ann Oncol	Croci	G A
34438219	10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2021.111580	DNA binding and evaluation of anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo of iridium(III) polypyridyl complexes.	In this report, we synthesized three new iridium(III) complexes: [Ir(piq)<sub>2</sub>(apip)]PF<sub>6</sub> (Ir1, piq = 1-phenylisoquinoline, apip = 2-aminophenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline), [Ir(piq)<sub>2</sub>(maip)]PF<sub>6</sub> (Ir2, maip = 3-aminophenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline) and [Ir(piq)<sub>2</sub>(paip)]PF<sub>6</sub> (Ir3, paip = 4-aminophenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline). The DNA binding was investigated. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to detect the cytotoxic activity of Ir1, Ir2 and Ir3, the complexes show highly active against B16 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.3 ± 0.2 μM, 3.7 ± 0.2 μM and 4.6 ± 1.1 μM, respectively. Subsequently, cellular uptake suggested that the cytotoxicity of the complexes is attributed to their differences in cellular uptake levels. In addition, complexes Ir1, Ir2 and Ir3 induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and regulate the cell cycle mediators such as cyclin D1, CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), CDK4 and p21, leading to the inhibition of B16 cells proliferation. The autophagy was investigated by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. The complexes can promote the change from LC3-I to LC3-II, up-regulate levels of Beclin-1 and down-regulate expression of p62. The complexes induced apoptosis by regulating the expression levels of related indicators such as PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase), PI3K (phosphoinositide-3 kinase), AKT (protein kinase B), Caspase, Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2), Bad (Bcl2 associated death promoter), Bax (Bcl2-associated X) and Cyto C (cytochrome C). Additionally, Ir1 exerted significant antitumor activity in the suppression of malignant melanoma proliferation in vivo. As indicated in the above results, these complexes were highly effective for malignant melanoma treatment through the intrinsic pathway and provided much insight into anticancer drugs for tumor therapy.	2022	02	08	J Inorg Biochem	Zhang	Yuanyuan
34440193	10.3390/biomedicines9080990	Nanonutraceuticals: Anti-Cancer Activity and Improved Safety of Chemotherapy by Costunolide and Its Nanoformulation against Colon and Breast Cancer.	Costunolide (COS) is a sesquiterpene lactone with anticancer properties. The present study investigated the anticancer effects of COS against the human colon (HCT116) and breast (MDA-MB-231-Luc) cancer cell lines. Inhibition of cell lines viability and IC50 of COS were assessed via an MTT assay. Furthermore, the apoptotic rate was detected by assessment of Bcl2-associated X (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein levels by flow cytometry. Xenograft mice model of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc were carried out to determine the effect of COS and its nanoparticles (COS-NPs). The results demonstrated that COS inhibited the viability of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc cells, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration value (IC50) of 39.92 µM and 100.57 µM, respectively. COS significantly increased Bax and decreased Bcl2 levels in treated cells. COS and COS-NPs, in combination with doxorubicin (DOX), significantly decreased the tumor growth of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc implants in mice. Furthermore, oral administration of COS and COS-NPs significantly decreased the viable cells and increased necrotic/apoptotic cells of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231-Luc implants. Interestingly, both COS and COS-NPs protected the cardiac muscles against DOX's cardiotoxicity. The current results indicated the promising anticancer and cardiac muscles protection of COS and COS-NPs when administered with chemotherapy.	2021	08	30	Biomedicines	El-Far	Ali H
34445685	10.3390/ijms22168980	A Combination of Celecoxib and Glucosamine Sulfate Has Anti-Inflammatory and Chondroprotective Effects: Results from an In Vitro Study on Human Osteoarthritic Chondrocytes.	This study investigated the possible anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects of a combination of celecoxib and prescription-grade glucosamine sulfate (GS) in human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes and their possible mechanism of action. Chondrocytes were treated with celecoxib (1.85 µM) and GS (9 µM), alone or in combination with <i>IL-1β</i> (10 ng/mL) and a specific nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor (BAY-11-7082, 1 µM). Gene expression and release of some pro-inflammatory mediators, metalloproteinases (<i>MMPs</i>), and type II collagen (Col2a1) were evaluated by qRT-PCR and ELISA; apoptosis and mitochondrial superoxide anion production were assessed by cytometry; B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2, antioxidant enzymes, and <i>p50</i> and <i>p65</i> NF-κB subunits were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Celecoxib and GS alone or co-incubated with <i>IL-1β</i> significantly reduced expression and release of cyclooxygenase (<i>COX)-2</i>, prostaglandin (<i>PG)E2</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-6</i>, tumor necrosis factor (<i>TNF)-α</i>, and <i>MMPs</i>, while it increased <i>Col2a1</i>, compared to baseline or <i>IL-1β</i>. Both drugs reduced apoptosis and superoxide production; reduced the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and nuclear factor erythroid; increased <i>BCL2</i>; and limited <i>p50</i> and <i>p65</i>. Celecoxib and GS combination demonstrated an increased inhibitory effect on <i>IL-1β</i> than that observed by each single treatment. Drugs effects were potentiated by pre-incubation with BAY-11-7082. Our results demonstrated the synergistic effect of celecoxib and GS on OA chondrocyte metabolism, apoptosis, and oxidative stress through the modulation of the NF-κB pathway, supporting their combined use for the treatment of OA.	2021	09	29	Int J Mol Sci	Cheleschi	Sara
34465079	10.4132/jptm.2021.07.25	Upward trend in follicular lymphoma among the Korean population: 10-year experience at a large tertiary institution.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in Western countries. However, it is relatively rare in Asia. This study examined epidemiologic characteristics of FL in South Korea, with an emphasis on recent trends of increase in cases. We retrospectively examined 239 cases of newly diagnosed FL at a large tertiary institution in Korea (Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea) between 2008 and 2017. Age-adjusted incidence rates and clinicopathological variables were analyzed, and joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify the changes. The age-adjusted incidence of FL significantly increased during the study period (p = .034), and the ratio of (relative incidence) patients with FL to patients with NHL increased from 4.28% to 9.35% in the same period. Over the 10-year study assessment duration, the proportion of patients with stage III/IV FL (p = .035) and expression of BCL2 (p = .022) or BCL6 (p = .039) significantly increased. From 2013-2017, the proportion of patients with highrisk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score increased (21.5% to 28.7%), whereas that of low-risk FLIPI decreased (55.4% to 38.6%), although those results were not statistically significant (p = .066). We found an increasing incidence of FL, with a disproportionate increase in the incidence of high-stage disease and recent changes in the clinicopathologic features of the Korean patient population.	2021	10	08	J Pathol Transl Med	Kim	Meejeong
34477080		Indurated Plaques on the Legs: Think Lymphoma.	Dear Editor, Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg-type (PCDLBCL-LT) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm. A timely diagnosis may prevent fatal outcomes; physicians should take this entity into consideration when assessing non-specific lesions on the lower limbs. We present a 69-year-old woman with a 1-month history of a firm plaque on her left leg. Physical examination revealed an asymptomatic, indurated, smooth, and erythematous plaque on the pretibial region of her left extremity (Figure 1, a). The rest of the physical examination was normal. Histological examination revealed cohesive sheets of a dense cell infiltrate in the dermis, composed of large round immunoblast-type cells with prominent nucleoli, and the presence of mitoses. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD20, Bcl2, and MUM1 (Figure 1, b-d). Additionally, c-MYC and Ki67 exhibited a 20% positivity; CD3 and CD10 were negative. The diagnosis of PCDLBCL-LT was established. Imaging and blood workup ruled out systemic involvement. Treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy was initiated, with complete tumor regression by the third cycle. The patient completed 6 cycles and has remained disease-free after 18 months. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) are lymphoproliferative disorders that appear on the skin without evidence of extracutaneous manifestations at the time of diagnosis (1). They represent 25 to 35% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas (2). In 2018, an updated version of the 2008 WHO-EORTC classification divided CBCLs into 5 subtypes: PCDLBCL-LT, primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU), and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (3). PCDLBCL-LT is the least common subtype, representing approximately 10% of all CBCLs and only 4% of all cutaneous lymphomas (2,3). Although the pathogenesis for most CBCLs is still unknown, positive serology for Lyme disease in a significant number of patients has been recognized as a probable etiologic association (4). PCDLBCL-LT is more frequent in women, and the mean age of presentation is 76 years. It usually presents as erythematous or bluish nodules, and up to 75% of the cases appears on one or both legs (1). Although infrequent, other locations have been reported, including the head, neck, trunk, and upper extremities (5). Workup should include a complete physical exam, skin biopsy, blood tests, and imaging (2,3). Histopathology shows a diffuse infiltrate in the dermis composed of large B-cells (centroblasts and/or immunoblasts) with extension to subcutaneous cellular tissue. These cells have round nuclei that are more than twice the size of normal lymphocytes, with prominent nucleoli. The immunophenotype of PCDLBCL-LT is CD20+, CD79a+, CD10-, and Bcl-6+/-, and strongly expresses Bcl-2, MUM1/IRF4, and FOX-P1 (1-3). Unlike the other indolent subtypes, PCDLBCL-LT is generally more aggressive with a poor prognosis. The 5-year disease survival rate is of approximately 50% (5). Management depends on the body surface area, location, and the patient's age and general health. To date, chemotherapy with R-CHOP remains the first line of therapy for PCDLBCL-LT, resulting in complete remission in up to 92% of cases (2). The prognostic characteristics of most PCDLBCL-LTs require timely and appropriate diagnosis and treatment.	2021	10	25	Acta Dermatovenerol Croat	Watts-Santos	Anabella
34478505	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005083	Outcomes of patients with CLL sequentially resistant to both BCL2 and BTK inhibition.	Covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's) and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax have significantly improved outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), especially those with biologically adverse disease. Patients with CLL resistant to their first targeted agent (TA) can be effectively treated with the alternative class. However, relapses are expected with second-line TA therapy, and the clinical challenge of double class-resistant disease is now emerging with increasing frequency. To define the characteristics and outcomes of patients with double class-resistant disease, we retrospectively analyzed 17 patients who developed progressive disease (PD) on both TA classes for CLL (venetoclax, then BTKi, n=12; BTKi, then venetoclax, n = 5). The cohort was heavily pretreated (median lines of prior therapy, 4) and enriched for adverse disease genetics (complex karyotype, 12 of 12 tested [100%]; del(17p)/TP53 mutations, 15 of 17 [88%]). The median time to progression on prior venetoclax was 24 months (range, 6-94 months) and was 25 months (range, 1-55 months) on prior BTKi. Progression on second-line TA was manifest as progressive CLL in 11 patients and as Richter transformation in 6. The median overall survival after progression on second-line TA was 3.6 months (95% confidence interval, 2-11 months). Patients with double class-resistant CLL have a dismal prognosis, representing a group of high unmet need.	2021	11	01	Blood Adv	Lew	Thomas E
34479596	10.1186/s13005-021-00287-x	Influences of cold atmospheric plasma on apoptosis related molecules in osteoblast-like cells in vitro.	Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has recently been identified as a novel therapeutic strategy for supporting processes of wound healing. Since CAP is additionally known to kill malignant cells, our study intends to determine the influence of CAP on crucial molecules involved in the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in osteoblast-like cells. Human osteoblast-like cells were CAP-treated for 30 and 60 s. CAP effects on critical factors related to apoptosis were studied at transcriptional and protein level using real time-PCR, immunofluorescence staining and western blot. Phalloidin / DAPI staining was used for analyzing the cell morphology. In addition, apoptotic outcomes of CAP were displayed using flow cytometry analysis. For studying intracellular signaling pathways, MAP kinase MEK 1/2 and PI3K were blocked. Finally, the effects of CAP on caspase-3 activity were examined using a caspase-3 assay. CAP treatment resulted in a significant downregulation of p53 and apoptotic protease activating factor (APAF)-1, caspase (CASP)9, CASP3, BCL2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)1, and B-Cell Lymphoma (BCL)2 mRNA expression at 1 d. An inhibitory effect of CAP on apoptotic genes was also shown under inflammatory and apoptotic conditions. Nuclear translocation of p53 was determined in CAP treated cells at the early and late stage, after 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h. p53 and APAF-1 protein levels were reduced at 1 d, visualized by immunofluorescence and western blot, respectively. Moreover, a morphological cytoskeleton modification was observed after CAP treatment at 1 d. Further, both CAP-treated and untreated (control) cells remained equally vital as detected by flow cytometry analysis. Interestingly, CAP-associated downregulation of CASP9 and CASP3 mRNA gene expression was also visible after blocking MAP kinase and PI3K. Finally, CAP led to a decrease in CASP3 activity in osteoblast-like cells under normal and apoptotic conditions. Our in vitro-study demonstrated, that CAP decreases apoptosis related molecules in osteoblast-like cells, underlining a beneficial effect on hard-tissue cells.	2021	09	07	Head Face Med	Eggers	Benedikt
34488262	10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20201010-00568	[Changes and significance of autophagy in rat lung injury induced by gas explosion].	<b>Objective:</b> To explore the changes and significance of autophagy in acute lung injury (ALI) induced by gas explosion in rats. <b>Methods:</b> In February 2018, the gas explosion in underground coal mine was simulated by large tunnel explosion experiment system, SD rats were randomly divided into control group and 6 distance groups (40 m, 80 m, 120 m, 160 m, 200 m, 240 m) with 18 rats in each group. The respiratory function of rats 24 h before and after explosion was detected. Post-explosion rats were anesthetized and sacrificed, histopathological changes of lung were observed by HE staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the in situ expression of autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B) . The expression levels of autophagy related gene 12 (Atg12) , LC3B, P62, lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp2) , B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl2 interaction protein (Beclin-1) were detected by Western blot. <b>Results:</b> After gas explosion, the rats in 80 m distance point group had the hightest mortality (<i>n</i>=13, 72.22%) and the most severe lung injury degree, and the histopathological scores was (4.00±0.00) point. After gas explosion, the minute ventilation volume (MVb) , maximum inspiratory flow rate (PIFb) and maximum expiratory flow rate (PEFb) of rats were lower than before the gas explosion (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) . The respiratory frequency of rats in 80 m, 200 m, and 240 m distance point groups were significantly higher than that in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) . The expression levels of LC3B in 40 m, 80 m, 120 m, 160 m, and 200 m distance point groups were higher than that in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) .

The relative expression levels of P62 in 80 m, 160 m and 200 m distance point groups were lower than that in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) . The relative expression levels of Lamp2 and Bcl-2 in lung tissues of rats in all distance groups except 240 m distance group were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) . <b>Conclusion:</b> Gas explosion could induce increased autophagy in lung tissues of ALI rats. Autophagy-related signaling pathway could be involved in the pathophysiological process of ALI in rats caused by gas explosion, then the autophagy and the severity of the lesion showed a significant positive correlation. <b>目的：</b> 探索细胞自噬在瓦斯爆炸致大鼠急性肺损伤（ALI）中的改变及其意义。 <b>方法：</b> 于2018年2月，通过大型巷道爆炸实验系统模拟煤矿井下瓦斯爆炸，将SD大鼠随机分为对照组以及6个距离组（40 m、80 m、120 m、160 m、200 m、240 m），每组18只。于爆炸前、爆炸后24 h检测各组大鼠呼吸功能，麻醉处死大鼠后，通过HE染色观察肺组织病理学变化；免疫组化检测自噬标志蛋白B型微管相关蛋白1轻链-3（LC3B）原位表达情况；Western blot检测自噬相关基因12（Atg12）、LC3B、P62、溶酶体相关膜蛋白2（Lamp2）、B细胞淋巴瘤/白血病-2蛋白（Bcl-2）和Bcl-2相互作用蛋白（Beclin-1）的表达水平。 <b>结果：</b> 瓦斯爆炸后，80 m距离组大鼠死亡率最高（13只，72.22%），肺组织损伤程度最严重，组织病理学评分为（4.00±0.00）分。瓦斯爆炸后，大鼠每分通气量（MVb）、最大吸气流速（PIFb）和最大呼气流速（PEFb）均低于爆炸前（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05），80 m、200 m和240 m距离组大鼠呼吸频率明显高于对照组（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）；40 m、80 m、120 m、160 m和200 m距离组大鼠肺组织LC3B相对表达量均高于对照组（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。各距离组大鼠肺组织中Atg12和LC3BⅡ/Ⅰ相对表达水平高于对照组（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05），40 m、80 m、120 m和160 m距离组大鼠肺组织中Beclin1相对表达量明显高于对照组（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05），80 m、160 m和200 m距离组大鼠肺组织中P62相对表达量低于对照组（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05），除240 m距离组外其余各距离组大鼠肺组织中Lamp2和Bcl-2相对表达水平低于对照组（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。 <b>结论：</b> 瓦斯爆炸致ALI大鼠肺组织中细胞自噬作用增强，细胞自噬及其信号调控通路参与了瓦斯爆炸致大鼠ALI的病理生理过程，且损伤越重，自噬程度越为明显。.	2021	09	08	Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi	Hou	R Y
34489160	10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.08.018	LncRNA MIAT knockdown alleviates oxygen-glucose deprivation‑induced cardiomyocyte injury by regulating JAK2/STAT3 pathway via miR-181a-5p.	Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common heart disease with high incidence and mortality. Myocardial ischemia is the main type of CAD, which negatively affects health worldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function and mechanism of myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) in myocardial ischemia. Human cardiomyocytes (HCM) were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to set the in vitro model and mouse myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) was set for in vivo model. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence analysis. Inflammatory cytokines levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene and protein expressions were identified by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction or Western blotting. The interaction of MIAT, miR-181a-5p, and janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was identified by dual-luciferase report assay. Mouse heart tissues histopathological condition were observed by hematoxylin and eosin assays. Expression of MIAT and JAK2 were increased in OGD-treated HCM and mice of I/R model group, and miR-181a-5p was decreased. MIAT silencing could reverse the OGD treatment induced cell proliferation inhibition, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl2-associated X (Bax) levels increased, while those of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and mitochondria's cyt-C decreased. Besides, MIAT knockdown attenuated the OGD-induced increase of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 levels. Moreover, MIAT targeted miR-181a-5p to enhance the expression of JAK2 and signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and miR-181a-5p overexpression promoted proliferation, whereas it inhibited apoptosis in OGD-induced cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the regulatory effects of MIAT knockdown in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory injury was reversed by inhibition of miR-181a-5p or overexpression of JAK2 in OGD-treated HCM. Knockdown of MIAT reduced myocardial injury caused by I/R treatment in vivo. MIAT knockdown inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by regulating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway via targeting miR-181a-5p in myocardial ischemia model. MIAT can be a possible therapeutic target for controlling the progression of myocardial ischemia.	2022	01	07	J Cardiol	Tan	Jian-Kai

Doxorubicin (Dox) induces senescence in numerous cancer cell types, but these senescent cancer cells relapse again if they are not eliminated. On this principle, we investigated the apoptotic effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the active ingredient of <i>Nigella sativa</i> seeds and costunolide (COS), the active ingredient of <i>Costus speciosus</i>, on the senescent colon (Sen-HCT116) and senescent breast (Sen-MCF7) cancer cell lines in reference to their corresponding proliferative cells to rapidly eliminate the senescent cancer cells. The senescence markers of Sen-HCT116 and Sen-MCF7 were determined by a significant decrease in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and significant increases in SA-β-gal, p53, and p21 levels. Then proliferative, Sen-HCT116, and Sen-MCF7 cells were subjected to either TQ (50 µM) or COS (30 µM), the Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), caspase 3 mRNA expression and its activity were established. Results revealed that TQ significantly increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in HCT116 + Dox5 + TQ, MCF7 + TQ, and MCF7 + Dox5 + TQ compared with their corresponding controls. COS significantly increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in HCT116 + Dox5 + TQ and MCF7 + Dox5 + TQ compared with their related controls. Also, TQ and COS were significantly increased caspase 3 activity and cell proliferation of Sen-HCT116 and Sen-MCF7. The data revealed a higher sensitivity of senescent cells to TQ or COS than their corresponding proliferative cells.	2021	10	11	Integr Cancer Ther	El-Far	Ali H
34497195	10.11406/rinketsu.62.1085	[Molecular pathogenesis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia].	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a rare type of lymphoid malignancy among Japanese. Its clinical course is indolent, and the prognosis is good. The two types of CLL based on the mutation status of the IgH gene V segment have been documented in the literature. Then, the del (17p)/TP53 subtype is emphasized, and the treatment strategy for the three subtypes differs. Recent knowledge on molecular pathogenesis facilitated the usage of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and BCL2 inhibitors for the treatment of CLL. A better response can be obtained with the use of these novel agents, resulting in a higher rate of negativity for measurable residual disease (MRD). The treatment strategy based on MRD negativity and the treatment outcomes of CLL will improve in future.	2021	09	10	Rinsho Ketsueki	Suzuki	Ritsuro
34500469	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004635	Aggressive B-cell lymphoma cases with 11q aberration patterns indicate a spectrum beyond Burkitt-like lymphoma.	The recent characterization of a group of non-MYC rearranged aggressive B-cell lymphomas, resembling Burkitt lymphoma (BL), characteristically harboring a telomeric 11q loss or combined 11q proximal gains/loss pattern has led to the introduction of the provisional entity of Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration (BLL-11q). Prompted by the discovery of a telomeric 11q loss in an HIV+ high-grade B-cell lymphoma patient, we investigated an extended cohort of aggressive B-cell lymphomas, enriched for cases with histopathological features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, including double- and triple-hit lymphomas (n = 47), for 11q loss/combined 11q proximal gains/loss pattern by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We provide first evidence that 11q aberrations can be found in both BLL in the context of an underlying HIV infection as well as in high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements. We therefore propose that the clinicopathological spectrum of malignancies carrying this aberration may be broader than previously assumed.	2022	01	06	Blood Adv	Gebauer	Niklas

In the current study, we explored the roles and underlying mechanisms of microRNA-342-3p in nonsmall cell lung cancer via gain- and loss-of-function analyses. We used quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays to measure the expression levels of microRNA-342-3p in nonsmall-cell lung cancer and B-cell lymphoma-2. Furthermore, we used small interfering RNA and RNA mimics to analyze the functions and underlying mechanisms of microRNA-342-3p in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to evaluate the direct binding site of the 5'-untranslated region of B-cell lymphoma-2 targeted by microRNA-342-3p. We found that the expression of microRNA-342-3p was significantly lower in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells and tissues than in normal cells and tissues. The upregulation of microRNA-342-3p suppressed cell proliferation while promoting apoptosis in H1975, H460, and H226 cells. The overexpression of microRNA-342-3p in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells led to the downregulation of mRNA and protein levels in B-cell lymphoma-2 cells. Thus, B-cell lymphoma-2 was identified as a direct target of microRNA-342-3p. These findings indicate that microRNA-342-3p inhibits the growth of nonsmall cell lung cancer by repressing the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2, which suggests that microRNA-342-3p could be a potential target for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer.	2022	01	24	Technol Cancer Res Treat	Chen	Zhongjie

34534532	10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174505	7-[[(4-methyl-2-pyridinyl)amino](2-pyridinyl)methyl]-8-quinolinol (compound 30666) inhibits enhancer activity and reduces B-cell lymphoma growth - A question of specificity.	B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is among the ten most common malignancies. Survival rates range from very poor to over 90% and highly depend on the stage and subtype. Characteristic features of NHL are recurrent translocations juxtaposing an oncogene (e.g. MYC, BCL2) to the enhancers in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus. Survival and proliferation of many B-cell lymphomas depend on the expression of the translocated oncogene. Thus, targeting IGH enhancers as an anti-lymphoma treatment seems a promising strategy. Recently, a small molecule - 7-[[(4-methyl-2-pyridinyl)amino](2-pyridinyl)methyl]-8-quinolinol (compound 30666) was identified to decrease activity of the Eμ enhancer and reduce the expression of translocated oncogenes in multiple myeloma and some NHL cell lines (Dolloff, 2019). Here, we aimed to test the effect of compound 30666 in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and shed light on its mechanism of action. We report that both IGH-translocation positive NHL cells as well as IGH-translocation negative B cells and non-B cell controls treated with compound 30666 exhibited consistent growth inhibition. A statistically significant increase in cell percentage in sub-G1 phase of cell cycle was observed, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Compound 30666 downregulated MYC levels in BL cell lines and altered IGH enhancer RNA expression. Moreover, a global decrease of H3K27ac and an increase of H3K4me1 was observed upon 30666 treatment, which suggests switching enhancers to a poised or primed state. Altogether, our findings indicate that 30666 inhibitor affects enhancer activity but might not be as specific for IGH enhancers as previously reported.	2022	01	28	Eur J Pharmacol	Kasprzyk	Marta Elżbieta
34551886	10.1016/j.clml.2021.07.029	A Phase II Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.	Venetoclax is a selective BCL-2 inhibitor with clinical activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Combinations of venetoclax with agents that have complementary mechanisms of action may improve venetoclax efficacy in RRMM. This study evaluated venetoclax with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (VenPd) in RRMM. This phase II open label study (NCT03567616) evaluated VenPd in patients with RRMM who had received ≥ 1 prior therapy and were refractory to lenalidomide. Venetoclax was administered orally daily for days 1 to 28, pomalidomide was administered orally daily for days 1 to 21, and dexamethasone was administered weekly for each 28-day cycle. The primary objective was to characterize the safety and tolerability of VenPd. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and pharmacokinetics. The study was terminated early due to partial clinical hold and decision to pursue biomarker driven strategy. Eight patients were enrolled. Patients had a median age of 67.5 years. All patients received 400 mg venetoclax; 4 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities and the dose was not escalated. All patients had a grade ≥ 3 adverse event, and the most common was neutropenia (n = 6); cytopenias were the most prevalent adverse events. Five patients (63%) had a confirmed response, and the median duration of response was 12.9 months. The median progression-free survival was 10.5 months. Given the limited enrollment, no clear safety or efficacy conclusions about VenPd can be drawn. Preliminary safety data, particularly the occurrence of cytopenias, can be used to guide dosing strategies for future combinations of venetoclax with immunomodulatory agents.	2022	02	16	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Gasparetto	Cristina
34555842	10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003949	A novel 3D culture model recapitulates primary FL B-cell features and promotes their survival.	Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (B-NHL) mainly develop within lymph nodes as aggregates of tumor cells densely packed with their surrounding microenvironment, creating a tumor niche specific to each lymphoma subtypes. In vitro preclinical models mimicking biomechanical forces, cellular microenvironment, and 3D organization of B-cell lymphomas remain scarce, while all these parameters are key determinants of lymphomagenesis and drug resistance. Using a microfluidic method based on cell encapsulation inside permeable, elastic, and hollow alginate microspheres, we developed a new tunable 3D model incorporating lymphoma B cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and/or tonsil stromal cells (TSC). Under 3D confinement, lymphoma B cells were able to form cohesive spheroids resulting from overexpression of ECM components. Moreover, lymphoma B cells and TSC dynamically formed self-organized 3D spheroids favoring tumor cell growth. 3D culture induced resistance to the classical chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, but not to the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199, identifying this approach as a relevant in vitro model to assess the activity of therapeutic agents in B-NHL. RNA-sequence analysis highlighted the synergy of 3D, ECM, and TSC in upregulating similar pathways in malignant B cells in vitro than those overexpressed in primary lymphoma B cells in situ. Finally, our 3D model including ECM and TSC allowed long-term in vitro survival of primary follicular lymphoma B cells. In conclusion, we propose a new high-throughput 3D model mimicking lymphoma tumor niche and making it possible to study the dynamic relationship between lymphoma B cells and their microenvironment and to screen new anti-cancer drugs.	2022	01	06	Blood Adv	Lamaison	Claire
34563576	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.095	The crystal structure of the domain-swapped dimer of onconase highlights some catalytic and antitumor activity features of the enzyme.	Onconase (ONC) is a monomeric amphibian ""pancreatic-type"" RNase endowed with remarkable anticancer activity. ONC spontaneously forms traces of a dimer (ONC-D) in solution, while larger amounts can be formed when ONC is lyophilized from mildly acidic solutions. Here, we report the crystal structure of ONC-D and analyze its catalytic and antitumor activities in comparison to ONC. ONC-D forms via the three-dimensional swapping of the N-terminal α-helix between two monomers, but it displays a significantly different quaternary structure from that previously modeled [Fagagnini A et al., 2017, Biochem J 474, 3767-81], and based on the crystal structure of the RNase A N-terminal swapped dimer. ONC-D presents a variable quaternary assembly deriving from a variable open interface, while it retains a catalytic activity that is similar to that of ONC. Notably, ONC-D displays antitumor activity against two human melanoma cell lines, although it exerts a slightly lower cytostatic effect than the monomer. The inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation by ONC or ONC-D is associated with the reduction of the expression of the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), as well as of the total expression and phosphorylation of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-3. Phosphorylation is inhibited in both STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 key-residues, as well as in its upstream tyrosine-kinase Src. Consequently, both ONC species should exert their anti-cancer action by inhibiting the pro-tumor pleiotropic STAT3 effects deriving either by its phospho-tyrosine activation or by its non-canonical signaling pathways. Both ONC species, indeed, increase the portion of A375 cells undergoing apoptotic cell death. This study expands the variety of RNase domain-swapped dimeric structures, underlining the unpredictability of the open interface arrangement upon domain swapping. Structural data also offer valuable insights to analyze the differences in the measured ONC or ONC-D biological activities.	2021	12	15	Int J Biol Macromol	Gotte	Giovanni
34568060	10.3389/fonc.2021.729106	Case Report: Contrasting BCL2 Upregulation With Venetoclax in a Case of Refractory Lymphomatoid Papulosis and Progressive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.	A 57-year-old man affected by high-risk progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), primary resistant to first-line chemoimmunotherapy, developed a type A lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) during a second progression of CLL. The two blood tumor entities were clonally unrelated. LyP presented with a diffuse (&gt;90% body surface area) cutaneous rash and was characterized by intensely pruriginous dusky nodules (n = 10) and red flat-topped papules (n = 60). No response to topical corticosteroids and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy was observed. In order to effectively treat progressive <i>TP53</i>-mutated CLL, the potent BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, was initiated with no treatment-related complications. While CLL only achieved a partial response, a complete remission of LyP-associated cutaneous rash and of the intractable pruritus was obtained within 2 months from venetoclax initiation. BCL2 immunostaining of the original cutaneous specimen showed a strong over-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, restricted to CD30<sup>+</sup> lymphoid cells and reactive microenvironment. At 12 months follow-up, the patient is still in complete remission of LyP. Our findings underline the probable pathogenic role of BCL2 in LyP and the potential therapeutic efficacy of venetoclax for the treatment of this primary cutaneous CD30<sup>+</sup> lymphoproliferative disorder, especially in the setting of severe and refractory disease.	2021	09	29	Front Oncol	Guarente	Valerio
34576095	10.3390/ijms22189924	Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Exacerbate Allergic Airway Inflammation via TXNIP Upregulation in a Mouse Model of Asthma.	Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) are widely used in industrial and medicinal fields and in various consumer products, and their increasing use has led to an increase in the number of toxicity studies; however, studies investigating the underlying toxicity mechanism have been rare. In this study, we evaluated potential toxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs exposure on lungs as well as the development of asthma through the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of asthma. Furthermore, we also investigated the associated toxic mechanism. TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs caused pulmonary toxicity by exacerbating the inflammatory response, indicated by an increase in the number and level of inflammatory cells and mediators, respectively. OVA-induced asthma exposed mice to TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs led to significant increases in inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and airway hyperresponsiveness compared with those in non-exposed asthmatic mice. This was also accompanied by increased inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in the lung tissues. Additionally, TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and the expressions of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), phospho-apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, Bcl2-associated X, and cleaved-caspase 3 were escalated in the lungs of asthmatic mice compared with those in non-exposed asthmatic mice. These responses were consistent with in vitro results obtained using human airway epithelial cells. TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs treated cells exhibited an increase in the mRNA and protein expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α with an elevation of TXNIP signaling compared to non-treated cells. Moreover, pathophysiological changes induced by TiO<sub>2</sub>NP treatment were significantly decreased by TXNIP knockdown in airway epithelial cells. Overall, TiO<sub>2</sub>NP exposure induced toxicological changes in the respiratory tract and exacerbated the development of asthma via activation of the TXNIP-apoptosis pathway. These results provide insights into the underlying mechanism of TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-mediated respiratory toxicity.	2021	10	22	Int J Mol Sci	Lim	Je-Oh
34576319	10.3390/ijms221810157	BH3 Mimetics in Hematologic Malignancies.	Hematologic malignancies (HM) comprise diverse cancers of lymphoid and myeloid origin, including lymphomas (approx. 40%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, approx. 15%), multiple myeloma (MM, approx. 15%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, approx. 10%), and many other diseases. Despite considerable improvement in treatment options and survival parameters in the new millennium, many patients with HM still develop chemotherapy‑refractory diseases and require re-treatment. Because frontline therapies for the majority of HM (except for CLL) are still largely based on classical cytostatics, the relapses are often associated with defects in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways and anti-apoptotic blocks exemplified, respectively, by mutations or deletion of the <i>TP53</i> tumor suppressor, and overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family. BCL2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics represent a novel class of pro-apoptotic anti-cancer agents with a unique mode of action-direct targeting of mitochondria independently of <i>TP53</i> gene aberrations. Consequently, BH3 mimetics can effectively eliminate even non-dividing malignant cells with adverse molecular cytogenetic alterations. Venetoclax, the nanomolar inhibitor of BCL2 anti-apoptotic protein has been approved for the therapy of CLL and AML. Numerous venetoclax-based combinatorial treatment regimens, next-generation BCL2 inhibitors, and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein inhibitors, which are another class of BH3 mimetics with promising preclinical results, are currently being tested in several clinical trials in patients with diverse HM. These pivotal trials will soon answer critical questions and concerns about these innovative agents regarding not only their anti-tumor efficacy but also potential side effects, recommended dosages, and the optimal length of therapy as well as identification of reliable biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance. Effective harnessing of the full therapeutic potential of BH3 mimetics is a critical mission as it may directly translate into better management of the aggressive forms of HM and could lead to significantly improved survival parameters and quality of life in patients with urgent medical needs.	2021	11	01	Int J Mol Sci	Klener	Pavel
34581757	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004619	Phase 1b study of the BET protein inhibitor RO6870810 with venetoclax and rituximab in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins are transcriptional activators for multiple oncogenic processes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including MYC, BCL2, E2F, and toll-like receptor signaling. We report results of a phase 1b dose-escalation study of the novel, subcutaneous BET inhibitor RO6870810 (RO) combined with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, and rituximab, in recurrent/refractory DLBCL. RO was delivered for 14 days of a 21-day cycle, whereas venetoclax was delivered continuously. A 3 + 3 escalation design was used to determine the safety of the RO+venetoclax doublet; rituximab was added in later cohorts. Thirty-nine patients were treated with a median of 2.8 cycles (range, 1-11). Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 febrile neutropenia, grade 4 diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia for the doublet; and grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia and grade 4 diarrhea when rituximab was added. The doublet maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 0.65 mg/kg RO+600 mg venetoclax; for RO+venetoclax+rituximab, the MTDs were 0.45 mg/kg, 600 mg, and 375 mg/m2, respectively. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (28%) and anemia and thrombocytopenia (23% each). Responses were seen in all cohorts and molecular subtypes. Sustained decreases in CD11b on monocytes indicated pharmacodynamic activity of RO. Overall response rate according to modified Lugano criteria was 38.5%; 48% of responses lasted for ≥180 days. Complete response was observed in 8 patients (20.5%). Optimization of the treatment schedule and a better understanding of predictors of response would be needed to support broader clinical use. This trial is registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03255096.	2021	11	29	Blood Adv	Dickinson	Michael
34610523	10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105552	Blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma in palatine tonsil.	Blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive and extremely rare malignancy. MCL may be diagnosed in lymph nodes and/or extranodal sites exhibiting a poor prognosis. MCL with primary presentation in palatine tonsils has been rarely reported. Herein, we report the case of a 73-year-old man with a painless nodular mass on the right palatine tonsil. A biopsy was performed, and microscopic analysis revealed a neoplasm composed of small to medium sized lymphocytes with finely dispersed chromatin, roundish nucleus and many mitoses. The tumor cells were positive for CD20 (L26), CD5 (4C7), Cyclin D1 (EP12), Bcl2 (124) and Ki-67 (MIB-1; 90%), and negative for Bcl6 (PG-B6p), MUM1 (MUM1p) and CD3 (Polyclonal). These findings led to the diagnosis of blastoid variant of MCL. Diagnostic workup with computed tomography scan excluded other sites of disease. The patient was treated successfully with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (mini-CHOP regimen). Although the blastoid variant of MCL is rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of rapid-growing masses in the palatine tonsil.	2022	02	04	Oral Oncol	Valente	Vitor Bonetti
34625994	10.1002/ajh.26367	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2022 update on diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most frequent types of leukemia. It typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that interfere with the regulation of proliferation and of apoptosis in clonal B-cells. The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as typical B-cell markers. The clinical staging systems provide prognostic information by using the results of physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers provide additional prognostic information. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene predict resistance to chemoimmunotherapy and a shorter time to progression with most targeted therapies. The CLL international prognostic index integrates genetic, biological, and clinical variables to identify distinct risk groups of patients with CLL. Only patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. When treatment is indicated, several therapeutic options exist: a combination of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax with obinutuzumab, monotherapy with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, or chemoimmunotherapy. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds 3 years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using an alternative regimen. Patients with a del(17p) or TP53 mutation are usually resistant to chemotherapy and should, therefore, be treated with targeted agents. Combinations of targeted agents are now being investigated to create efficient, potentially curative therapies of CLL with fixed duration. One of the most relevant questions currently addressed in clinical trials is the comparison of monotherapies with BTK inhibitors with fixed duration combination therapies. Moreover, the optimal sequencing of targeted therapies remains to be determined. Alternative therapies are needed for patients with BTK and BCL2 inhibitor double-refractory disease.	2022	01	03	Am J Hematol	Hallek	Michael
34633547	10.1007/s00894-021-04924-9	Difference in the binding mechanisms of ABT-263/43b with Bcl-xL/Bcl-2: computational perspective on the accurate binding free energy analysis.	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia gene-2(Bcl-2) protein family known for regulating cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death is highly expressed in a variety of cancers. Among them, the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 are two essential proteins in the Bcl-2 family. In the present work, the differences in binding modes as between the two proteins and two ligands ABT-263/43b were investigated and compared. And the computational alanine scanning combined with the recently developed interaction entropy (AS-IE) method was employed for predicting their binding free energies and finding those amino acids that were more critical during the binding process. The result showed that the binding free energy calculated by the AS-IE method was more in line with experimental values than the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method. Besides, no significant difference was found between Bcl-xL and ABT-263/43b in the binding free energy, which Bcl-xL showed slightly weaker binding free energy to 43b because of the fewer number of key residues with interactions. Nonetheless, compared with the Bcl-2 and 43b complex, the Bcl-2 and ABT-263 system had greater number of key residues interacting with ABT-263, in particular, contribute favorably, resulting in a stronger binding ability for the Bcl-2 and ABT-263 systems. The van der Waals and hydrogen bond contributions were significant in the four protein-ligand complexes. Overall, Tyr108 was found to be the common key residues in the Bcl-xL-ligand complex, while Tyr105, Glu100, and Glu143 were established as the common key residue in the Bcl-2-ligand systems. We hope that the predicted hot spot residues and their energy distributions can guide the design of peptide and small-molecule drugs targeting Bcl-xL and Bcl-2.	2022	02	25	J Mol Model	Li	Hao
34634256	10.1016/S2352-3026(21)00273-8	Venetoclax with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R as initial therapy for patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma: a single-arm, multicentre, phase 1 study.	Dose-adjusted EPOCH-R (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab) is a front-line treatment for patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Bcl-2 is associated with chemoresistance due to BCL2 gene rearrangement or protein overexpression and is antagonised by venetoclax. We aimed to assess the safety of venetoclax with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R as initial therapy in aggressive B-cell lymphoma. We conducted a single-arm, phase 1 study across seven treatment centres in the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years with histologically confirmed, previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with double-hit or not otherwise specified, or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, with Ann Arbor stage II-IV and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Participants received six cycles of oral venetoclax 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg once daily for 10 days per cycle with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R (one cycle every 3 weeks; baseline doses were intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, intravenous etoposide 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-4, oral prednisone 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily on days 1-5, intravenous vincristine 0·4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-4, intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 5, and intravenous doxorubicin 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-4). A subsequent cohort received venetoclax 600 mg once daily for 5 days per cycle. The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and the recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax. Analyses were done per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036904, and enrolment is now closed. Between Feb 3, 2017, and June 4, 2019, 34 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 30 were enrolled and received venetoclax with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R. The median patient age was 64·0 years (IQR 51·6-69·4). The maximum tolerated dose was 800 mg for 10 days and the established recommended phase 2 dose was 600 mg for 5 days due to tolerability for treatment duration. One (3%) of 30 patients had a dose-limiting toxicity in cycle one (grade 4 thrombocytopenia with 800 mg dose). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were cytopenias (28 [93%] of 30 patients); febrile neutropenia occurred in 19 (63%) patients. Grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse events included hypophosphataemia (n=10), hypokalaemia (n=7), and hyperglycaemia (n=5). Serious adverse events included infection (n=7) and gastrointestinal toxicities including abdominal pain (n=3), colonic perforation (n=1), and small intestinal obstruction (n=1). There was one treatment-related death (sepsis). Overall response rate was 96·7% (95% CI 82·8-99·9); 28 (93·3% [77·9-99·2]) of 30 patients had complete response and one (3·3% [0·1-17·2]) had a partial response. Venetoclax with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R showed an acceptable safety profile at the recommended phase 2 dose and had encouraging preliminary activity in this population at high risk of adverse outcomes, and is worthy of further study. The combination is being investigated in Alliance 051701 (NCT03984448). Genentech.	2021	11	12	Lancet Haematol	Rutherford	Sarah C
34638779	10.3390/ijms221910442	B Cell Lymphoma 2: A Potential Therapeutic Target for Cancer Therapy.	Defects in the apoptosis mechanism stimulate cancer cell growth and survival. B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) is an anti-apoptotic molecule that plays a central role in apoptosis. Bcl-2 is the founding constituent of the Bcl-2 protein family of apoptosis controllers, the primary apoptosis regulators linked with cancer. Bcl-2 has been identified as being over-expressed in several cancers. Bcl-2 is induced by protein kinases and several signaling molecules which stimulate cancer development. Identifying the important function played by Bcl-2 in cancer progression and development, and treatment made it a target related to therapy for multiple cancers. Among the various strategies that have been proposed to block Bcl-2, BH3-mimetics have appeared as a novel group of compounds thanks to their favorable effects on many cancers within several clinical settings. Because of the fundamental function of Bcl-2 in the regulation of apoptosis, the Bcl-2 protein is a potent target for the development of novel anti-tumor treatments. Bcl-2 inhibitors have been used against several cancers and provide a pre-clinical platform for testing novel therapeutic drugs. Clinical trials of multiple investigational agents targeting Bcl-2 are ongoing. This review discusses the role of Bcl-2 in cancer development; it could be exploited as a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat various types of cancers. We further highlight the therapeutic activity of Bcl-2 inhibitors and their implications for the therapeutic management of cancer.	2021	10	27	Int J Mol Sci	Alam	Manzar
34669537	10.1177/09603271211051597	Vinpocetine attenuates fluoxetine-induced liver damage in rats; Role of Nrf2 and PPAR-γ.	Fluoxetine (FLX) has been widely used as first-line treatment in cases of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Although its safety has been approved, the use of FLX was associated with liver injury and chronic liver disease. Vinpocetine (Vinpo), a nootropic drug, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Vinpo on FLX-induced liver damage pointing to the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Rats were randomized to four groups: control group, Vinpo group (20 mg/kg/day; orally), FLX group (10 mg/kg/day; orally), and Vinpo + FLX group. FLX-induced liver damage was evidenced through elevated liver function biomarkers and induced hepatic histopathological changes. Concurrent Vinpo treatment resulted in a significant decrease in hepatotoxicity biomarkers and histopathological alterations. FLX-induced oxidative stress and inflammation were attenuated by Vinpo. In addition, Vinpo attenuated the hepatic NRF2 and HO-1 levels and up-regulated PPAR-γ expression. Moreover, FLX elevated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) mRNA expression and decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) mRNA expression were markedly reversed by Vinpo. Vinpo possesses ameliorative effects against FLX-induced liver injury in rats. This effect may be due to attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, in addition to upregulation of PPAR-γ expression.	2022	03	07	Hum Exp Toxicol	Mohamed Kamel	Gellan Alaa

Selenium deficiency is thought to be associated with the occurrence of gestational complications. However, the underlying mechanism of selenium deficiency impairs placental function remains unclear. In this study, female mice were separately supplemented with a Se-deficient (0.02 mg/kg Se) or control diet (0.2 mg/kg Se) for 12 weeks before mating and throughout gestation. Maternal liver and placentas were collected at embryonic day 15.5 and analyzed for Se content. Oxidative stress status, proliferation capability, autophagy, and apoptosis of the placenta were determined. We found that maternal selenium deficiency decreased placental Se concentration and some antioxidant selenoproteins expressions. The concentrations of catalase and glutathione in selenium-deficient placentas were reduced, along with an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. Selenium deficiency inhibited the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Autophagosomes, autophagolysosomes, and upregulation of autophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha II (LC3B), Beclin1, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and Parkin were found in the selenium-deficient trophoblasts. Autophagic substrate p62/sequestosome 1 was surprisingly increased, indicating autophagy flux dysfunction. Selenium deficiency increased expressions of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase-9/-3, and decreased the B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) level. Moreover, typical apoptotic ultrastructure and apoptosis-positive cells were observed in the selenium-deficient placenta. Our results suggested that maternal selenium deficiency impaired placental proliferation, induced autophagy dysfunction and apoptosis via increasing oxidative stress, and the Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway involved in this process. This study revealed a novel mechanism by which maternal selenium deficiency caused impairment of the placenta.	2022	02	28	Metallomics	Li	Mengdi
34671837	10.1007/s00292-021-01011-x	[Genetic evolution of in situ follicular neoplasia to t(14;18)-positive aggressive B-cell lymphoma].	In situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN) is a t(14;18)(q32;q21)<sup>+</sup> precursor lesion of follicular lymphoma (FL), which in turn can transform into diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma (DLBCL). For DLBCL that arise de novo, no precursor lesion is known. Given the high frequency of the t(14;18) translocation in de novo DLBCL as well, we investigated whether they can also arise from ISFN without FL as an intermediate step. To investigate the clonal evolution of ISFN to DLBCL - transformed from FL and de novo. Identification of ISFN lesions in patients with DLBCL was performed by BCL2 staining of reactive lymphoid tissues. ISFN and DLBCL were subsequently analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, clonality analyses, sequencing of the t(14;18) breakpoint, and targeted next-generation sequencing. 10 cases with paired ISFN and DLBCL samples were identified, 6 of which were de novo DLBCL and 4 transformed from FL. 3 DLBCL carried MYC-rearrangements in addition to the t(14;18) and were classified as high-grade B‑cell lymphoma (HGBL). The clonal relationship of ISFN and DLBCL/HGBL was confirmed for all cases. CREBBP, KMT2D, EZH2, TNFRSF14, and BCL2 were the genes most frequently mutated, with the distribution of private and shared mutations pointing to 2 different scenarios of clonal evolution. In most cases, DLBCL/HGBL, ISFN, and, if also present, FL had evolved divergently from a common progenitor, whereas linear evolution was less frequent. We show for the first time that t(14;18)<sup>+</sup> DLBCL/HGBL can arise directly from ISFN without FL as an intermediate step and that during this progression, divergent evolution is common. HINTERGRUND: Die in situ follikuläre Neoplasie (ISFN) ist eine t(14;18)(q32;q21)<sup>+</sup> Vorläuferläsion des follikulären Lymphoms (FL), das seinerseits in ein diffus großzelliges B‑Zell-Lymphom (DLBCL) transformieren kann. Für DLBCL, die de novo entstehen, ist keine Vorläuferläsion bekannt. Angesichts der hohen Frequenz der t(14;18)-Translokation auch in de novo DLBCL haben wir untersucht, ob diese auch ohne intermediäres FL aus der ISFN hervorgehen können. Erforschung der klonalen Evolution der ISFN zum DLBCL – transformiert aus einem FL und de novo. Die Identifikation von ISFN-Läsionen bei Patienten mit DLBCL erfolgte durch BCL2-Färbung reaktiver lymphatischer Gewebe. ISFN und DLBCL wurden anschließend mittels Fluoreszenz-in-situ-Hybridisierung, Klonalitätsanalysen, Sequenzierung des t(14;18)-Bruchpunktes und gezieltem Next Generation Sequencing analysiert. Es wurden 10 Fälle mit gepaarten ISFN- und DLBCL-Proben identifiziert, davon 6 de novo DLBCL und 4 transformiert aus einem FL. Neben der t(14;18) trugen 3 DLBCL auch MYC-Rearrangements und wurden als high-grade B‑Zell-Lymphom (HGBL) klassifiziert. In allen Fällen konnte die klonale Verwandtschaft von ISFN und DLBCL/HGBL bestätigt werden. CREBBP, KMT2D, EZH2, TNFRSF14 und BCL2 waren die am häufigsten mutierten Gene, wobei die Verteilung privater und gemeinsamer Mutationen auf 2 unterschiedliche Szenarien der klonalen Evolution schließen ließ. Meist hatten sich DLBCL/HGBL, ISFN und, falls ebenfalls vorhanden, FL divergent aus einem gemeinsamen Progenitor entwickelt, während eine lineare Evolution selten war. Wir zeigen erstmals, dass t(14;18)<sup>+</sup> DLBCL/HGBL auch ohne intermediäres FL direkt aus einer ISFN entstehen können und dass es hierbei häufig zur divergenten Evolution kommt.	2021	12	24	Pathologe	Vogelsberg	A
34680290	10.3390/cancers13205141	Richter Transformation in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Update in the Era of Novel Agents.	Richter transformation (RT) is a poorly understood complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a dismal prognosis. It is associated with a switch in histopathology and biology, generally with a transformation of the original CLL clone to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or less frequently to Hodgkin's variant of Richter transformation (HVRT). It occurs in 2-10% of CLL patients, with an incidence rate of 0.5-1% per year, and may develop in treatment-naïve patients, although it is more common following therapy. In recent years, there has been a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RT that involves the inactivation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in 50-60% of cases and the activation of aberrations of NOTCH1 and MYC pathways in about 30% of cases. Compared to the preceding CLL, 80% of cases with DLBCL-RT and 30% of HVRT harbor the same IGHV-D-J rearrangements, indicating a clonal evolution of the disease, while the remaining cases represent de novo lymphomas that are clonally unrelated. Despite advances in understanding the molecular variations and the pathogenesis of the disease, there is still no significant improvement in patient outcomes. However, if no clinical trials were designed for patients with RT in the past, now there many studies for these patients that incorporate new drugs and novel combinations that are being explored. In this review, we summarize the new information accumulated on RT with special emphasis on results involving the novel therapy tested for this entity, which represents an unmet clinical need.	2021	10	26	Cancers (Basel)	Tadmor	Tamar
34685497	10.3390/cells10102517	The Dual Role of Autophagy in Crizotinib-Treated ALK<sup>+</sup> ALCL: From the Lymphoma Cells Drug Resistance to Their Demise.	Autophagy has been described as harboring a dual role in cancer development and therapy. Depending on the context, it can exert either pro-survival or pro-death functions. Here, we review what is known about autophagy in crizotinib-treated ALK<sup>+</sup> ALCL. We first present our main findings on the role and regulation of autophagy in these cells. Then, we provide literature-driven hypotheses that could explain mechanistically the pro-survival properties of autophagy in crizotinib-treated bulk and stem-like ALK<sup>+</sup> ALCL cells. Finally, we discuss how the potentiation of autophagy, which occurs with combined therapies (ALK and BCL2 or ALK and RAF1 co-inhibition), could convert it from a survival mechanism to a pro-death process.	2021	12	13	Cells	Espinos	Estelle
34698437	10.1111/jcmm.16999	Modified conditioning regimen with chidamide and high-dose rituximab for triple-hit lymphoma.	Triple-hit lymphoma (THL), which is classified into high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6, presents aggressive biological behaviour. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) is considered to be one of the recommended treatment options. Here, we reported 3 THL patients received carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and cyclophosphamide (BEAC) combined with chidamide and high-dose rituximab conditioning regimen and found that this conditioning showed good efficacy and tolerance without increase of adverse events.	2022	03	15	J Cell Mol Med	Kang	Junnan
34706861	10.1136/bjophthalmol-2021-319580	Prevalence and prognostic value of <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CD79B</i> mutations in ocular adnexal large B-cell lymphoma: a reclassification of ocular adnexal large B-cell lymphoma.	To (1) reclassify ocular adnexal large B-cell lymphomas (OA-LBCLs) per 2016 WHO lymphoma classification and (2) determine the prevalence of <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CD79B</i> mutations and their association with clinical parameters among OA-LBCLs. This study is a retrospective analysis of all OA-LBCLs diagnosed in Denmark between 1980 and 2018. Medical records and tissue samples were retrieved. Thirty-four OA-LBCLs were included. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation and Epstein-Barr-encoded RNA in situ hybridisation were used for the reclassification. Mutational status was established by allele-specific PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Primary endpoints were overall survival, disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Two LBCL subtypes were identified: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (27 of 32; 84%) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements (5 of 32; 16%). cMYC/BCL2 double-expressor DLBCLs had a poorer DSS than non-double-expressor DLBCLs (5-year DSS, 25% vs 78%) (HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.85; p=0.014). <i>MYD88</i> mutations were present in 10 (29%) of 34 lymphomas and carried a poorer PFS than wild-type cases (5-year PFS, 0% vs 43%) (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98; p=0.039). <i>CD79B</i> mutations were present in 3 (9%) of 34 cases. OA-LBCL consists mainly of two subtypes: DLBCL and HGBL with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements. <i>MYD88</i> mutations are important drivers of OA-LBCL. <i>MYD88</i> mutations, as well as cMYC/BCL2 double-expressor DLBCL, appear to be associated with a poor prognosis. Implementing <i>MYD88</i> mutational analysis in routine diagnostics may improve OA-LBCL prognostication.	2021	10	28	Br J Ophthalmol	Kirkegaard	Marina Knudsen
34707037	10.3960/jslrt.21025	t(9;14)(p13;q32)/PAX5-IGH translocation as a secondary cytogenetic abnormality in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	A 75-year-old man presented with an ileocecal tumor composed of diffuse proliferation of large cells with immunoblastic morphology. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD20, CD79a, IRF4/MUM1, and BCL2, negative for CD5, CD10, and MYC, and partially positive for BCL6. PAX5 was positive with variable staining intensity among the cell nuclei. The V-D-J sequence of IGH showed the mutated configuration. The G-banding karyotype demonstrated two cytogenetic clones with or without t(9;14)(p13;q32), but the two shared other structural and numerical abnormalities. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using PAX5 and IGH probes confirmed the presence or absence of t(9;14)(p13;q32)/PAX5-IGH in each clone. The breakpoints of t(9;14)(p13;q32) were mapped 2,170 bp upstream of the coding region of PAX5 alternative exon 1B and within the IGHJ6-Eμ enhancer intron of IGH. It is suggested that t(9;14)(p13;q32) in this case was a secondary cytogenetic abnormality and the translocation is not necessarily involved in initial malignant transformation of B-cells but can occur later during the course of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	2022	01	13	J Clin Exp Hematop	Ohno	Hitoshi
34708625	10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.2021.05.003	Mechanism of total glucosides from Chishao (Radix Paeoniae Rubra) on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten / phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / protein kinase B signaling pathway.	To investigate the possible molecular mechanism of total glycosides of Chishao (Radix Paeoniae Rubra) (TG-RPR) on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The proliferation of TG-RPR on HepG2 cells was detected using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis of HepG2 cells was measured by annexin V-FITC/double staining. The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) / phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway was evaluated by Western Blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). TG-RPR can up-regulation the expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as PTEN and BCL2-Associated X (Bax), down-regulation the expression of anti-apoptotic factors including B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), PI3K, and Akt. TG-RPR significantly inhibits the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner and promotes apoptosis. These results demonstrated TG-RPR has significant inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells. These results identify a critical role of TG-RPR in proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 cells via modulating PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. TG-RPR may offer a promise as a potential pharmaceutical therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.	2022	02	23	J Tradit Chin Med	Fan	Bing-Bing
34712389	10.1155/2021/9013280	Effect of Maternal Marginal Zinc Deficiency on Development, Redox Status, and Gene Expression Related to Oxidation and Apoptosis in an Avian Embryo Model.	Maternal severe zinc (Zn) deficiency resulted in growth retardation and high mortality during embryonic development in human. Therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating the effect of maternal marginal Zn deficiency on the development and redox status to avoid severe Zn deficiency using an avian model. A total of 324 laying duck breeders at 214 days old were randomly allotted into 3 dietary Zn levels with 6 replicates of 18 ducks per replicate. The birds were fed experimental diets including 3 dietary supplemental Zn levels of 0 mg/kg (maternal Zn-deficient group, 29.2 mg Zn/kg diet), 60 mg/kg (maternal Zn-adequate group), and 120 mg/kg (maternal Zn-high group) for 6 weeks. Dietary Zn levels had on effect on egg production and fertility (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), whereas dietary Zn deficiency decreased breeder plasma Zn concentration and erythrocytic alkaline phosphatase activity at week 6 and inhibited erythrocytic 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) activity at weeks 2, 4, and 6 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), indicating that marginal Zn-deficient status occurred after Zn depletion. Maternal marginal Zn deficiency increased embryonic mortality and contents of superoxide anion radical, MDA, and PPC and reduced MT content and CuZnSOD activity in duck embryonic livers on E29. The MDA content was positively correlated with embryonic mortality. Maternal marginal Zn deficiency increased <i>BCL2-associated X protein</i> and <i>Caspase-9</i> mRNA expressions as well as decreased <i>B-cell lymphoma-2</i> and <i>MT1</i> mRNA and signal AKT1 and ERK1 protein expressions (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Breeder plasma Zn concentration and erythrocytic 5'-NT activities at week 6 were positively correlated with GSH-Px activity and <i>GPx</i>, <i>MT1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i> mRNA expressions in embryonic livers on E29. In conclusion, erythrocytic 5'-NT activity could be more rapid and reliable to monitor marginal Zn-deficient status. Marginal Zn deficiency impaired hatchability and antioxidant defense system and then induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the embryonic liver, contributing to the greater loss of duck embryonic death.	2022	02	07	Oxid Med Cell Longev	Gao	Wei
34718250	10.1097/WNR.0000000000001739	Neuroprotective effect of paeoniflorin in the mouse model of Parkinson's disease through α-synuclein/protein kinase C δ subtype signaling pathway.	Paeoniflorin, an active component of Radix Paeoniae Alba, has a neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's animal models. However, its mechanism of action remains to be determined. In this study, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of paeoniflorin occurs through the α-synuclein/protein kinase C δ subtype (PKC-δ) signaling pathway. We tested our hypothesis in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We evaluated the effects of paeoniflorin on the expression levels of signal components of the α-synuclein/PKC-δ pathway, cellular apoptosis and motor performance. Our results demonstrated that paeoniflorin restored the motor performance impairment caused by MPTP, inhibited apoptosis, and protected the ultrastructure of neurons. Paeoniflorin treatment also resulted in the dose-dependent upregulation of an antiapoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma-2, at the mRNA and protein levels, similar to the effects of the positive control, selegiline. In contrast, paeoniflorin treatment downregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2-Associated X2, α-synuclein, and PKC-δ at the mRNA and protein levels, as well as the level of the activated form of nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB p65). Thus, our results showed that paeoniflorin exerts its neuroprotective effect by regulating the α-synuclein/PKC-δ signaling pathway to reduce neuronal apoptosis.	2022	03	08	Neuroreport	Guo	Kedong
34722836	10.1016/j.reth.2021.09.005	Xeno-free workflow exhibits comparable efficiency and quality of keratinocytes isolated from human skin biopsies.	Regenerative solutions of the skin represent a hope for burn victims with extensive skin loss and chronic wound patients. The development of xeno-free workflow is crucial for clinical application in compliance with the directives of the European Medicines Agency. This study aimed at evaluating the outcome of the xeno-free isolation workflow of keratinocytes from human skin biopsy. Skin biopsies were obtained from volunteers. The epidermis was digested with TrypLE™ Select, which was deactivated by dilution or with trypsin, deactivated by media with fetal bovine serum. Freshly isolated cells were compared for total cell number, viability, activity of caspase 3, gene expression and the presence of the keratinocyte surface markers cytokeratin 14. The cells were cultured in xeno-free conditions for one week and characterized regarding the number and viability as well as the metalloproteinase secretion. The number of obtained cells was similar in both workflows. The cell viability was less in the TrypLE group, with slight reduction of the cell surface marker cytokeratin 14. Caspase 3 activity was comparable as well as the gene expression of the apoptotic markers BAX, BCL2 and SLUG, as well as the keratinocyte markers cytokeratin 14, stratifin and filaggrin. Upon culture, the number of keratinocytes, their viability and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 10 were equal in both groups. This study reports the possibility of isolating functioning and viable keratinocytes through a xeno-free workflow for clinical application.	2022	04	27	Regen Ther	Lagerwall	Cathrine
34732441	10.21873/anticanres.15384	Clinicopathologic and Prognostic Significance of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Expression in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)-mediated B-cell-receptor signaling drives lymphomagenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We investigated the clinicopathological significance of BTK positivity in DLBCL according to known molecules related to resistance to BTK inhibitors [BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2)/MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC)]. We evaluated BTK expression immunohistochemically in 106 DLBCLs considering their BCL2/MYC status. Considering the whole cohort, BTK was expressed in 65.1%, including 70.4% (50/71) of non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) subtype; BCL2 expression was detected in 60.4%, MYC expression in 15.1%, MYC translocation in 4.2% (4/96) and MYC gain/amplification in 7.6% (8/105). Overall and in the non-GCB cohort, BTK positively correlated with high international prognostic index (both p=0.005) and stage (p=0.006 and p=0.002), and with BCL2 intensity (p=0.005 and p=0.026, respectively); MYC gain/amplification total cohort (p=0.038). Moreover, high risk, defined as co-expression of BTK and either or both BCL2/MYC, independently predicted shorter progression-free survival in patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) (all R-CHOP-treated patients: hazard ratio=2.565, p=0.044; R-CHOP-treated non-GCB subgroup: HR=3.833, p=0.019). BTK expression may be utilized to stratify risk in patients with DLBCL.	2021	11	15	Anticancer Res	Han	Yeon Bi
34732719	10.1038/s41467-021-26400-x	Rare t(X;14)(q28;q32) translocation reveals link between MTCP1 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Rare, recurrent balanced translocations occur in a variety of cancers but are often not functionally interrogated. Balanced translocations with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH; 14q32) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are infrequent but have led to the discovery of pathogenic genes including CCND1, BCL2, and BCL3. Following identification of a t(X;14)(q28;q32) translocation that placed the mature T cell proliferation 1 gene (MTCP1) adjacent to the immunoglobulin locus in a CLL patient, we hypothesized that this gene may have previously unrecognized importance. Indeed, here we report overexpression of human MTCP1 restricted to the B cell compartment in mice produces a clonal CD5<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup> leukemia recapitulating the major characteristics of human CLL and demonstrates favorable response to therapeutic intervention with ibrutinib. We reinforce the importance of genetic interrogation of rare, recurrent balanced translocations to identify cancer driving genes via the story of MTCP1 as a contributor to CLL pathogenesis.	2021	12	07	Nat Commun	Walker	Janek S
34733114	10.1155/2021/2255017	Increased Death of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells after TLR4 Inhibition in Sepsis Is Not via TNF/TNF Receptor-Mediated Apoptotic Pathway.	Apoptosis is one of the causes of immune depression in sepsis. Pyroptosis also occurs in sepsis. The toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been shown to play important roles in apoptosis and pyroptosis. However, it is still unknown whether TLR4 inhibition decreases apoptosis in sepsis. Stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with or without lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were cultured with or without TLR4 inhibition using monoclonal antibodies from 20 patients with sepsis. Caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities were measured. The expression of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and Bcl2-associated X (Bax) was measured. The cell death of PBMCs was detected using a flow cytofluorimeter. After TLR4 inhibition, Bcl2 to Bax ratio elevated both in LPS and HMGB1-stimulated PBMCs. The activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 did not change in LPS or HMGB1-stimulated PBMCs. The cell death of LPS and HMGB1-stimulated CD8 lymphocytes and monocytes increased after TLR4 inhibition. The cell death of CD4 lymphocytes was unchanged. The apoptosis did not decrease, while TLR4 was inhibited. After TLR4 inhibition, there was an unknown mechanism to keep cell death in stimulated PBMCs in patients with sepsis.	2022	02	28	Mediators Inflamm	Chu	Chien-Ming
34733270	10.3389/fimmu.2021.703256	Cytomegalovirus in Haematological Tumours.	The exquisite coupling between herpesvirus and human beings is the result of millions of years of relationship, coexistence, adaptation, and divergence. It is probably based on the ability to generate a latency that keeps viral activity at a very low level, thereby apparently minimising harm to its host. However, this evolutionary success disappears in immunosuppressed patients, especially in haematological patients. The relevance of infection and reactivation in haematological patients has been a matter of interest, although one fundamentally focused on reactivation in the post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patient cohort. Newer transplant modalities have been progressively introduced in clinical settings, with successively more drugs being used to manipulate graft composition and functionality. In addition, new antiviral drugs are available to treat CMV infection. We review the immunological architecture that is key to a favourable outcome in this subset of patients. Less is known about the effects of herpesvirus in terms of mortality or disease progression in patients with other malignant haematological diseases who are treated with immuno-chemotherapy or new molecules, or in patients who receive autologous SCT. The absence of serious consequences in these groups has probably limited the motivation to deepen our knowledge of this aspect. However, the introduction of new therapeutic agents for haematological malignancies has led to a better understanding of how natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes interact, and of the role of CMV infection in the context of recently introduced drugs such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, phosphoinosytol-3-kinase inhibitors, anti-BCL2 drugs, and even CAR-T cells. We analyse the immunological basis and recommendations regarding these scenarios.	2021	12	17	Front Immunol	Alonso-Álvarez	Sara
34736967	10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174612	Selective therapeutic benefit of X-rays and inhibitors of EGFR, PI3K/mTOR, and Bcl-2 in breast, lung, and cervical cancer cells.	Cancer continues to be a growing burden, especially in the resource limited regions of the world, and more effective and affordable therapies are highly desirable. In this study, the effect of X-ray irradiation and four inhibitors, viz. those against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was evaluated in lung, breast, and cervical cancer cell lines, including normal cell lines to determine and compare the potential therapeutic benefit of these treatment modalities. A clonogenic survival assay was used to determine the radiosensitivity and cytotoxicity of inhibitors of EGFR, PI3K/mTOR, and Bcl-2 in the cell lines. From the data, the equivalent dose at which 50% of the cell populations were killed, for cancer and normal cells, was used to determine the relative cellular sensitivity to X-ray irradiation and inhibitor treatment. It was found that breast cancer cell lines were more sensitive to X-ray irradiation, whilst cervical and lung cancer cell lines were more sensitive to EGFR and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that patients with breast cancer possessing similar characteristics to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells may derive therapeutic benefit from X-ray irradiation, whilst EGFR and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor therapy may potentially benefit cancer patients possessing cancers similar to HeLa and A549 cells.	2022	03	02	Eur J Pharmacol	Hamid	Mogammad Baaghith
34758330	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109979	TIAM1-RAC1 promote small-cell lung cancer cell survival through antagonizing Nur77-induced BCL2 conformational change.	Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy, has limited treatment options beyond platinum-based chemotherapy, whereafter acquired resistance is rapid and common. By analyzing expression data from SCLC tumors, patient-derived models, and established cell lines, we show that the expression of TIAM1, an activator of the small GTPase RAC1, is associated with a neuroendocrine gene program. TIAM1 depletion or RAC1 inhibition reduces viability and tumorigenicity of SCLC cells by increasing apoptosis associated with conversion of BCL2 from its pro-survival to pro-apoptotic function via BH3 domain exposure. This conversion is dependent upon cytoplasmic translocation of Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor. TIAM1 interacts with and sequesters Nur77 in SCLC cell nuclei and TIAM1 depletion or RAC1 inhibition promotes Nur77 translocation to the cytoplasm. Mutant TIAM1 with reduced Nur77 binding fails to suppress apoptosis triggered by TIAM1 depletion. In conclusion, TIAM1-RAC1 signaling promotes SCLC cell survival via Nur77 nuclear sequestration.	2022	02	17	Cell Rep	Payapilly	Aishwarya
34782660	10.1038/s41598-021-01693-6	Primary central nervous system lymphomas express immunohistochemical factors of autophagy.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive and rare disease. Autophagy is a catabolic mechanism boosting various tumors, including lymphomas; its inhibition is thus a promising therapeutic target. Its presence has never been studied in PCNSLs. We conducted a retrospective immunohistochemical study of 25 PCNSLs for LC3B, p62, and M6PR, comparing it with clinicopathological characteristics. Fourteen (56%) and eleven (44%) PCNSLs were of low and high LC3B expression, respectively. p62 expression was present in most tumors (n = 21, 84%). M6PR was present in all tumors, with 14 (56%) and 11 (44%) cases being of low and high M6PR expression, respectively. LC3B expression was correlated with the performance status (PS) (p = 0.04). No association was found with other clinical parameters, such as deep structure invasion, multiple lesions, complete response, and recurrence after response. p62 showed a strong positive association with MUM1 expression (p = 0.0005). M6PR expression showed a positive correlation (p = 0.04) with PD-L1 expression. No association was found with p53, Ki67, CD8, BCL2, BCL6, or double MYC/BLC2 co-expressors. No association of LC3B, p62, and M6PR expression with survival was found. Our findings provide evidence for the possible presence of autophagic markers in PCNSLs and, thus, for possible treatment targets.	2022	01	27	Sci Rep	Karpathiou	Georgia
34789674	10.1097/APO.0000000000000447	Potential Protective Role of TRPM7 and Involvement of PKC/ERK Pathway in Blue Light-Induced Apoptosis in Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells in Vitro.	Blue light triggers apoptosis of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and causes retinal damage. The aim of this study was to elucidate the protective role of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) in photodamaged RPE cells. RPE cells were isolated from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and exposed to varying intensities of blue light (500-5000 lux) in vitro. Cell proliferation and metabolic activity were respectively assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze the TRPM7, protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Bcl2-associated x/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels. The cells were transfected with TRPM7 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or transduced with TRPM7-overexpressing lentiviruses and cultured with or without the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Blue light inhibited the proliferation and metabolic activity of RPE cells in an intensity-dependent manner when compared to nonirradiated controls (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to the control, photodamaged RPE cells showed decreased levels of TRPM7, PKC, ERK, and Bax, and an increase in Bcl-2 levels (P &lt; 0.01). Forced expression of TRPM7 partially rescued the proliferative capacity of RPE cells (P &lt; 0.01) and restored the levels of TRPM7, PKC, ERK, and Bax (P &lt; 0.01), whereas TRPM7 knockdown had the opposite effects (P &lt; 0.01). TRPM7 and PEDF synergistically alleviated the damaging effects of blue light. Blue light triggers apoptosis of RPE cells, and its deleterious effects can be partially attenuated by the synergistic action of TRPM7 and PEDF via the PKC/ERK signaling pathway.	2021	12	16	Asia Pac J Ophthalmol (Phila)	Hu	Luping
34791478	10.1093/rpd/ncab163	EVALUATION OF BCL2 AND ITS REGULATORY MIRS, MIR-15-B AND MIR-16 EXPRESSION CHANGES UNDER THE EXPOSURE OF EXTREMELY LOW-FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS ON HUMAN GASTRIC CANCER CELL LINE.	In this research, changes in the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), miR-15-b and miR-16 in human adenocarcinoma gastric cancer cell line (AGS) following the exposure to magnetic flux densities (MFDs) of 0.2 and 2 mT continuously and discontinuously (1.5 h on/1.5 h off) for 18 h were investigated. Changes in the cell viability were evaluated by the MTT assay. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the expression changes of BCL2, miR-15-b and miR-16. The results showed that extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) could significantly reduce the viability of AGS cells in the continuous MFD of 2 mT. The BCL2 expression was significantly decreased following the exposure to continuous MFDs of 0.2 and 2 mT and discontinuous MFD of 2 mT. The expressions of miR-15-b and miR-16 were significantly increased in continuous and discontinuous MFD of 2 mT. According to the results, weak and moderate extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields can change the expressions of BCL2, miR-15-b and miR-16.	2021	12	20	Radiat Prot Dosimetry	Heidari	Sahar
34796352	10.5187/jast.2021.e93	Enhanced supply of methionine regulates protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells under hyperthermia condition.	Recent evidence has shown that methionine (Met) supplementation can improve milk protein synthesis under hyperthermia (which reduces milk production). To explore the mechanism by which milk protein synthesis is affected by Met supplementation under hyperthermia, mammary alveolar (MAC-T) cells were incubated at a hyperthermic temperature of 42°C for 6 h in media with different concentrations of Met. While the control group (CON) contained a normal amino acid concentration profile (60 μg/mL of Met), the three treatment groups were supplemented with Met at concentrations of 10 μg/mL (MET70, 70 μg/mL of Met), 20 μg/mL (MET80, 80 μg/mL of Met), and 30 μg/mL (MET90,90 μg/mL of Met). Our results show that additional Met supplementation increases the mRNA and protein levels of BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma-2, an anti-apoptosis agent), and decreases the mRNA and protein levels of BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein, a pro-apoptosis agent), especially at an additional supplementary concentration of 20 μg/mL (group Met80). Supplementation with higher concentrations of Met decreased the mRNA levels of <i>Caspase</i>-<i>3</i> and <i>Caspase</i>-<i>9</i>, and increased protein levels of heat shock protein (HSP70). The total protein levels of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the mTOR signalling pathway-related proteins, AKT, ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (RPS6KB1), and ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), increased with increasing Met supplementation, and peaked at 80 μg/mL Met (group Met80). In addition, we also found that additional Met supplementation upregulated the gene expression of αS1-casein (<i>CSN1S1</i>), β-casein (<i>CSN2</i>), and the amino acid transporter genes <i>SLC38A2</i>, <i>SLC38A3</i> which are known to be mTOR targets. Additional Met supplementation, however, had no effect on the gene expression of κ-casein (<i>CSN3</i>) and solute carrier family 34 member 2 (<i>SLC34A2</i>). Our results suggest that additional Met supplementation with 20 μg/mL may promote the synthesis of milk proteins in bovine mammary epithelial cells under hyperthermia by inhibiting apoptosis, activating the AKT-mTOR-RPS6KB1 signalling pathway, and regulating the entry of amino acids into these cells.	2021	11	20	J Anim Sci Technol	Zhou	Jia
34799660	10.1038/s41388-021-02117-5	Protein kinase RNA-activated controls mitotic progression and determines paclitaxel chemosensitivity through B-cell lymphoma 2 in ovarian cancer.	Anti-tubulin agents, such as paclitaxel, have been used extensively for treatment of several types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Despite their wide use in cancer treatment, however, patient response is highly variable and drug resistance remains a major clinical issue. Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) plays a critical role in immune response to viral infection. We identified PKR as a phospho-protein in response to anti-tubulin agents and this phosphorylation occurs independent of its own kinase activity. PKR is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) during anti-tubulin treatment and unperturbed mitosis and that PKR regulates mitotic progression in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, inactivation of PKR confers resistance to paclitaxel in ovarian and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. PKR expression levels and activity are decreased in chemotherapeutic recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Mechanistically, our findings suggest that PKR controls paclitaxel chemosensitivity through repressing Bcl2 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl2 with FDA-approved agent venetoclax overcomes paclitaxel resistance in preclinical animal models of ovarian cancer. Our results suggest that PKR is a critical determinant of paclitaxel cytotoxicity and that PKR-Bcl2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of recurrent drug-resistant ovarian tumors.	2022	01	03	Oncogene	Yin	Ling
34806851	10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2021.0193	Prognostic value of <i>BCL2</i> and <i>TP53</i> genetic alterations for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with R-CHOP.	Limited data about the prognostic significance of <i>BCL2</i> mutations and <i>BCL2</i> copy number variations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are available. This study aimed to comprehensively describe <i>BCL2</i> genetic alterations in DLBCL patients, and examine correlation of <i>BCL2</i>, <i>TP53</i> and other genetic alterations with outcomes in patients treated with R-CHOP. Probe capture-based high-resolution sequencing was performed on 191 patients diagnosed with <i>de novo</i> DLBCL. MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 protein expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry. The presence of <i>BCL2</i> alterations significantly correlated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (5-year PFS: 13.7% <i>vs.</i> 40.8%; <i>P</i> = 0.003) and overall survival (OS) (5-year OS: 34.0% <i>vs.</i> 70.9%; <i>P</i> = 0.036). Importantly, patients who harbored <i>BCL2</i> gain/amplifications (<i>BCL2</i><sup>GA/AMP</sup>) also had a remarkably inferior 5-year PFS (11.1% <i>vs.</i> 38.3%; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and OS (22.1% <i>vs.</i> 69.6%; <i>P</i> = 0.009). In contrast, neither <i>BCL2</i> mutations nor <i>BCL2</i> translocations were significantly prognostic for survival. Multivariable analyses showed that the presence of <i>BCL2</i> alterations, especially <i>BCL2</i><sup>GA/AMP</sup>, <i>TP53</i> mutations, and International Prognostic Index (IPI) were significantly associated with inferior PFS and OS. Novel prognostic models for OS were constructed based on 3 risk factors, including <i>BCL2</i> alterations (Model 1) or <i>BCL2</i><sup>GA/AMP</sup> (Model 2), <i>TP53</i> mutations, and IPI, to stratify patients into 4 risk groups with different survival outcomes. This study showed that DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, <i>BCL2</i> alterations, especially <i>BCL2</i><sup>GA/AMP</sup> and <i>TP53</i> mutations were significantly associated with inferior outcomes, which were independent of the IPI. The novel prognostic models we proposed predicted outcomes for DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, but further validation of the prognostic models is still warranted.	2022	08	26	Cancer Biol Med	Qin	Yan
34821362	10.1042/BSR20211885	LncRNA SNHG6 knockdown inhibits cisplatin resistance and progression of gastric cancer through miR-1297/BCL-2 axis.	Cisplatin (DDP) resistance is a huge obstacle to gastric cancer (GC) treatment. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been manifested to exert pivotal functions in GC development. Herein, we aimed to explore the functional impact of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) on DDP resistance and progression of GC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay or Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of SNHG6, microRNA(miR)-1297, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors and B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in DDP-resistant GC cells. Half inhibition concentration (IC50) to DDP, clonogenicity, apoptosis and invasion were examined via CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry and Transwell assay, respectively. Target association between miR-1297 and SNHG6 or BCL-2 was demonstrated via dual-luciferase reporter assay or RIP assay. Xenograft models in nude mice were formed to investigate role of SNHG6 in vivo. We found that SNHG6 and BCL-2 were up-regulated, while miR-1297 expression was declined in GC tissues and DDP-resistant cells. Moreover, depletion of SNHG6 or gain of miR-1297 could repress DDP resistance, proliferation and metastasis of DDP-resistant cells, which was weakened by miR-1297 inhibition or BCL-2 overexpression. Besides, SNHG6 positively regulated BCL-2 expression by sponging miR-1297. Furthermore, SNHG6 knockdown repressed GC tumor growth in vivo. In a word, lncRNA SNHG6 knockdown had inhibitory effects on DDP resistance and progression of GC by sponging miR-1297, highlighting its potential in GC treatment.	2022	01	31	Biosci Rep	Mei	Jiazhan
34829668	10.3390/antiox10111797	Impact of Fennel Essential Oil as an Antibiotic Alternative in Rabbit Diet on Antioxidant Enzymes Levels, Growth Performance, and Meat Quality.	In the current study, fennel essential oil was used as an antibiotic alternative compared to gentamycin for enhancing the expression of apoptosis genes and antioxidant enzymes in weaned rabbits as well as meat quality and growth performance. The gene expression of the cell lymphoma 2 (BAX and BCL2), caspase3 (CASP3), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) were estimated in the liver tissue using qRT-PCR. A total of 45 Moshtohor weaned male rabbits aged four weeks were randomly allocated to control, T1, and T2 treatment groups; each consisted of 15 weaned male rabbits with five replicates. Rabbits in the T1 and T2 groups were orally supplied with 1 mL fennel oil and 1 mL gentamycin, respectively. Weaned rabbits under different treatments showed increased body weight (BW) at 8 and 12 weeks of age and average daily gain (ADG) at 4-8 and 4-12 weeks of age compared to the control group. Compared to the controls, the weaned rabbits supplemented with fennel oil and gentamycin had lower total cholesterol, triglyceride, and MDA. In addition, villus length, mRNA of BAX, BCL2, Casp3, and GPX were increased in the different treatments compared to the control. Furthermore, the meat of these rabbits was less tender, had a lower aerobic plate count (APC), pH, and was brighter and redder in color than the control. Under the conditions of the present study, the supplementation of weaned Moshtohor rabbits with fennel oil as a natural alternative for gentamycin enhanced feed conversion and daily gain through enhancing villus length and mucus thickness. Additionally, fennel essential oil reduces oxidative stress by increasing the antioxidant enzymes.	2021	11	30	Antioxidants (Basel)	Imbabi	Tharwat
34830747	10.3390/cancers13225592	Influence of <i>TP53</i> Mutation on Survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in the CAR T-Cell Era.	Refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with poor outcome. The clinical behavior and genetic landscape of DLBCL is heterogeneous and still not fully understood. <i>TP53</i> mutations in DLBCL have been identified as markers of poor prognosis and are often associated with therapeutic resistance. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is an innovative therapeutic concept and represents a game-changing therapeutic option by supporting the patient's own immune system to kill the tumor cells. We investigated the impact of <i>TP53</i> mutations on the overall survival of refractory/relapsed DLBCL patients treated with comparable numbers of therapy lines. The minimum number of therapy lines was 2 (median 4), including either anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy or conventional salvage therapy. A total of 170 patients with DLBCL and high-grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC, BCL2,</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements (DHL/THL), diagnosed and treated in our hospital between 2000 and 2021, were included. Twenty-nine of them received CAR T-cell therapy. <i>TP53</i> mutations were found in 10/29 (35%) and 31/141 (22%) of patients in the CAR T-cell and conventional groups, respectively. Among the 141 patients not treated with CAR T cells, <i>TP53</i> mutation was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (median 12 months with <i>TP53</i> vs. not reached without <i>TP53</i> mutation, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.005), but in the CAR T cell treated group, this significance could not be shown (median OS 30 vs. 120 months, <i>p</i> = 0.263). The findings from this monocentric retrospective study indicate that <i>TP53</i> mutation status does not seem to affect outcomes in DLBCL patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. Detailed evaluation in large cohorts is warranted.	2021	11	29	Cancers (Basel)	Porpaczy	Edit
34831318	10.3390/cells10113095	Multi-Target Effects of Novel Synthetic Coumarin Derivatives Protecting Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y Cells against Aβ Toxicity.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease presenting with progressive memory and cognitive impairments. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD is attributed to the aggregation of misfolded amyloid β (Aβ), which induces neurotoxicity by reducing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) and increasing oxidative stress, caspase-1, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. Here, we have found the potential of two novel synthetic coumarin derivatives, ZN014 and ZN015, for the inhibition of Aβ and neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell models for AD. In SH-SY5Y cells expressing the GFP-tagged Aβ-folding reporter, both ZN compounds reduced Aβ aggregation, oxidative stress, activities of caspase-1 and AChE, as well as increased neurite outgrowth. By activating TRKB-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT) signaling, these two ZN compounds also upregulated the cAMP-response-element binding protein (CREB) and its downstream BDNF and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Knockdown of TRKB attenuated the neuroprotective effects of ZN014 and ZN015. A parallel artificial membrane permeability assay showed that ZN014 and ZN015 could be characterized as blood-brain barrier permeable. Our results suggest ZN014 and ZN015 as novel therapeutic candidates for AD and demonstrate that ZN014 and ZN015 reduce Aβ neurotoxicity via pleiotropic mechanisms.	2021	12	23	Cells	Huang	Ching-Chia
34837933	10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.11.3723	Investigation the Cytotoxicity of 5-AZA on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cell Line In Vitro and Characterization the Underlying Molecular Mechanisms of Cell Death and Motility.	DNA methylation is a reversible biochemical process determinant of gene expression that is frequently observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This is believed to arise from aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity establishing abnormal levels of DNA methylation in tumor cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), is a clinically used epigenetic drug which induces promoter demethylation and gene re-expression in human cancers. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of on MOLT4 and Jurkat leukemic cell line in vitro and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms of cell death and motility. MOLT4 and Jurkat cells were treated with 5-AZA for 12, 24 and 48 hours. The effect of the 5-AZA treatment on cell viability (MTT assay), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression (real-time PCR) was measured. The results showed that 5-AZA could induce MOLT4 and Jurkat apoptotic cell death in vitro in a time-dependent manner and probably via apoptotic mechanisms. We found that treatment with 5-AZA could increase the expression of epigenetically silenced miRNAs, miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-124-1 in treated cells. In addition, mRNA analyses demonstrated that MOLT4 and jurkat cells, expressed p53 gene more than 10-fold higher compared with untreated cells in three independent experiments while the cells suppressed the expression of a subset of functionally related genes including MYC, BCL2, APEX, SIRT1, SNAIL1 and vimentin to some extent, following 5-AZA treatment. We found that a miRNAs expression level in treated cell lines was closely correlated to the expression of their target genes. Together, these findings suggest that 5-AZA may affect the viability of MOLT4 and jurkat cells, at least in part, by regulating the transcription of genes that are associated with cellular apoptotic response.	2022	02	10	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Mogadasi	Maryam
34839787	10.1080/21655979.2021.2010315	Hsp22 ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.	Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is ubiquitous in septic shock patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Heat shock protein 22 (Hsp22), which belongs to the small HSP family of proteins, is involved in several biological functions. However, the function of Hsp22 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced myocardial injury is not yet established. This study was aimed at investigating the underlying mechanistic aspects of Hsp22 in myocardial injury induced by LPS. In this study, following the random assignment of male C57BL/6 mice into control, LPS-treated, and LPS + Hsp22 treated groups, relevant echocardiograms and staining were performed to scrutinize the cardiac pathology. Plausible mechanisms were proposed based on the findings of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting assay. A protective role of Hsp22 against LPS-induced myocardial injury emerged, as evidenced from decreased levels of creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and enhanced cardiac function. The post-LPS administration-caused spike in inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and NLRP3) was attenuated by the Hsp22 pre-treatment. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) levels were augmented by Hsp22 treatment resulting in lowering of LPS-induced oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In summary, the suppression of LPS-induced myocardial injury by Hsp22 overexpression via targeting of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes paves the way for this protein to be employed in the therapy of SIMD.	2022	02	16	Bioengineered	Yu	Yun
34859100	10.1155/2021/4579850	A Network Pharmacology-Based Study on Irritable Bowel Syndrome Prevention and Treatment Utilizing Shenling Baizhu Powder.	Metabolomics was used to detect the secondary metabolites in SLBZP; the target protein was acquired by target fishing according to the compound's structure. The SymMap database was used to search herbal medicines for the target protein. The target gene of IBS gave rise to the common gene protein which is the potential target of SLBZP in IBS therapy. The interactions between target proteins were analyzed in a STRING database, the protein relationship network was analyzed using Cytoscape software, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of the core target gene group was carried out in a DAVID database in order to construct the ""compound-traditional Chinese medicine/molecule-target-pathway"" network. Molecular docking was used to verify the core protein and its related small molecular compounds. There were 129 types of secondary metabolites in SLBZP. 80 target proteins of these metabolites were potential core targets for IBS treatment including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), arachidonate-5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), recombinant cyclin D1 (CCND1), and catenin-<i>β</i>1 (CTNNB1), among others. Results from these targets indicated that the most enriched pathway was the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and that the most abundant pathway was signal transduction. In the network nodes of the TNF signaling pathway, the Chinese medicines with the highest aggregation were Lablab semen album and Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma (degree = 11). The small molecules with the highest aggregation were oxypeucedanin and 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (degree = 4). Molecular docking results confirmed that daidzein 7-O-glucoside (daidzin) had the highest degree of binding to TNF proteins in the TNF signaling pathway. This study shows that SLBZP can treat IBS by influencing multiple targets and pathways, of which the TNF signaling pathway may be the most significant. This typifies the pharmacological characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine, i.e., multiple targets, numerous pathways, and specific therapeutic effects on diseases. SLBZP can therefore be used as a candidate drug for clinical IBS by intervening in human signal transduction.	2022	01	19	Biomed Res Int	Meng	Meng
34889402	10.1182/hematology.2021000247	Double-hit lymphoma: optimizing therapy.	Aggressive B-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous entity with disparate outcomes based on clinical and pathological characteristics. While most tumors in this category are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the recognition that some cases have high-grade morphology and frequently harbor MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations has led to their separate categorization. These cases are now considered distinct from DLBCL and are named ""high-grade B-cell lymphoma"" (HGBL). Most are characterized by distinct rearrangements, but others have high-grade morphological features without these and are called HGBL-not otherwise specified. Studies have demonstrated that this group of diseases leads to poor outcomes following standard rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone therapy; retrospective and recent single-arm, multicenter studies suggest they should be approached with dose-intense treatment platforms. As yet, this has not been validated in randomized trial settings due to the rarity of these diseases. In the relapsed and refractory setting, novel approaches such as anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells and antibodies against CD19 have demonstrated high efficacy in this subgroup. Recently, genomic studies have made much progress in investigating some of the molecular underpinnings that drive their lymphomagenesis and have paved the way for testing additional novel approaches.	2022	02	18	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Dunleavy	Kieron
34889425	10.1182/hematology.2021000312	Does MRD have a role in the management of iNHL?	Among indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHLs), the analysis of measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) has been extensively applied to follicular lymphoma (FL). Treatment combinations have deeply changed over the years, as well as the techniques to measure MRD, which is currently evaluated only in the setting of clinical trials. Here, we discuss the evidence on the role of molecular monitoring in the management of FL. Mature data support the quantification of molecular tumor burden at diagnosis as a tool to stratify patients in risk categories and of MRD evaluation at the end of treatment to predict progression-free survival and overall survival. Moreover, MRD deserves further studies as a tool to refine the clinical/metabolic response and to modulate treatment intensity/duration. Patients with a higher relapse probability can be identified, but the relevance of continuous molecular follow-up should be clarified by kinetic models of MRD analysis. Being the BCL2/heavy chain immunoglobulin gene hybrid rearrangement detectable in about 50% to 60% of advanced FL and in 30% of positron emission tomography/computed tomography-staged localized FL, technical advancements such as next-generation sequencing/target locus amplification may allow broadening the FL population carrying a molecular marker. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction can better quantify MRD at low levels, and novel sources of DNA, such as cell-free DNA, may represent a noninvasive tool to monitor MRD. Finally, MRD in other iNHLs, such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma, is beginning to be explored.	2022	02	16	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Giudice	Ilaria Del
34900354	10.1155/2021/6843103	Rare Presentation of Hypoglycemia in a Patient with Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma.	Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is a rare type of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and arriving at a final diagnosis for this tumor is a challenge for the healthcare providers. Usually, it involves the lymph nodes and extranodal tissues such as the lungs, skin, and other soft tissues. Its presentation by extending into different organs such as the liver, lungs, bones, spleen, and thyroid is rare. Thus, involvement of other organs is very rare as we found in a 54-year-old male patient, a known case of hypertension and end-stage renal disease who was on hemodialysis, who presented to the emergency department with a history of generalized weakness and weight loss of about 20 kg for two months. The tumor cells are positive for CD45, CD30, CD15, MUMi, and Ki-67 (80%) and negative for CD20, PAX-5, CD79a, CD3, CD5, CD10, BCL6, BCL2, EMA, ALK-1, and CD138. The patient was hypoglycemic and hypercalcemic and was managed accordingly. The patient was evaluated, and the third assessment showed that hypoglycemia was resolved due to dexamethasone. The patient's glucose storage was depleted most likely due to liver involvement plus poor general condition. It was asserted that the patient's hypoglycemia could be related to his underlying malignancy. Also, the patient was advised to start tablet diazoxide 45 mg three times a day (3 mg/kg/day TID) in addition to levothyroxine tablet 50 mcg once a day. Tablet diazoxide was stopped, and nutritional support was recommended. This case reveals a rare systematic ALK-1-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma that involves multiple organs. The main learning point from this report is that these tumors can present atypically even in adults and can be ALK-1 negative, which is contrary to the typical systematic anaplastic large-cell lymphomas that are positive for ALK.	2021	12	15	Case Rep Endocrinol	Aldahash	Raed
34906296		[Naringin inhibits the proliferation and invasion of Eca109 esophageal cancer cells and promotes its apoptosis by blocking JAK/STAT signal pathway].	Objective To investigate the inhibitory effect of naringin (NAR) on proliferation and apoptosis of Eca109 esophageal cancer cells and its mechanism. Methods Eca109 cells were cultured with 0, 15, 30, 45 μmol/L NAR treatment for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The colony forming ability of Eca109 esophageal cancer cells was evaluated by cell colony forming assay, the cell proliferation activity was detected by MTT assay, and the invasion ability of cancer cells was detect by Transwell<sup>TM</sup> assay; Apoptosis was detected by annexin V-FITC/PI double labeling combined with flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of B-cell lymphoma factor 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2 related X protein (BAX), cytochrome C (CytC), caspase-3, caspase-9, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phosphorylated JAK2 (p-JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated AKT(p-AKT). Results NAR inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of Eca109 cells, suppressed the invasion of Eca109 cells and promoted the apoptosis of Eca109 cells; NAR promoted the expression of BAX, CytC, caspase-3, caspase-9, p-STAT3, p-AKT, AKT and p-JAK2 and inhibited the expression of Bcl2. Conclusion NAR can inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and colony formation of Eca109 cells and promote its apoptosis by blocking the activation of JAK/STAT signal pathway.	2021	12	16	Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi	Yang	Feng

Interleukin-7 receptor α (encoded by IL7R) is essential for lymphoid development. Whether acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-related IL7R gain-of-function mutations can trigger leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoid-restricted mutant IL7R, expressed at physiological levels in conditional knock-in mice, establishes a pre-leukemic stage in which B-cell precursors display self-renewal ability, initiating leukemia resembling PAX5 P80R or Ph-like human B-ALL. Full transformation associates with transcriptional upregulation of oncogenes such as Myc or Bcl2, downregulation of tumor suppressors such as Ikzf1 or Arid2, and major IL-7R signaling upregulation (involving JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/mTOR), required for leukemia cell viability. Accordingly, maximal signaling drives full penetrance and early leukemia onset in homozygous IL7R mutant animals. Notably, we identify 2 transcriptional subgroups in mouse and human Ph-like ALL, and show that dactolisib and sphingosine-kinase inhibitors are potential treatment avenues for IL-7R-related cases. Our model, a resource to explore the pathophysiology and therapeutic vulnerabilities of B-ALL, demonstrates that IL7R can initiate this malignancy.	2022	01	10	Nat Commun	Almeida	Afonso R M
34938664	10.3389/fonc.2021.789891	Venetoclax Shows Low Therapeutic Activity in BCL2-Positive Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma: A Phase 2 Study of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi.	Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) have a poor prognosis, with an expected survival of less than 1 year using standard salvage therapies. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of PTCL have led to identifying B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein as a potential therapeutic target. BLC2 inhibitor venetoclax was investigated in a prospective phase II trial in patients with BCL2-positive R/R PTCL after at least one previous standard line of treatment (NCT03552692). Venetoclax given alone at a dosage of 800 mg/day resulted in one complete response (CR) and two stable diseases (SDs) among 17 enrolled patients. The majority of patients (88.2%) interrupted the treatment due to disease progression. No relationship with BCL2 expression was documented. At a median follow-up of 8 months, two patients are currently still on treatment (one CR and one SD). No case of tumor lysis syndrome was registered. Therefore, venetoclax monotherapy shows activity in a minority of patients whose biological characteristics have not yet been identified. www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03552692, EudraCT number 2017-004630-29).	2022	04	29	Front Oncol	Ballotta	Laura
34940336	10.3390/gels7040276	Development, Optimization, and In Vitro Evaluation of Novel Oral Long-Acting Resveratrol Nanocomposite In-Situ Gelling Film in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.	This study aimed to develop and evaluate sustained-release (SR) long-acting oral nanocomposites in-situ gelling films of resveratrol (Rv) to treat colorectal cancer. In these formulations, Rv-Soy protein (Rv-Sp) wet granules were prepared by the kneading method and then encapsulated in the sodium alginate (NA) dry films. The prepared nanocomposite in-situ gels films were characterized using dynamic light scattering, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The optimized formulations were further evaluated based on drug encapsulation efficiency, pH-drug release profile, swelling study, and storage time effects. The optimized formulation was tested for its anticancer activity against colorectal cancer cells using the cytotoxicity assessment, apoptosis testing, cell cycle analysis, gene expression analysis, and protein estimation by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods, respectively. The optimum film showed encapsulation efficiency of 97.87% ± 0.51 and drug release of 14.45% ± 0.043 after 8 h. All physiochemical characterizations confirmed, reasoned, and supported the drug release experiment's findings and the encapsulation assay. The Rv nanocomposite formulation showed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity enhanced apoptotic activity as compared to free Rv (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, Rv nanocomposite formulation caused a significant increase in Bcl-2-associated protein X (<i>Bax</i>) and a decrease in expression of B-cell lymphoma 2, interleukin 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (<i>Bcl2</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-6</i>, and <i>TNF-α</i> respectively) compared to that of free Rv in HCT-116 cells. These results suggest that long-acting Rv nanocomposite gels could be a promising agent for colorectal cancer treatment.	2021	12	26	Gels	Md	Shadab
34945004	10.3390/cancers13246384	Artificial Neural Networks Predicted the Overall Survival and Molecular Subtypes of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Using a Pancancer Immune-Oncology Panel.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most frequent subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We used artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron and radial basis function), machine learning, and conventional bioinformatics to predict the overall survival and molecular subtypes of DLBCL. The series included 106 cases and 730 genes of a pancancer immune-oncology panel (nCounter) as predictors. The multilayer perceptron predicted the outcome with high accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98, and ranked all the genes according to their importance. In a multivariate analysis, <i>ARG1</i>, <i>TNFSF12</i>, <i>REL</i>, and <i>NRP1</i> correlated with favorable survival (hazard risks: 0.3-0.5), and <i>IFNA8</i>, <i>CASP1</i>, and <i>CTSG</i>, with poor survival (hazard risks = 1.0-2.1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment toward poor prognosis. These high-risk genes were also associated with the gene expression of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (<i>CD163</i>), and <i>MYD88</i> expression. The prognostic relevance of this set of 7 genes was also confirmed within the IPI and <i>MYC</i> translocation strata, the EBER-negative cases, the DLBCL not-otherwise specified (NOS) (High-grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i> and/or <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements excluded), and an independent series of 414 cases of DLBCL in Europe and North America (GSE10846). The perceptron analysis also predicted molecular subtypes (based on the Lymph2Cx assay) with high accuracy (AUC = 1). <i>STAT6</i>, <i>TREM2</i>, and <i>REL</i> were associated with the germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype, and <i>CD37</i>, <i>GNLY</i>, <i>CD46</i>, and <i>IL17B</i> were associated with the activated B-cell (ABC)/unspecified subtype. The GSEA had a sinusoidal-like plot with association to both molecular subtypes, and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the correlation of <i>MAPK3</i> with the GCB subtype in another series of 96 cases (notably, MAPK3 also correlated with LMO2, but not with M2-like tumor-associated macrophage markers CD163, CSF1R, TNFAIP8, CASP8, PD-L1, PTX3, and IL-10). Finally, survival and molecular subtypes were successfully modeled using other machine learning techniques including logistic regression, discriminant analysis, SVM, CHAID, C5, C&amp;R trees, KNN algorithm, and Bayesian network. In conclusion, prognoses and molecular subtypes were predicted with high accuracy using neural networks, and relevant genes were highlighted.	2021	12	29	Cancers (Basel)	Carreras	Joaquim
34945817	10.3390/jpm11121345	Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Look at the Approved and Emerging Therapies.	Approximately 40% of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) do not respond or develop relapsed disease after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. A minority of these patients can be cured with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT). Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have transformed the treatment paradigm of relapsed/refractory DLBCL, only 30-40% of patients achieve durable remissions. In addition, many patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL are ineligible to receive treatment with CAR T cells due to comorbidities or logistical limitations. Since 2019, the following four non-CAR T-cell treatments have been approved in relapsed/refractory DLBCL: polatuzumab in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, selinexor, tafasitamab plus lenalidomide, and loncastuximab. In this article, I review the data behind these four approvals and discuss important considerations on their use in clinical practice. I also review emerging therapies that have shown promising early results in relapsed/refractory DLBCL including the bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and epigenetic modifiers.	2021	12	28	J Pers Med	Sawalha	Yazeed
34945856	10.3390/jpm11121384	Prognostic Value of Histone Modifying Enzyme EZH2 in RCHOP-Treated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma.	DLBCL represent a heterogeneous group of aggressive diseases. High grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBCL) were recently individualized from DLBCL as a discrete diagnostic entity due to their worse prognosis. Currently, although most patients are successfully treated with RCHOP regimens, 1/3 will either not respond or ultimately relapse. Alterations in histone modifying enzymes have emerged as the most common alterations in DLBCL, but their role as prognostic biomarkers is controversial. We aimed to ascertain the prognostic value of EZH2 immunoexpression in RCHOP-treated DLBCL and HGBCL. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 125 patients with RCHOP-treated DLBCL or HGBCL. EZH2 expression levels did not differ between diagnostic groups or between DLBCL-NOS molecular groups. We found no associations between EZH2 expression levels and outcome, including in the subgroup analysis (GC versus non-GC). Nonetheless, EZH2/BCL2 co-expression was significantly associated with worse outcome (event free survival and overall survival). Although EZH2 mutations are almost exclusively found in GC-DLBCL, we found similar EZH2 expression levels in both DLBCL-NOS molecular groups, suggesting non-mutational mechanisms of EZH2 deregulation. These findings suggest that the use of EZH2 antagonists might be extended to non-GC DLBCL patients with clinical benefit. EZH2/BCL2 co-expression was associated with a worse outcome.	2021	12	29	J Pers Med	Petronilho	Sara
34956871	10.3389/fonc.2021.746577	Clinical Features and Prognostic Significance of <i>NOTCH1</i> Mutations in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group of large lymphoid B cell malignancy with distinct clinical and genetic features. Recently, <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations were identified in DLBCL cases by Next-generation sequencing (NGS), but the clinical features and prognostic impact were not systematically studied. Here, <i>NOTCH1</i> genes in 161 DLBCL samples were sequenced by NGS. The prognostic value of <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations was assessed in the context of clinical and laboratory factors, such as international prognostic index (IPI), cell-of-origin classification, double expression of BCL2 and c-MYC. The combined data from three Western cohorts were used to validate these results. As a result, <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations were found in 17(10.6%) patients, and three patients had a hotspot mutation of c.7541_7542delCT. The presence of <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations was significantly associated with poor complete response and progression free survival(PFS), which was independent of established clinical and laboratory parameters. In addition, 30 (1.92%) of 1562 patients treated with R-CHOP regimen in those combined Western cohorts had <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations. Meta-analysis of the Western cohorts confirmed that <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations were also associated with poor PFS and OS. In conclusion, DLBCL patients with the <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations have worse PFS and OS, and the <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations can be used as an independent predictor for patients with DLBCL.	2021	12	28	Front Oncol	Li	Zhongqi
34963222	10.3760/cma.j.cn115330-20210125-00036	[The role of RUNX1 in the apoptosis of epithelial cells in nasal polyps].	<b>Objective:</b> To explore the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in nasal polyps (NPs) tissues and the potential role on apoptosis of primary human nasal epithelial cells (pHNECs) in NPs. <b>Methods:</b> The expression level of RUNX1 in NPs tissues was determined by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). In vitro, TNF-α (20 ng/ml) was used to stimulate pHNECs to establish the apoptosis injury model. Hoechst staining was performed to observe pHNECs apoptosis by kit. Subsequently, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and WB were utilized to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), BCL2-associated X (BAX) and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3) to assess the level of apoptosis. The plasmid of sh-RUNX1-6 was transfected into the pHNECs apoptosis model, then the effect of RUNX1 silence on apoptosis was evaluated by WB and flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS 19.0 and GraphPad Prism5 software. <b>Results:</b> The expression of RUNX1 in NPs tissue was significantly higher than that in inferior turbinates, and the difference was statistically significant (0.274±0.042 <i>vs</i> 0.110±0.027, <i>t</i>=9.675, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Compared with the inferior turbinates, BAX and Caspase-3 expressions were increased whereas BCL-2 was decreased in NPs, and the differences were statistically significant (BAX 0.346±0.032 <i>vs</i> 0.302±0.037, Caspase-3 0.228±0.061 <i>vs</i> 0.158±0.065, BCL-2 0.090±0.047 <i>vs</i> 0.276±0.057, <i>t</i> value was 2.680, 2.361 and 7.575, respectively, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The expression levels of RUNX1 and apoptosis in pHNECs increased in a time-dependent manner after TNF-α exposure (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Plasmid of sh-RUNX1-6 transfected silenced the expression of RUNX1 in pHNECs treated by TNF-α. After silencing RUNX1 in pHNECs apoptosis model, the protein levels of BAX and Caspase-3 were decreased, while the expression of BCL-2 was increased, the rate of apoptosis was decreased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> RUNX1 is increased in NPs. Silencing RUNX1 can inhibit the apoptosis and reduce cell inflammatory damage of pHNECs induced by TNF-α. <b>目的：</b> 探究Runt相关转录因子1（Runt-related transcription factor 1，RUNX1）在鼻息肉（nasal polyps，NPs）组织中的表达差异，并分析RUNX1在NPs原代人鼻黏膜上皮细胞（primary human nasal epithelial cells，pHNECs）凋亡中的作用及调控机制。 <b>方法：</b> 以免疫蛋白印迹（WB）和免疫组织化学染色检测组织层面RUNX1的表达水平。采用肿瘤坏死因子α（TNF-α，20 ng/ml）体外诱导pHNECs发生凋亡，进行Hoechst染核观察细胞凋亡。随后，通过实时荧光定量反转录聚合酶链反应（qRT-PCR）和WB检测凋亡相关蛋白B淋巴细胞瘤基因2（B-cell lymphoma-2，BCL-2）；BCL2相关蛋白质X（BCL2-associated X，BAX）；含半胱氨酸的天冬氨酸蛋白水解酶3（cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3，Caspase-3）的表达，评估凋亡水平。将sh-RUNX1-6质粒转染至pHNECs凋亡模型，用WB和流式细胞术评估RUNX1沉默对凋亡的影响。通过SPSS 19.0软件和GraphPad Prism 5软件进行统计学分析。 <b>结果：</b> NPs组织中RUNX1的表达明显高于正常下鼻甲组织，差异具有统计学意义（0.274±0.042比0.110±0.027，<i>t</i>=9.675，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。与下鼻甲组织相比，NPs中BAX和Caspase-3高表达，而BCL-2低表达，差异具有统计学意义（BAX 0.346±0.032比0.302±0.037，Caspase-3 0.228±0.061比0.158±0.065，BCL-2 0.090±0.047比0.276±0.057，<i>t</i>值分别为2.680、2.361、7.575，<i>P</i>值均&lt;0.05）。TNF-α诱导后pHNECs中RUNX1的蛋白、mRNA表达和凋亡水平均呈时间依赖性升高，差异具有统计学意义（<i>P</i>值均&lt;0.05）。sh-RUNX1-6质粒转染能够下调TNF-α刺激下pHNECs中RUNX1的表达。沉默TNF-α刺激下pHNECs中的RUNX1后，细胞中BAX和Caspase-3的蛋白水平降低，而BCL-2表达增高，细胞凋亡率降低，差异有统计学意义（<i>P</i>值均&lt;0.05）。 <b>结论：</b> RUNX1在NPs组织中高表达，沉默RUNX1能够抑制TNF-α诱导的pHNECs凋亡，从而减轻细胞炎症损伤。.	2021	12	30	Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi	Pei	Y Y
34970357	10.1155/2021/4933194	MiR-126-HMGB1-HIF-1 Axis Regulates Endothelial Cell Inflammation during Exposure to Hypoxia-Acidosis.	Crosstalk between molecular regulators miR-126, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1-<i>α</i>), and high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) contributes to the regulation of inflammation and angiogenesis in multiple physiological and pathophysiological settings. Here, we present evidence of an overriding role for miR-126 in the regulation of HMGB1 and its downstream proinflammatory effectors in endothelial cells subjected to hypoxia with concurrent acidosis (H/A). <i>Methods</i>. Primary mouse endothelial cells (PMEC) were exposed to hypoxia or H/A to simulate short or chronic low-flow ischemia, respectively. RT-qPCR quantified mRNA transcripts, and proteins were measured by western blot. ROS were quantified by fluorogenic ELISA and luciferase reporter assays employed to confirm an active miR-126 target in the HMGB1 3'UTR. <i>Results</i>. Enhanced expression of miR-126 in PMECs cultured under neutral hypoxia was suppressed under H/A, whereas the HMGB1 expression increased sequentially under both conditions. Enhanced expression of HMGB1 and downstream inflammation markers was blocked by the premiR-126 overexpression and optimized by antagomiR. Compared with neutral hypoxia, H/A suppressed the HIF-1<i>α</i> expression independently of miR-126. The results show that HMGB1 and downstream effectors are optimally induced by H/A relative to neutral hypoxia via crosstalk between hypoxia signaling, miR-126, and HIF-1<i>α</i>, whereas B-cell lymphoma 2(Bcl2), a HIF-1<i>α</i>, and miR-126 regulated gene expressed optimally under neutral hypoxia. <i>Conclusion</i>. Inflammatory responses of ECs to H/A are dynamically regulated by the combined actions of hypoxia, miR-126, and HIF-1<i>α</i> on the master regulator HMGB1. The findings may be relevant to vascular diseases including atherosclerotic occlusion and interiors of plaque where coexisting hypoxia and acidosis promote inflammation as a defining etiology.	2022	04	01	Dis Markers	Liu	Jinxue
34988210	10.21037/atm-21-5975	Andrographolide inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation through the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and by reprogramming host glucose metabolism.	The main aim of this research was to explore the role and mechanism of Andrographolide (Andro) in controlling non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation. Human NSCLC H1975 cells were treated with Andro (0-20 µM) for 4-72 h. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-antagonist/killer (Bak)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) (<i>Bak</i>-siRNA) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1)-siRNA were transfected into H1975 cells to inhibit the endogenic Bak and FBP1 expression, respectively, and their expressions were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB). Cellular proliferation ability was determined through various assessments, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. Cell apoptosis ability was measured using flow cytometry. Pro-apoptotic-related proteins (<i>cleaved caspase 9, cleaved caspase 8</i>, and <i>cleaved caspase 3</i>) and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway proteins [Bcl2-associated X (<i>Bax</i>), <i>Bak, Bcl-2</i>, and cytochrome C (<i>cyto C</i>)] were assessed by WB. Aerobic glycolysis-associated genes [pyruvate kinase M2 (<i>PKM2</i>), lactate dehydrogenase A (<i>LDHA</i>), and glucose transporter 1 (<i>GLUT1</i>)] and gluconeogenesis genes [phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (<i>PEPCK1</i>), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (<i>FBP1</i>), and phosphofructokinase (PFK)] were measured by qRT-PCR. The mitochondrial membrane depolarization sensor, 5, 50, 6, 60-tetrachloro-1, 10, 3, 30 tetraethyl benzimidazolo carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) assay was used for the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Additionally, glycolytic metabolism, lactate production, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis were also analyzed. Andro inhibited human NSCLC cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-time or dose-dependent manner via activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Andro inhibited glycolysis, promoted the gluconeogenesis pathway, and increased the levels of <i>cleaved caspase 9, cleaved caspase 8, cleaved caspase 3, Bax, Bak, PEPCK1, FBP1,</i> and <i>PFK</i>, and decreased the levels of <i>Bcl-2, PKM2, LDHA,</i> and <i>GLUT1</i>. Moreover, it also decreased the ΔΨm and facilitated the release of cyto C from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, Andro enhanced the mitochondrial translocation of <i>Bak</i>, glucose uptake, lactate release, and intracellular ATP synthesis. Suppression of endogenic <i>Bak</i> and <i>FBP1</i> expression significantly reduced the effects of Andro in H1975 cells. Andro represses NSCLC cell proliferation through the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and by reprogramming glucose metabolism.	2022	04	29	Ann Transl Med	Chen	Zhao
35003920	10.7717/peerj.12571	Inhibition of LINK-A lncRNA overcomes ibrutinib resistance in mantle cell lymphoma by regulating Akt/Bcl2 pathway.	Ibrutinib, a bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor which suppresses B-cell receptor signaling, has remarkably improved the outcome of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, approximately 33% of MCL patients have primary Ibrutinib resistance, and acquired Ibrutinib resistance is nearly universal. Long intergenic non-coding RNA for kinase activation (LINK-A) exerts oncogenic role in different types of tumors, but the role of LINK-A in intrinsic ibrutinib resistance in MCL is still unclear. Here, LINK-A expression level was first assessed using quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunofluorescence analysis in five MCL cell lines. The effect of LINK-A on regulating MCL cells viability and apoptosis was assayed using CCK-8 and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. The association of LINK-A with AKT activation and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)expression was evaluated using qPCR and western blot analysis. We found that LINK-A level was elevated in Ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines (Mino, REC-1, MAVER-1, and Granta-519) compared to Ibrutinib-sensitive MCL cell lines (Jeko-1). Functionally, LINK-A overexpression in Jeko-1 cells enhanced cell viability and repressed Ibrutinib-induced cell apoptosis. LINK-A knockdown in MAVER-1 cells decreased cell viability and further accelerated Ibrutinib-induced cell apoptosis. LINK-A overexpression enhanced Bcl2 expression in Jeko-1 cells, and Bcl2 inhibition blocked the effect of LINK-A on increasing cell viability in the presence of Ibrutinib. On the contrary, LINK-A knockdown reduced Bcl2 expression in MAVER-1 cells, and Bcl2 overexpression damaged the role of LINK-A inhibition in regulating cell viability. Mechanistically, LINK-A positively regulated the activation of AKT signaling, and inhibition of AKT signaling destroyed LINK-A-induced increased of Bcl2 and resulted in a subsequent suppression of cell viability. Taken together, the current results demonstrate that LINK-A inhibition overcomes Ibrutinib resistance in MCL cells by regulating AKT/Bcl2 pathway.	2022	01	11	PeerJ	Zhang	Ye
35004320	10.3389/fonc.2021.795330	Case Report: Phenotypic Switch in High-Grade B-Cell Lymphoma With <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL6</i> Rearrangements: A Potential Mechanism of Therapeutic Resistance in Lymphoma?	Lineage switch between myeloid and lymphoid in acute leukemia is well established as a mechanism for leukemic cells to escape chemotherapy. Cross-lineage transformation is also recognized in some solid tumors on targeted therapy, such as adenocarcinomas of the lung and prostate that transforms to neuroendocrine carcinoma on targeted therapy. Now lineage plasticity is increasingly recognized in mature lymphomas, such as small B-cell lymphomas transforming to histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma. However, there is no report of aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma switching from one histologic category to another upon targeted therapy. We report here a case of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements relapsing as a high-grade plasmablastic neoplasm with <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL6</i> rearrangements after R-CHOP and R-EPOCH therapy. Being aware of this rare scenario will help improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and progression of lymphoma.	2022	01	11	Front Oncol	Liu	Hui
35077634		Burkitt Lymphoma With Aberrant Immunophenotype Imposing Diagnostic Challenge.	Burkitt lymphoma (BL) exhibits a characteristic immunophenotype that is positive for pan-B-cell antigens and germinal center markers while negative for immature markers. A deviation from classic immunophenotype can cause diagnostic confusion and might result in false exclusion of BL. In some cases, overlapping clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features of BL and B lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LL) can be of diagnostic challenge. However, definitive delineation is of paramount importance due to difference in treatment. We describe a case of BL in a child with atypical features including absence of L3 morphology in diagnostic tissue and aberrant expression of CD34, CD99 and BCL2 on immunohistochemistry. These findings led to the interpretation of B-LL which was later on excluded by detection of t (8;14). This unorthodox case not only highlights the importance of cytogenetic testing but also emphasizes the correlation of all the diagnostic tools before making a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, reporting this case will help in eliciting the high index of suspicion among pathologists for this exceptionally unusual immunophenotype.	2022	01	27	J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad	Mansoor	Neelum
35116484	10.21037/tcr-20-2748	""Double hit"" B-lymphoblastic lymphoma with concurrent <i>IGH</i>/<i>BCL2</i> and 8q24/<i>MYC</i> translocations: a case report.	B-lymphoblastic lymphomas (B-LBLs) with a documented ""double-hit"" (DH) (<i>IGH/BCL2</i> and 8q24/<i>MYC</i> rearrangement) are rare, and their clinical, cytogenetic and immunophenotypic features have not been well elucidated. Here we describe an unusual case of <i>de novo</i> DH B-LBL. A 39-year-old man presented with abdominal distention at admission. Radiological findings revealed a retroperitoneal lump and multiple lymphadenopathy. Histologic examination of the abdominal mass showed a predominant population of neoplastic lymphoblasts with round nuclei, which focally formed single files surrounded by fibrotic septa. These cells have high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, fine chromatin, and no inconspicuous nucleoli. Necrosis, apoptotic bodies and mitotic figures were common. Prominent starry-sky appearance was not observed. The typical immunophenotype of malignant cells was positive for TdT, CD99, CD10, PAX-5, BCL2 (70%), MYC (70%), and negative for CD34, Cyclin-D1, SOX11, CD56, and CD123. The proliferation index was high with Ki-67 of 80%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies demonstrated 8q24/<i>MYC</i> rearrangement and <i>IGH/BCL2</i> gene fusion. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed no involvement. Normal chromosome karyotype was observed. Finally, the diagnosis of DH B-LBL was clinically rendered. The patient showed an initial response to six cycles of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy (hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) and was alive at the last follow-up (2020.4.10, six months after the diagnosis). Few guidelines regarding DH B-LBL are available in the literature or in the WHO scheme. The optimal clinical management of such patients has not been fully established attributed to the small number of reported cases. Multicenter data is warranted to better make clinical strategies on patients with DH B-LBL.	2022	02	05	Transl Cancer Res	He	Lu
35116524	10.21037/tcr-20-3018	Procyanidins mediates antineoplastic effects against non-small cell lung cancer via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.	Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with one of the highest rates of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for 85% of all lung cancers and have a poor prognosis. Proanthocyanidins (PCs) are polyphenolic compounds that are found widely in natural plants. The present study aimed to determine the effects of PC on lung cancer and identify its possible mechanism. A cell growth assay was used to detect the cell growth ability of A549 cancer cells, and a clonal formation assay was used to detect the cloning ability of A549 cancer cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of PCs on apoptosis and the cell cycle. The wound healing test, Transwell migration, and invasion test were used to detect the migration and invasion of human NSCLC A549 cells. Western blotting was utilized to detect the expression levels of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, vimentin, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), STAT3, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and the apoptosis-related proteins, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and BCL2-associated X (Bax). Cell immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression levels of the p-STAT3 primary antibody. PCs reduced the proliferation and cloning ability of A549 cells and significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the same time, PCs induced apoptosis in A549 cells and G2/M cell cycle arrest. PCs increased the pro-apoptotic protein expression, Bax, and down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein expression, Bcl-2. PCs also inhibited the epithelial-mesothermal transition (EMT) process of A549 cells. We also found that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor, AG490, cooperated with PCs to inhibit A549 cell invasion and migration. Our results demonstrated that PCs could mediate the antitumor effect of NSCLC via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. PCs can inhibit NSCLC A549 cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, clone formation, EMT, and induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. They work by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. As a novel antitumor drug, PCs have broad application prospects for the treatment of NSCLC.	2022	05	01	Transl Cancer Res	Wu	Yue
35124663		An uncommon clinical presentation of primary pancreatic lymphoma: Bleeding. Case report and literature review.	Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) represents less than 0.5% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Clinical manifestations are non-specific and diagnosis is delayed in the majority of patients. 85-year-old woman reporting accidental fall at home 20-days earlier, was admitted with diagnosed of acute abdomen from suspected two-stage rupture of the spleen. The patient complained of pain in the upper abdomen. Blood-chemical tests did not show anemia and leukocytosis, but showed increased CA19.9, CA125, LDH and beta2- microglobulin. Contrast-enhanced CT showed left pleural, perisplenic, perihepatic, and Douglas blood effusion, a neoformation of the body-tail of the pancreas with peri-pancreatic blood layer, splenomegaly due to the presence of a hypodense area as from intraparenchymal hematoma, with an apparently undamaged splenic capsule. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, that revealed the presence of modest free serohematic effusion from oozing of the pancreatic neoformation. The local spread of the disease prevented any attempt at surgical resection. Bleeding was checked with the addition of topical hemostats (Tabotamp®) and biopsy sampling of the pancreatic mass was performed. A final histological diagnosis of large cell NHL of centro-follicular origin, double expressor for the CMYC and BCL2 protein, was achieved. The age of the patient, the poor general conditions, the associated pathologies, the locally advanced spread of the disease and the histological aggressiveness, were contraindications to chemo-radiotherapy treatments. The initial misdiagnosis was due to the history of recent trauma, the uncommon clinical presentation, the underestimation of the serum increase in markers and the interpretation of the CT. Acute Abdomen, Hemoperitoneum, Primary Pancreatic Lymphoma. Il linfoma pancreatico primitivo (PPL) rappresenta meno dello 0.5% di tutte le neoplasie pancreatiche. Le manifestazioni cliniche di esordio non sono specifiche e la diagnosi è tardiva nella maggioranza dei pazienti. OSSERVAZIONE PERSONALE: Donna di 85 anni, ricoverata presso l’Ospedale Universitario “A. Fiorini” di Terracina- Polo Pontino, con diagnosi di addome acuto da sospetta rottura in due tempi della milza. Al ricovero la pz lamentava dolore a carico dei quadranti addominali superiori e riferiva caduta accidentale in casa avvenuta 20 giorni prima. Presentava esami ematochimici negativi per anemia e leucocitosi (Hb12.7g/dl; GB9.8x10/UL), significativo incremento del CA19.9 (196 U/ml), del CA125 (138 U/ml), delle LDH (1044 U/L) e della beta2-microglobulina. La CT torace-addome-pelvi con mdc mostrava versamento a densità ematica in sede pleurica sinistra, perisplenica, periepatica e nel Douglas e una neoformazione del corpo-coda pancreas con falda ematica peripancreatica. La milza appariva di dimensioni notevolmente aumentate, con presenza di area ipodensa di 12.5x10.6 cm di diametro come da ematoma intraparenchimale, con capsula splenica apparentemente indenne. La pz veniva sottoposta a laparotomia esplorativa urgente per sospetto emoperitoneo. All’apertura della cavità peritoneale si dimostrava la presenza di modesto versamento libero sieroematico da stillicidio della neoformazione pancreatica. La diffusione locale della malattia impediva ogni tentativo di resezione chirurgica. Si procedeva a controllo del sanguinamento con apposizione di emostatici topici (Tabotamp®) e a prelievo bioptico dalla neoformazione pancreatica. Si poneva diagnosi istologica finale di Linfoma Non-Hodgkin a grandi cellule di origine centro- follicolare, doppio espressore per la proteina CMYC e BCL2 all’immunoistochimica. L’età della pz, le scadenti condizioni generali, le patologie associate in trattamento poli-farmacologico, la diffusione localmente avanzata della malattia e l’aggressività istologica controindicavano il trattamento chemioradioterapico. CONCLUSIONE: La diagnosi di PPL è molto difficile e tardiva nella maggioranza dei pz, poichè le manifestazioni cliniche di esordio sono di solito aspecifiche; così come nel caso da noi riportato in cui il sanguinamento intraretro- peritoneale era difficilmente riconducibile ad una malattia pancreatica. I riferito trauma addominale, la sintomatologia clinica aspecifica, la CT in cui non erano state evidenziate le alterazioni caratteristiche dei linfomi extranodali, la sottovalutazione dell’aumento dei livelli plasmatici dei marcatori CA19-9 e CA125, delle LDH e della beta2- microglobulina, sono state nel nostro caso la causa di errata diagnosi e indicazione al trattamento chirurgico in urgenza.	2022	02	08	Ann Ital Chir	Spaziani	Erasmo
35127485	10.3389/fonc.2021.780191	Neutralizing Anti-IL-17A Antibody Demonstrates Preclinical Activity Enhanced by Vinblastine in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis.	Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm characterised by the accumulation into granulomas of apoptosis-resistant pathological dendritic cells (LCH-DCs). LCH outcome ranges from self-resolving to fatal. Having previously shown that, (<i>i</i>) monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) from LCH patients differentiate into abnormal and pro-inflammatory IL-17A-producing DCs, and (<i>ii</i>) recombinant IL-17A induces survival and chemoresistance of healthy Mo-DCs, we investigated the link between IL-17A and resistance to apoptosis of LCH-DCs. In LCH granulomas, we uncovered the strong expression of BCL2A1 (alias BFL1), an anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member. <i>In vitro</i>, intracellular IL-17A expression was correlated with BCL2A1 expression and survival of Mo-DCs from LCH patients. Based on the chemotherapeutic drugs routinely used as first or second line LCH therapy, we treated these cells with vinblastine, or cytarabine and cladribine. Our preclinical results indicate that high doses of these drugs decreased the expression of Mcl-1, the main anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member for myeloid cells, and killed Mo-DCs from LCH patients <i>ex vivo</i>, without affecting BCL2A1 expression. Conversely, neutralizing anti-IL-17A antibodies decreased BCL2A1 expression, the downregulation of which lowered the survival rate of Mo-DCs from LCH patients. Interestingly, the <i>in vitro</i> combination of low-dose vinblastine with neutralizing anti-IL-17A antibodies killed Mo-DCs from LCH patients. In conclusion, we show that BCL2A1 expression induced by IL-17A links the inflammatory environment to the unusual pro-survival gene activation in LCH-DCs. Finally, these preclinical data support that targeting both Mcl-1 and BCL2A1 with low-dose vinblastine and anti-IL-17A biotherapy may represent a synergistic combination for managing recurrent or severe forms of LCH.	2022	02	08	Front Oncol	Åkefeldt	Selma Olsson
35155650	10.3389/fvets.2021.817183	The Protective Impact of <i>Salsola imbricata</i> Leaf Extract From Taif Against Acrylamide-Induced Hepatic Inflammation and Oxidative Damage: The Role of Antioxidants, Cytokines, and Apoptosis-Associated Genes.	<i>Salsola imbricata</i> is a herbal plant native to Saudi Arabia, known for its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. This study explored the protective effects of an ethanolic leaf extract of <i>Salsola imbricata</i> against the oxidative stress and hepatic injury caused by acrylamide. Rats received intragastric administrations of 20 mg/kg of body weight of acrylamide to induce hepatic injury, or 300 mg/kg of body weight of <i>Salsola</i> ethanolic extract orally for 7 days before acrylamide administration. The treatments were continued for 3 weeks. Blood and liver samples were collected from all the groups, and the following biochemical parameters were tested: serum ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), GGT (gamma glutaryl transferase), urea, albumin, total proteins, catalase, SOD (superoxide dismutase), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO), and MDA (malondialdehyde). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of Nrf2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2), HO-1 (Hemoxygenase-1), COX-2 (Cyclooxgenase-2), TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-beta1), Bax, and Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), which are associated with oxidative stress, fibrosis, apoptosis, and anti-apoptotic effects. The annexin and survivin immunoreactivity were examined at the immunohistochemical level. Pretreatment with the <i>Salsola</i> ethanolic extract reduced the negative impact of acrylamide on ALT, AST, GGT, urea, albumin, and total proteins. The <i>Salsola</i> ethanolic extract reversed acrylamide's effects on serum and tissue antioxidants. Nrf2/HO-1 expression was downregulated, while COX-2 and TGF-β1 were upregulated in the acrylamide-administered group and normalized by the pre-administration of <i>Salsola</i> ethanolic extract to the acrylamide experimental group. The immunoreactivity of annexin and survivin was restored in the experimental group administered <i>Salsola</i> ethanolic extract plus acrylamide. In conclusion, <i>Salsola</i> ethanolic extract inhibits and regulates the side effects induced in the liver by acrylamide. <i>Salsola</i> induced its impacts by regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis-/anti-apoptosis-associated genes at the biochemical, molecular, and cellular levels. <i>Salsola</i> is recommended as oxidative stress relievers against environmental toixicity at high altitude areas.	2022	02	15	Front Vet Sci	Soliman	Mohamed Mohamed
35546979	10.22092/ari.2021.356202.1803	Renoprotective Potential of the Ultra-Pure Lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter Sphaeroides on Acutely Injured Kidneys in an Animal Model.	One of the main causes of acute kidney injury is ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI). Inflammatory response, apoptotic damages, and oxidative stress-related injuries are all involved in the pathogenesis of IRI. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are strongly associated with IRIs, especially TLR4, which is markedly induced in response to IRI. Accordingly, the current study aimed to investigate the potential renoprotective effect of ultrapure lipopolysaccharide from <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> (ULPS-RS) at two doses in an animal model of bilateral IRI. A total of 30 adult male rats were divided randomly into five equal groups of control (laparotomy plus bilateral renal IRI), vehicle (same as the control group, but pretreated with the vehicle), sham (laparotomy only), ULPS-RS (same as the control group, but pretreated with 0.1 mg/kg of ULPS-RS), and ULPS-RSH (same as the control group, but pretreated with 0.2 mg/kg of ULPS-RS). Subsequent to 30 min of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion, serum samples were collected for measuring urea, creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. Afterward, tissue samples were obtained from all animals to measure inflammatory mediators (interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α), oxidative stress marker (8-isoprostane), apoptosis mediators (B cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl2]), and Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax). In the control group, all of the measured parameters were significantly elevated in response to IRI, except for Bcl2, which decreased significantly. On the other hand, exactly opposite effects were observed in the ULPS-RS treated groups indicating the nephroprotective effect of this compound against IRI at both tested doses. The findings reveal for the first time that ULPS-RS has the therapeutic potential of attenuating the renal dysfunction induced by IRI.	2022	05	17	Arch Razi Inst	Aal-Aaboda	M S
31838216	10.1016/j.ijid.2019.12.004	Do genetic polymorphisms of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 confer susceptibility to anti-tuberculous therapy-associated drug-induced liver injury?	The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) polymorphisms and susceptibility to anti-tuberculous therapy-associated drug-induced liver injury (ATT-DILI). A total of 746 tuberculosis (TB) patients were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in BCL2 were analyzed by custom-by-design 2×48-Plex SNPscan kit. The allele and genotype frequencies between patients with and without ATT-DILI were compared using three different genetic models. A total of 727/746 participants were successfully genotyped, and 112 of them were diagnosed with ATT-DILI. The A allele of rs8085707, G allele of rs76986960, and A allele of rs949037 conferred an increased risk of ATT-DILI, with estimated odd ratios (ORs) of 2.181 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.345-3.536, p=0.001), 1.983 (95% CI 1.060-3.709, p=0.029), and 1.390 (95% CI 1.032-1.873, p=0.03), respectively. Bonferroni correction indicated that the A allele of rs8085707 was a risk factor for ATT-DILI (Bonferroni correction: p=0.026). The additive model suggested that patients with the AA genotype of rs8085707 had a significantly higher risk of ATT-DILI compared with those with the GG genotype (Bonferroni correction: p=0.036). The influence of BCL2 polymorphisms on clinical characteristics (clinical symptoms, disease subtypes, and laboratory indicators) was also identified. This study is novel in suggesting an association between BCL2 polymorphisms and the risk of ATT-DILI.	2020	03	23	Int J Infect Dis	Lyu	Mengyuan
31844144	10.1038/s41375-019-0691-6	Distinct genetic changes reveal evolutionary history and heterogeneous molecular grade of DLBCL with MYC/BCL2 double-hit.	Using a Burkitt lymphoma-like gene expression signature, we recently defined a high-risk molecular high-grade (MHG) group mainly within germinal centre B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (GCB-DLBCL), which was enriched for MYC/BCL2 double-hit (MYC/BCL2-DH). The genetic basis underlying MHG-DLBCL and their aggressive clinical behaviour remain unknown. We investigated 697 cases of DLBCL, particularly those with MYC/BCL2-DH (n = 62) by targeted sequencing and gene expression profiling. We showed that DLBCL with MYC/BCL2-DH, and those with BCL2 translocation, harbour the characteristic mutation signatures that are associated with follicular lymphoma and its high-grade transformation. We identified frequent MYC hotspot mutations that affect the phosphorylation site (T58) and its adjacent amino acids, which are important for MYC protein degradation. These MYC mutations were seen in a subset of cases with MYC translocation, but predominantly in those of MHG. The mutations were more frequent in double-hit lymphomas with IG as the MYC translocation partner, and were associated with higher MYC protein expression and poor patient survival. DLBCL with MYC/BCL2-DH and those with BCL2 translocation alone are most likely derived from follicular lymphoma or its precursor lesion, and acquisition of MYC pathogenic mutations may augment MYC function, resulting in aggressive clinical behaviour.	2020	09	29	Leukemia	Cucco	Francesco
31880257	10.2174/1389203721666191227122252	Role of BCL-2 Family Proteins in Apoptosis and its Regulation by Nutrients.	In the body, millions of cells die and proliferate each day to maintain normal function and cooperation of all tissues, organs, and systems. Thus, programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is critical to sustain growth, development, and body health. The vital role of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins in apoptosis has been identified. The BCL-2 family includes both pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, which are structurally and functionally related, containing up to four BCL-2 homology (BH) motifs (BH1-4). There are also some nutritional factors that regulate apoptosis via the BCL-2 family proteins. In this review, the BCL-2 family proteins and their apoptosis-inducing mechanism have been discussed, along with the nutrient factors that regulate apoptosis through the BCL-2 family proteins.	2021	05	26	Curr Protein Pept Sci	Zheng	Chen
31889428	10.1002/kjm2.12181	miR-636 represses cell survival by targeting CDK6/Bcl-2 in cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is widely known as one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in women, and microRNAs (miRNAs) has been characterized as an important regulator in tumor progression, such as cervical cancer. MiR-636 was found to play a tumor suppressor role in hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis. However, the tumorigenic mechanism of miR-636 on cervical cancer has not yet been found. In the present study, we first found that miR-636 was significantly downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. in vitro gain- and loss-of-function assays revealed that overexpression of miR-636 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, while knockdown of miR-636 reversed the effect on cervical tumorigenesis. Furthermore, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were characterized as targets of miR-636. Notably, overexpression of CDK6 or Bcl-2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-636 on cervical cancer progression. Mechanistically, miR-636 repressed cell survival by targeting CDK6/Bcl-2 in cervical cancer, which may be the underlying mechanism of miR-636-inhibited cervical progression. In conclusion, our findings clarified the biologic significance of miR-636/CDK6/Bcl-2 axis in cervical cancer progression and suggested the potential therapeutic target ability of miR-636 in treatment of cervical cancer.	2021	07	29	Kaohsiung J Med Sci	Hu	Qing-Lan
31954371	10.1016/j.redox.2019.101403	Superoxide induced inhibition of death receptor signaling is mediated via induced expression of apoptosis inhibitory protein cFLIP.	The death inhibitory proteins, cFLIP and Bcl-2, canonically act at different steps to regulate receptor-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Here we report that pharmacological or genetic means to effect an increase in intracellular superoxide result in cFLIP upregulation. Interestingly, Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with a concomitant increase in cFLIP, and reducing superoxide sensitizes Bcl-2 overexpressing cancer cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis via downregulation of cFLIP. Moreover, inhibiting glycolytic flux overcomes apoptosis resistance by superoxide-dependent downregulation of cFLIP. Superoxide-induced upregulation of cFLIP is a function of enhanced transcription, as evidenced by increases in cFLIP promoter activity and mRNA abundance. The positive effect of superoxide on cFLIP is mediated through its reaction with nitric oxide to generate peroxynitrite. Corroborating these findings in cell lines, subjecting primary cells derived from lymphoma patients to glucose deprivation ex vivo, as a means to decrease superoxide, not only reduced cFLIP expression but also significantly enhanced death receptor sensitivity. Based on this novel mechanistic insight into the redox regulation of cancer cell fate, modulation of intracellular superoxide could have potential therapeutic implications in cancers in which these two death inhibitory proteins present a therapeutic challenge.	2021	04	16	Redox Biol	Hirpara	Jayshree L
32100014	10.1093/jnen/nlaa006	Anti-HMGCR Antibody-Positive Myopathy Shows Bcl-2-Positive Inflammation and Lymphocytic Accumulations.	Anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and antisignal recognition particle (SRP) antibodies are frequently associated with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). However, the difference in clinical manifestations between anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies is unclear. HMGCR is an essential enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis and is inhibited by statins that regulate apoptosis of Bcl-2-positive and beta chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)-positive lymphoma cells. In this study, we aimed to clarify Bcl-2 and CCR4 expressions of lymphocytes in anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM and explore the difference between anti-HMGCR antibody-positive myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies. We retrospectively examined Bcl-2- and CCR4-positive lymphocyte infiltrations in muscle and skin biopsy specimens from 19 anti-HMGCR antibody-positive patients and 75 other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) patients. A higher incidence of Bcl-2- and CCR4-positive lymphocytes was detected in the muscle and skin of anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM patients (p &lt; 0.001). In 5 patients with anti-HMGCR antibodies, Bcl-2-positive lymphocytes formed lymphocytic accumulations, which were not observed in other IIMs. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were not increased except for patients with Bcl-2-positive lymphocytic accumulations (p = 0.010). Bcl-2 and CCR4 lymphocyte infiltrations could be a pathological characteristic of anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM.	2020	11	20	J Neuropathol Exp Neurol	Kurashige	Takashi
32101329	10.1002/hon.2727	Immunohistochemistry for c-myc and bcl-2 overexpression improves risk stratification in primary central nervous system lymphoma.	Overexpression of bcl-2 and c-myc are defining features of double-expressor-lymphoma (DEL) but may also occur separately in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Despite all progress in optimizing treatment regimen, there is lack of sufficient risk stratification models. Here, we first describe the relationship between DEL biology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (NCCN-IPI), treatment response, disease progression, and mortality in PCNSL. In this study, we determined c-myc and bcl-2 status immunohistochemically in samples of 48 patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL and followed these patients for a median interval of 6.2 years. Twelve, 18, and 17 patients harbored none, one, or both DEL features. Corresponding overall response rates after first-line therapy were strongly associated with DEL biology (100%, 42%, and 44% in patients with 0, 1, or 2 DEL features). Patients with one or both DEL features had a 5-fold and 13-fold higher 5-year risk of progression and/or death than patients without DEL features. These associations prevailed after adjusting for the NCCN-IPI. DEL improved the discriminatory capability of the NCCN-IPI (P = .0001). Furthermore, we could show that addition of DEL biology to the NCCN-IPI significantly improved the score's discriminatory potential both toward progression-free survival (increase in Harell's c = 0.15, P = .005) and overall survival (increase in Harell's c = 0.11, P = .029). In conclusion, DEL biology is a strong and simple-to-use predictor of adverse outcome in PCNSL. Addition of DEL to the NCCN-IPI improves its prognostic potential. Disease progression from PCNSL harboring both DEL features is invariably fatal. This defines a novel PCNSL patient subset with a great unmet need for improved therapy.	2020	08	31	Hematol Oncol	Hatzl	Stefan
32334477	10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.4.1103	The Frequency of Double Expresser in Selected Cases of High Grade Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are fast-growing non-Hodgkin lymphomas that affect B-lymphocytes. Double expressor DLBCL is the concomitant expression of Myc and Bcl-2 proteins during lymphomas which results in poor prognosis of patients. This study aimed to determine the frequency of double expresser in high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The study was conducted on 74 cases (54 males (68.4%) and 20 females (25.3%)) of DLBCL between August 2018 to January 2019. The mean age of the 74 patients was 51.7 years + 18.5. Expression of proteins c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The involvement of primary lymph node was reported in 38 cases (51.3%) whereas, extra nodal site was observed in 22 cases (29.7%). Among the primary sites, the cervical lymph node enlargement was the most frequent site of presentation. The rearrangement pattern was studied among 74 patients, 35 (47%) were found to have either one of the rearrangements i.e. Myc, Bcl-2, or Bcl-6. On the other hand, 14 (18.9%) had shown double rearrangements i.e. Bcl-2 and c-Myc (11 cases) and Bcl-6 and c-Myc (3 cases). The Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 rearrangements were demonstrated by 12 cases whereas 2 cases (2.7%) indicated all three types of rearrangements i.e. c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6. In 11 cases the Bcl-2 and c-Myc rearrangements were found to be Bcl-2 &gt; 50% and c-Myc &gt; 40% and demonstrating the overall frequency of double expressers as 14.8%. The prognosis of the mentioned cases was extremely poor, median survival of 10 months. The concurrent expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc was found to be 14% (level of expression for Bcl-2 &gt; 50% and c-Myc &gt; 40%) which is potentially a significant health burden and an emerging threat.	2021	02	02	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Naseem	Maria
32364682	10.1111/ijlh.13222	Significance of CD10 protein expression in the diagnostics of follicular lymphoma: A comparison of conventional immunohistochemistry with flow cytometry supported by the establishment of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements.	Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a crucial role of CD10 expression remain a standard diagnostic tool in follicular lymphoma (FL). The results of IHC CD10 detection with different primary antibodies are not fully reproducible, but some reports show that flow cytometry (FCM) can be a reliable method of CD10 identification. The aim of the study was to compare results of CD10 expression in FL by IHC and FCM including immunophenotypic features in the context of the BCL2 and BCL6 alterations. Out of 76 histopathologically diagnosed FL, a group of 25 cases had simultaneously FCM. Immunohistochemically 77.6% of cases were CD10-positive with comparable and reproducible results to FCM. Differences between the FCM expression of CD5/CD10/CD11c/CD25/CD43 and BCL2 overexpression (BCL2(+)<sup>higher</sup> ) correlated with the BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements (R) status. Lack of CD10 expression corresponded with the absence of BCL2R and higher MUM1 expression by IHC results but had no clinical impact on the long-time outcomes. Immunohistochemistry staining is a comparable method to FCM assessment in the evaluation of CD10 expression and diagnosis of FL. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy/FCM (FNAB/FCM) could be a useful tool for verifying FL diagnosis and CD10 detection. Despite its heterogeneity, FL has a characteristic immunophenotype. BCL2R and BCL6R FL cases differ mainly in levels of BCL2 and CD10 with CD43 co-expression; BCL2(+)<sup>higher</sup> by FCM correlates with BCL2R. Moreover, FNAB plays an important role in material provision for supportive karyotyping and BCL2R, BCL6R assessed by FISH.	2021	01	05	Int J Lab Hematol	Szumera-Ciećkiewicz	Anna
32566654	10.1155/2020/1350820	Prognostic Value of Concurrent Expression of C-MYC and BCL2 in Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A 10-Year Retrospective Study.	Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a variant of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), characterized by the presence of a B-lymphoma cell in the lumina of small blood vessels or capillaries. Due to its extremely variable clinical manifestations, IVLBCL typically results in a delayed diagnosis and poor disease prognosis. Skin biopsy, particularly random skin biopsy, has shown a potential role in the diagnosis of IVLBCL. However, information of clinicopathological features in patients with IVLBCL diagnosed by skin biopsy is limited. To study the clinicopathological features in relation to immunohistochemical features and to identify prognostic factors in IVLBCL patients diagnosed by skin biopsy. Clinical characteristics; laboratory, histological, and immunohistochemical findings; and therapeutic response of all biopsy-confirmed IVLBCL patients during the years 2008-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age was 67.4 (±9.8) years. Fever was the most common presenting symptom, accounting for 64.7%. Cutaneous and bone marrow involvement was found in 23.5% and 35.3% of patients, respectively. Patients receiving R-CHOP showed more favorable therapeutic outcome. C-MYC/BCL2 double expressors showed significantly higher incidence rate to mortality compared with nondouble expressors (<i>p</i> = 0.042). One-year and two-year overall survival rates were 67.2% and 53.8%, respectively. Skin biopsy is an effective diagnostic method for IVLBCL. Concurrent expression of C-MYC and BCL2 may be a useful prognostic indicator and should be performed in order to predict the prognosis in IVLBCL patients.	2021	03	22	Biomed Res Int	Boonsakan	Paisarn
32580907	10.1016/j.clbc.2020.05.005	p53 and BLC2 Immunohistochemical Expression Across Molecular Subtypes in 1099 Early Breast Cancer Patients With Long-Term Follow-up: An Observational Study.	p53 and antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BLC2) have been proposed as prognostic markers for early breast cancer (BC), although their relationship with conventional parameters and patient prognosis, as well as their distribution within the molecular BC subtypes remains uncertain. In this observational study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and BLC2 in 1099 early BC patients surgically treated between 2000 and 2006 and followed for at least 5 years, also considering their association with pathologic factors and molecular subtypes, as well as their influence on disease-free survival. p53 and BLC2 are distributed differently across molecular subtypes (P &lt; .0001); in particular, p53 positivity and BLC2 negativity seems to be associated with more aggressive conventional tumor phenotypes. Moreover, BLC2 negativity seems to be a significant discriminating factor for disease-free survival (P = .003) according to Kaplan-Meier analysis, while p53 seems to have no discriminating effect. Among patients with discordant p53/BLC2 phenotype, the combination p53<sup>+</sup>BLC2<sup>-</sup> seems to be associated with the worst outcomes (P = .007) and significantly influenced the clinical course of node-negative patients treated only with hormone therapy (P = .004). These two biomarkers, in addition to conventional pathologic factors and molecular subtype, could help define the risk and outcome of BC.	2021	10	11	Clin Breast Cancer	Fabi	Alessandra
32632899	10.1007/s12253-020-00866-4	A Clinicopathological Approach to Odontogenic Cysts: the Role of Cytokeratin 17 and bcl2 Immunohistochemistry in Identifying Odontogenic Keratocysts.	Odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs) are developmental cysts of the jaws that require proper diagnosis due to their potential for local aggressive growth and recurrences. OKCs have a typical parakeratotic epithelium demonstrating transepithelial cytokeratin 17 (CK17) and basal bcl2 staining on immunohistochemistry (IHC), which distinguishes them from other common jaw cysts. Secondary to inflammation, the epithelial lining may be altered and loses the typical IHC phenotype. The aim of the present study was to analyse a series of consecutive jaw cysts for their expression of CK17 and bcl2 and assess how these IHC stains may help in their diagnosis. All cysts were retrospectively assessed for available clinical, radiological and pathological findings and diagnoses were revised whenever needed. 85 cysts from 72 patients were collected from two departments. The series had 21 OKCs, the remaining non-OKCs included radicular/residual, dentigerous, paradental, lateral periodontal, botryoid odontogenic cysts. OKCs with typical epithelium showed the typical IHC phenotype, which was generally lost in inflammation-associated altered epithelium. Contrarily to earlier descriptions, a wide variety of CK17 positivity was seen in the majority of non-OKCs, including focal transepithelial staining. Basal bcl2 staining was also seen in 16 non-OKCs. These stainings were never as strong in intensity as seen in OKCs. One case was histopathologically identified as OKC due to focally maintained IHC profile. CK17 and bcl2 IHC may help in the diagnosis of OKCs, but must be interpreted with caution and is not a yes or no tool in the diagnostic puzzle.	2021	07	12	Pathol Oncol Res	Cserni	Dorottya
32648768	10.1139/bcb-2019-0336	MiR-448 targets BLC2 and inhibits the growth of pituitary adenoma cells.	There is an increasing body of evidence indicating the important roles of miRNAs in the progression of pituitary adenoma. Recent studies have shown decreased expression and tumor suppressive function of miR-448 in cancers; however, the clinical significance of miR-448 in pituitary adenoma has remained largely unknown. In our study, we found that miR-448 was down-regulated in pituitary adenoma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-448 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of pituitary adenoma cells. Increased cell apoptosis was also observed with overexpression of miR-448. To further understand the mechanisms behind the regulation of pituitary adenoma by miR-448 in, the targets of miR-448 were predicted using the bioinformatics tools. B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) was identified as a target of miR-448. MiR-448 bound the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of BCL2 and inhibited the expression of BCL2 in pituitary adenoma cells. There was a consistent and significantly negative correlation between the level of miR-448 and BCL2 in pituitary adenoma tissues. When BCL2 was highly expressed, the inhibitory impact of miR-448 on the proliferation and apoptosis of pituitary adenoma cells was significantly inhibited. Collectively, our findings emphasize the significance of the miR-448-BCL2 axis in the development of pituitary adenoma, highlighting the potential therapeutic significance of miR-448 in pituitary adenoma.	2021	05	13	Biochem Cell Biol	He	Chao

32722781	10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001551	Extra copies of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 and outcome in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with translocations involving MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 comprises ∼10% of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and carries a poor prognosis. The incidence, prognosis, and optimal therapy for DLBCL harboring extra copies of the genes MYC, BCL2, and BCL6, rather than their genetic translocations, are unknown. In this retrospective, single-center study we identified 144 DLBCL cases including 46 patients with classic HGBL with double-hit or triple-hit chromosomal translocations (DHL), 55 with extra copies of MYC in addition to aberrations (extra copies or translocations) of BCL2 and/or BCL6 but did not meet the criteria for HGBL (EC group), and 43 without any aberrations of MYC, BCL2, or BCL6 (wild type [WT]). Unfavorable baseline characteristics had similar frequency in the EC and WT groups, but were significantly more prevalent in the DHL group. With a median follow-up of 36 months, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was similar between the WT and EC groups at 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65-90) and 82% (95% CI, 72-93), respectively. In contrast, the 2-year EFS of the DHL group was 63% (95% CI, 51-79). The 2-year overall survival in the WT, EC, and DHL groups was 86% (95% CI, 76-97), 89% (95% CI, 81-98), and 74% (95% CI, 62-88), respectively. Among patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), the EC group had outcomes similar to those of the WT group. Our results indicate that patients with DLBCL with extra gene copies of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 fare differently from those with HGBL and respond well to standard R-CHOP therapy.	2021	05	14	Blood Adv	Sermer	David

Besides <i>BCL2</i> translocation, copy number (CN) gains and translocations of <i>BCL6</i>, <i>MYC</i>, and <i>IRF4</i> have also been detected in FL, but there is little information regarding their prognostic significance. This retrospective study used fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) to analyze <i>BCL2</i>, <i>BCL6</i>, <i>MYC</i>, and <i>IRF4</i> translocations and CN gains in 105 FL cases. Genetic translocations were detected for <i>BCL2</i> (<i>n</i> = 64; 72.7%), <i>BCL6</i> (<i>n</i> = 14; 15.9%), and <i>MYC</i> (<i>n</i> = 2; 2.3%); no case showed <i>IRF4</i> translocation. Overall, 23 (26.1%), 30 (34.1%), 12 (13.8%), and 10 (11.0%) cases showed CN gains in <i>BCL2</i>, <i>BCL6</i>, <i>MYC</i>, and <i>IRF4</i>, respectively. <i>BCL6</i> CN gain was a prognostic factor for worse overall survival, demonstrating a trend toward significance in multivariate analysis (HR =8.769, <i>p</i> = 0.056). <i>BCL6</i> CN gain in FL might be associated with aggressive biologic behavior.	2021	03	11	Leuk Lymphoma	Kim	Meejeong
32991338	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001577	High-grade B-Cell Lymphoma With MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 Translocations/Rearrangements: Clinicopathologic Features of 51 Cases in a Single Institution of South China.	Double-hit/triple-hit lymphomas (DH/THLs) are high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements and/or BCL6 rearrangements, which have poor outcomes after standard chemoimmunotherapy. This retrospective study analyzed 51 patients (range, 19 to 82 y) diagnosed from 2016 to 2019 and treated for DH/THL (n=34 MYC/BCL6 DHL, n=14 MYC/BCL2 DHL, n=3 THL) at one institution in South China. Extranodal lesions occurred in 32 patients (62.7%), more frequently in MYC/BCL6 DHL (22/34, 64.7%) than in MYC/BCL2 DHL (7/14, 50%). The most common extranodal sites were the stomach (8/32, 25.0%) and intestine (5/32, 15.6%). Most patients (33/45, 73.3%) presented with Ann Arbor stage III/IV. Interestingly, 14.3% (4/28) of MYC/BCL6 DHL tumors showed diffuse, medium-intensity CD30 expression. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA was positive in 3 cases, all MYC/BCL6 DHL. Among 48 patients (94.1%) with follow-up data, 18 (37.5%) died owing to the disease, and the median survival was 5.5 months. Germinal center B cells were observed more frequently in MYC/BCL2 DHL (14/14, 100.0%) than in MYC/BCL6 DHL (15/34, 44.1%; P&lt;0.001). Bone marrow involvement tended to lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.033). No association was observed between stage, B symptoms, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and central nervous system involvement and OS. A total of 25 patients (25/47, 53.2%) with previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections had significantly poorer OS (P=0.014). Chronic HBV infection was positively correlated with MYC/BCL6 DHL (r=0.317, P=0.030). Compared with DH/THL in western countries, the disease in South China has distinct characteristics with a higher prevalence of MYC/BCL6 DHL. We speculate that HBV is important in DH/THL tumorigenesis. These findings might provide clues for novel treatment strategies.	2021	01	11	Am J Surg Pathol	Zhang	Jijun
33031695		A Study Investigating the Role of 2 Candidate SNPs in Bax and Bcl-2 Genes in Alzheimer's Disease.	The proto-oncogene Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) and related protein Bcl-2 (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma-2) genes are triggers of apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The balance of these proteins has an important role in the death or life of a neuronal cell, and the functional polymorphisms in genes expressing these proteins have been found to promote apoptosis. To investigate the role of Bax and Bcl-2 genes in AD, we examined the presence of the 2 polymorphisms in peripheral blood. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical association study of these 2 functional SNPs using the peripheral blood of patients with AD. Bax (rs4645878) and Bcl-2 (rs2279115) in Alzheimer's patients (N = 132) and healthy controls (N = 109), aged 65 to 85 years, were analyzed by qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) using TaqMan probe technology. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS, 11.5. The differences between groups were analyzed using an independent-samples t test. The relationships between genotypes and alleles were analyzed using chi-square or likelihood ratio test. The Hardy-Weinberg balance was checked for the patient and control groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant. Sporadic AD patients and non-demented age matched control subjects were genotyped in this case-control study. No statistically significant relationship was found between the patients and controls for allele or genotype frequencies (p&gt;0.05). Our data suggest that these two polymorphisms do not contribute to AD in the population from the Mersin region of the Eastern Mediterranean. Further studies with larger sample sizes must be conducted to ascertain the association between the 2 polymorphisms.	2021	09	28	P R Health Sci J	Erdal	Mehmet Emin
33168821	10.1038/s41408-020-00382-3	Somatic copy number gains in MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 identifies a subset of aggressive alternative-DH/TH DLBCL patients.	Double/triple hit lymphoma (DH/TH), known as high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), is an aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), defined as having concurrent MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements. While gene rearrangements represent significant genetic events in cancer, copy number alterations (CNAs) also play an important role, and their contributions to rearrangements have yet to be fully elucidated. Using FISH and high-resolution CNA data, we defined the landscape of concurrent gene rearrangements and copy gains in MYC, BCL2, and BCL6, in a cohort of 479 newly diagnosed DLBCL. We also show that concurrent translocations and copy number alterations, in combinations similar to DH/TH, identify a unique subset of DLBCL, alternative DH/TH, that have survival outcomes similar to DH/TH DLBCL patients.	2021	05	06	Blood Cancer J	Krull	Jordan E
33233721	10.3390/ijms21228795	Identification of Recurrent Mutations in the microRNA-Binding Sites of B-Cell Lymphoma-Associated Genes in Follicular Lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common indolent B-cell lymphoma that can transform into the more aggressive transformed FL (tFL). However, the molecular process driving this transformation is uncertain. In this work, we aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites recurrently mutated in follicular lymphoma patients, as well as in transformed FL patients. Using whole-genome sequencing data from FL tumors, we discovered 544 mutations located in bioinformatically predicted microRNA-binding sites. We then studied these specific regions using targeted sequencing in a cohort of 55 FL patients, found 16 recurrent mutations, and identified a further 69 variants. After filtering for QC, we identified 21 genes with mutated miRNA-binding sites that were also enriched for B-cell-associated genes by Gene Ontology. Over 40% of mutations identified in these genes were present exclusively in tFL patients. We validated the predicted miRNA-binding sites of five of the genes by luciferase assay and demonstrated that the identified mutations in <i>BCL2</i> and <i>EZH2</i> genes impaired the binding efficiency of <i>miR-5008</i> and <i>miR-144</i> and regulated the endogenous levels of messenger RNA (mRNA).	2021	03	10	Int J Mol Sci	Larrea	Erika
33280526	10.1177/1533033820980098	microRNA-214 Prevents Traits of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma via VEGFA and Bcl-2.	Dysregulation of microRNA-214 (miR-214) has been indicated in different tumors. The function of miR-214 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is yet to be deciphered. The current study aimed to investigate the specific mechanism underpinning CSCC development with the involvement of miR-214 and its putative targets. Microarray analysis of CSCC and adjacent tissues was carried out to filter the most significant downregulated miRNA. Survival analysis of patients was subsequently implemented, followed by miRNA expression determination in CSCC cells. Gain-of-function assays were performed to evaluate its function on cellular level. The targets of the determined miRNA were predicted and their expression in CSCC and adjacent tissues was evaluated. The targeting relationship was analyzed by dual-luciferase assays. Finally, rescue experiments were conducted. miR-214 was reduced in CSCC tissues and cells, and the survival of patients harboring overexpression of miR-214 was higher. miR-214 restoration increased CSCC cell apoptosis, while decreased proliferative, invasive and migratory activities. miR-214 interacted with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). VEGFA and Bcl-2, overexpressed in CSCC tissues and cells, were negatively correlated with miR-214. Moreover, VEGFA and Bcl-2 overexpression reversed the anti-tumor phenotypes of miR-214 on CSCC cells. miR-214 disrupted the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through VEGFA and Bcl-2 in the CSCC cells. Our data demonstrates that miR-214 exerts a suppressing role in CSCC. The discovery of novel targets such as miR-214 and VEGFA/Bcl-2 may facilitate the development of therapeutic options.	2021	11	22	Technol Cancer Res Treat	Ma	Xianpeng
34171048	10.47162/RJME.61.4.01	Ovarian ectopic pregnancy: the role of complex morphopathological assay. Review and case presentation.	Ovarian ectopic pregnancy (OEP) represents the rarest type of ectopic pregnancy, accounting for 1-3% of this pathology. The diagnosis of this pathology is challenging due to the non-specific clinical aspects and the ultrasound examination hampered by the lack of visible gestational sac in the presence of hematocele and hemoperitoneum. The purpose of the extended histopathological (HP) examination was to identify particular aspects of the OEP trophoblast and to highlight potential local ovarian modifications which can determine pregnancy fixation at this level. The patient presented local favorable conditions for intraovarian nidation, conditions confirmed by the HP classical examination and by the immunohistochemical evaluation. We identified, using classical Hematoxylin-Eosin, Masson's trichrome and Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS)-Hematoxylin, necrotic hemorrhage, accentuated vascular thrombosis and high density lymphoplasmocytary infiltrate. These modifications increased local adhesivity and cell destruction through hypoperfusion. Anti-cluster of differentiation antibodies (CD34, CD38, tryptase) revealed the low number of intravillous vessels and the high number of macrophages and mastocytes involved in the local inflammatory process heighten. We identified the presence of trophoblast tissue in the ovarian structure using anti-cytokeratin AE1∕AE3 (CK AE1∕AE3)/anti-cytokeratin 7 (CK7) antibodies. The anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and anti-vimentin (VIM) antibodies displayed the density of myofibroblasts and intravillous stromal cells and with the aid of anti-progesterone receptor (PR) antibody, we identified the corpus luteum hormonal response in the OEP. The placental villosities present a blocked multiplication process at the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein, confirmed by the Ki67 cell proliferation and tumor protein 63 (p63) immunomarkers. Anti-neuron specific enolase (NSE), anti-calretinin and anti-inhibin A antibodies showed the particular aspects of the granulosa and internal theca cells, which may be involved in oocyte release blockage, intraluteal and extraluteal fecundation of the OEP.	2021	10	28	Rom J Morphol Embryol	Istrate-Ofiţeru	Anca Maria
29930300	10.1038/s41375-018-0176-z	The ribosomal RPL10 R98S mutation drives IRES-dependent BCL-2 translation in T-ALL.	The R98S mutation in ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10 R98S) affects 8% of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, and was previously described to impair cellular proliferation. The current study reveals that RPL10 R98S cells accumulate reactive oxygen species which promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP levels, causing the proliferation defect. RPL10 R98S mutant leukemia cells can survive high oxidative stress levels via a specific increase of IRES-mediated translation of the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), mediating BCL-2 protein overexpression. RPL10 R98S selective sensitivity to the clinically available Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax (ABT-199) was supported by suppression of splenomegaly and the absence of human leukemia cells in the blood of T-ALL xenografted mice. These results shed new light on the oncogenic function of ribosomal mutations in cancer, provide a novel mechanism for BCL-2 upregulation in leukemia, and highlight BCL-2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic opportunity in RPL10 R98S defective T-ALL.	2019	05	20	Leukemia	Kampen	Kim R

30304559	10.1002/jcb.27655	LINC00152 promotes the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by regulating B-cell lymphoma-2.	LINC00152 has been considered to be associated with the tumorigenesis and the occurrence of gastric cancer; however, the mechanism of LINC00152 has yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression levels of LINC00152 in tissues, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with gastric cancer were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The functions of LINC00152 with respect to the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasive abilities of the gastric cancer cells were evaluated by cell proliferation analysis, flow cytometry, cell scratch wound assay, and transwell migration experiments. A mouse xenotransplant model of gastric tumors was established to detect the role of LINC00152 in vivo, and the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins were investigated by Western blot analysis. The results revealed that LINC00152 was overexpressed in tissues, serum, and PBMCs of patients with gastric cancer. Moreover, LINC00152 could promote the migration and invasive abilities and suppress the apoptosis, of gastric cancer cells through regulating the Bcl-2 protein family. LINC00152 could bind with Bcl-2 directly to induce the activation of cell cycle signaling, and this may be a potential target for the therapy of gastric cancer in the future.	2020	06	19	J Cell Biochem	Mao	Ye
30306208	10.1007/s00277-018-3498-z	MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements in primary central nervous system lymphoma of large B cell type.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare specific subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma limited to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, or eyes without any systemic presentation and relapse which mostly takes place in CNS. In more than 95% of patients, it is of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. Categorizing PCNSL to germinal center cell like or activated B cell like, as we usually do for DLBCL NOS, may not be applicable for predicting outcome. Possible prognostic significance of MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements may be important given what we know about their impact in systemic DLBCL, but we have limited knowledge about the status of double or triple hit molecular changes in PCNSL. Here, we have investigated prevalence of these molecular alterations in PCNSL. Two independent tissue microarrays constructed from 78 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of confirmed PCNSL were tested for rearrangement of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using break apart dual color probes. BCL6 translocation was detected in 15 (12%) cases. Translocation involving MYC and BCL2 was identified in 3 cases (3.8%) and 1 case (1.3%) respectively. One double hit lymphoma was discovered with both MYC/BCL2 translocation (1.3%). To the best of our knowledge, few organized studies have been conducted for MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangement in PCNSL. This study is evaluating large number of PCNSL.

30535471	10.3892/ijmm.2018.4019	MicroRNA-497 inhibits multiple myeloma growth and increases susceptibility to bortezomib by targeting Bcl-2.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common severe hematopoietic malignancy occuring in aged population. MicroRNA (miR)‑497 was previously reported to contribute to the apoptosis of other cell types, presumably through targeting B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2). In the present study, miRNA and protein expression levels were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. The cell proliferation and viability was measured using 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2, 5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide and plate clonality assays, and the cell growth cycle was measured with a flow cytometer. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)‑mediated dUTP nick‑end‑labeling, Annexin V and caspase‑3 activity assays were performed to examine the cell apoptotic rates. The results showed that miR‑497 was markedly decreased, whereas Bcl‑2 was enhanced in MM tissues and cell lines. miR‑497 targeted Bcl‑2 and affected its downstream apoptosis‑related genes. The overexpression of miR‑497 promoted MM cell apoptosis through cell cycle arrest, and decreased colony genesis ability and viability. In addition, miR‑497 increased the sensitivity of MM cells to bortezomib. Taken together, miR‑497 suppressed MM cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis by directly targeting Bcl‑2 and altering the expression of downstream apoptosis‑related proteins. The combination of miR‑497 and bortezomib may enhance drug sensitivity, serving as a potentially available therapeutic method for MM.	2019	05	20	Int J Mol Med	Tian	Faqing
30569090	10.3892/mmr.2018.9738	miR‑15a‑3p affects the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of lens epithelial cells.	The present study investigated the effect of microRNA (miR)‑15a‑3p on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of lens epithelial cells and its potential mechanism, in order to further elucidate the pathogenesis of age‑related cataracts (ARCs). The HLE‑B3 human lens epithelial cell line was transfected with miR‑15a‑3p mimic. Expression of the miR‑15a‑3p mimic was measured by fluorescence‑based reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration were investigated using MTT and plate clone formation assays, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and flow cytometry, and a wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The protein expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) were also compared between transfected and wild‑type HLE‑B3 cells by western blot analysis. The results showed that transfection with the miR‑15a‑3p mimic significantly suppressed the proliferation of HLE‑B3 cells, induced cell apoptosis and increased the proportion of early apoptotic cells. The migration of HLE‑B3 cells was significantly inhibited following transfection with miR‑15a‑3p mimic (P&lt;0.01), whereas cell invasion was unaffected (P&gt;0.05). In addition, reduced protein levels of BCL2 and MCL1 were observed in the miR‑15a‑3p mimic‑transfected HLE‑B3 cells (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, miR‑15a‑3p may suppress cell proliferation and migration, and induce cell apoptosis in lens epithelial cells through inhibiting the expression of BCL2 and MCL1, which contributes to the onset of ARCs.	2019	05	24	Mol Med Rep	Liu	Shu-Jun
30575108	10.1002/ajh.25385	IGH translocations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes.	The prevalence, clinicopathologic correlates, and outcomes of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with IGH-BCL2 and IGH-BCL3 translocations are not well known. Using the Mayo Clinic CLL database, we identified patients seen between March 1, 2002 and September 30, 2016 who had FISH testing performed within 3 years of CLL diagnosis. The prognostic profile, time to first therapy (TTT), and overall survival (OS) of patients with IGH-BCL2 and IGH-BCL3 translocation were compared to patients without these abnormalities (non-IGH group). Of 1684 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 38 (2.2%) had IGH-BCL2, and 16 (0.9%) had IGH-BCL3 translocation at diagnosis. Patients with IGH-BCL3 translocation were more likely to have high and very-high CLL-International Prognostic Index, compared to patients with IGH-BCL2 translocation and the non-IGH group. The 5-year probability of requiring therapy was significantly higher for IGH-BCL3 compared to IGH-BCL2 and non-IGH groups (84% vs 33% vs 29%, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001). The 5-year OS was significantly shorter for IGH-BCL3 compared to IGH-BCL2 and non-IGH groups (45% vs 89% vs 86%, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001). On multivariable analyses, IGH-BCL3 translocation was associated with a shorter TTT (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7; P = 0.005) and shorter OS (HR = 5.5; P &lt; 0.0001); IGH-BCL2 translocation did not impact TTT and OS. In conclusion, approximately 3% of all newly diagnosed CLL patients have either an IGH-BCL2 or IGH-BCL3 translocation. Patients with IGH-BCL3 translocations have a distinct prognostic profile and outcome. These results support the inclusion of an IGH probe during the routine evaluation of FISH abnormalities in newly diagnosed CLL.	2019	12	26	Am J Hematol	Fang	Hong
30623427	10.1002/jcp.28091	The Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax inhibits Nrf2 antioxidant pathway activation induced by hypomethylating agents in AML.	Induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an important process for the cytotoxicity of various acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapies including hypomethylating agents (HMAs), concurrently activates the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response pathway which in turn results in induction of antioxidant enzymes that neutralize ROS. In this study, we demonstrated that Nrf2 inhibition is an additional mechanism responsible for the marked antileukemic activity in AML seen with the combination of HMAs and venetoclax (ABT-199). HMA and venetoclax combined treatment augmented mitochondrial ROS induction and apoptosis compared with treatment HMA alone. Treatment of AML cell lines as well as primary AML cells with venetoclax disrupted HMA decitabine-increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and induction of downstream antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 and NADP-quinone oxidoreductase-1. Venetoclax treatment also leads to dissociation of B-cell lymphoma 2 from the Nrf2/Keap-1 complex and targets Nrf2 to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, our results here demonstrated an undiscovered mechanism underlying synergistic effect of decitabine and venetoclax in AML cells, elucidating for impressive results in antileukemic activity against AML in preclinical and early clinical studies by combined treatment of these drugs.	2020	05	26	J Cell Physiol	Nguyen	Le Xuan Truong
30681073	10.12659/MSM.912082	Berberine Promotes Apoptosis of Colorectal Cancer via Regulation of the Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNA) Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 2 (CASC2)/AU-Binding Factor 1 (AUF1)/B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) Axis.	BACKGROUND Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid derived from Berberis genus plants, has been reported to have anti-cancer effects. While cell behavior can be modulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the contributions of lncRNAs in progression and berberine effects on colorectal cancer are largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the involvement and regulatory function of lncRNA cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (CASC2) during the treatment of human colorectal cancer using berberine. MATERIAL AND METHODS Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of lncRNA CASC2 and Bcl-2 mRNA in colorectal cancer cells. MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell viability. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to analyze the apoptosis of cancer cells. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was done to verify the interaction between lncRNA CASC2 and (AU-binding factor 1) AUF1, or AUF1 and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). RESULTS Treatment with berberine suppressed cell viability of colorectal cancer by promoting apoptosis level. LncRNA CASC2 was upregulated in cells treated with berberine, and knockdown of lncRNA CASC2 reversed the berberine-induced apoptosis. In addition, anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 was suppressed by berberine treatment and lncRNA CASC2, inducing the pro-apoptotic effects. Moreover, lncRNA CASC2 binds to AUF1, which sequestered AUF1 from binding to Bcl-2 mRNA, thus inducing the inactivation of Bcl-2 translation. CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals that lncRNA CASC2 mediates the berberine-induced pro-apoptotic effect via inhibition of Bcl-2 expression at the post-transcriptional level.	2019	04	22	Med Sci Monit	Dai	Wei
30741252	10.12659/MSM.912148	microRNA-205 and microRNA-338-3p Reduces Cell Apoptosis in Prostate Carcinoma Tissue and LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells by Directly Targeting the B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) Gene.	BACKGROUND The inhibitor of apoptosis, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), is encoded by the BCL2 gene. Previous studies have shown that microRNAs are downregulated in prostate cancer. This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-205 and microRNA-338-3p and cell apoptosis in prostate carcinoma tissue and the LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line by directly targeting the BCL2 gene and Bcl-2 protein expression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Bioinformatics methods predicted the target genes of miR-205 and miR-338-3p, which were validated by a luciferase assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect Bcl-2 protein expression in 30 samples of prostate carcinoma tissue and 30 matched samples of normal prostate. The normal prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1, and LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cells studied in vitro. BCL2 mRNA expression and Bcl-2 protein expression were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using annexin V, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and phycoerythrin (annexin V-FITC/PE). RESULTS TargetScan Human 7.2 predicted that the structures of miR-205 and miR-338-3p had a binding site on the proto-oncogene, BCL2, which was verified by a luciferase assay. The expression of miR-205 and miR-338-3p were significantly downregulated in prostate carcinoma tissues and LNCaP cells when compared with normal controls. BCL2 expression was significantly inhibited by overexpression of miR-205 and miR-338-3p in LNCaP cells. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study showed that miR-205 and miR-338-3p downregulated the expression of the BCL2 gene and decreased apoptosis in prostate carcinoma.	2019	04	29	Med Sci Monit	Zhang	Xi
30747219	10.3892/or.2019.6980	Stanniocalcin‑1 promotes cell proliferation, chemoresistance and metastasis in hypoxic gastric cancer cells via Bcl‑2.	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most lethal diseases worldwide, but the mechanism of GC development remains elusive. In the present study, the roles of stanniocalcin‑1 (STC1) in GC were investigated. It was demonstrated that overexpression of STC1 mRNA and protein were associated with poor survival of patients with GC. The expression of STC1 was enhanced in hypoxic GC cells and overexpression of STC1 facilitated cell proliferation in hypoxia but not in normoxia. Furthermore, STC1 promoted chemoresistance, migration and invasion in hypoxia. Upregulating the expression of STC1 enhanced the expression of B cell lymphoma (Bcl)‑2, neural‑cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase‑2, whereas it reduced the levels of cytochrome c, cleaved‑caspase‑9, cleaved‑caspase‑3 and epithelial‑cadherin. However, downregulation of STC1 altered the expression of these proteins in the opposite direction. Furthermore, disturbing the expression of Bcl‑2 partly reversed the changes to these proteins and also the pro‑proliferation, anti‑apoptosis and pro‑invasion potential of STC1. In vivo experiments indicated that enhanced expression of STC1 promoted tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Collectively, the results indicated that STC1 may serve an oncogenic role in hypoxic GC via dysregulating Bcl‑2, indicating that STC1 may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of GC.	2019	03	06	Oncol Rep	Wang	Yan
30747227	10.3892/mmr.2019.9883	Long noncoding RNA GAS5 promotes apoptosis in primary nucleus pulposus cells derived from the human intervertebral disc via Bcl‑2 downregulation and caspase‑3 upregulation.	Nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) apoptosis serves an important role in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD); however, the roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this process remain unknown. The present study aimed to determine the effects of the lncRNA growth arrest‑specific transcript 5 (GAS5) on the apoptosis of primary human NPCs derived from the intervertebral disc, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. TargetScan was used to predict the lncRNAs targeted by microRNA‑155 (miR‑155). Then, NPCs were subjected to lentivirus‑mediated transduction of miR‑155 or GAS5. A human lncRNA and mRNA array was used to screen differentially expressed lncRNAs following miR‑155 overexpression. GAS5 and miR‑155 expression levels were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After GAS5 overexpression, apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry via Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Western blotting was employed to determine the expression of apoptosis‑associated proteins, including caspase‑3 and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2). TargetScan indicated GAS5 had one binding site for miR‑155. Following exogenous transfection of miR‑155 mimics, GAS5 expression levels in NPCs were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05). Interestingly, miR‑155 overexpression in NPCs resulted in 721 differentially expressed lncRNAs compared with the negative control group (P&lt;0.05), including 492 and 229 upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs respectively. In addition, 18 transcripts of GAS5 exhibited a downregulated expression profile. GAS5 overexpression in NPCs resulted in enhanced caspase‑3 decreased Bcl‑2 expression levels; the apoptosis of NPCs was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). The results of the present study revealed that overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 may promotes NPC apoptosis via Bcl‑2 downregulation and caspase‑3 upregulation, which may be associated with miR‑155. The results of the present study suggest that lncRNA GAS5‑silenced NPCs, or lentivirus‑mediated lncRNA GAS5 knockdown may be precise and effective therapeutic strategies in the treatment of IDD.	2019	06	24	Mol Med Rep	Wang	Yifeng
30801855	10.1111/odi.13070	Bcl-2 is a prognostic marker and its silencing inhibits recurrence in ameloblastomas.	Ameloblastomas are the most common odontogenic epithelial tumors with high recurrence rate. The aim of this study was to identify apoptosis-related genes with recurrence of ameloblastomas and to evaluate its feasibility as a prognostic marker and as a target molecule preventing from recurrence. Public microarray data were analyzed. To evaluate their expression in ameloblastoma patients, immunohistochemical staining was performed in 89 human ameloblastoma tissues. Quantitative PCR was performed by use of ameloblastoma cell line (AM-1). Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis and western blotting were conducted following transfection with siRNA. Further, AM-1 cells were implanted in the renal subcapsular layer of immunodeficient mice. Microarray data analysis revealed that osteoprotegerin (OPG) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were the two most upregulated genes in ameloblastoma. Only Bcl-2 expression was significantly (p = 0.020) associated with recurrence in conservative treatment group (n = 17) among 89 patients. Silencing of Bcl-2 increased apoptosis in AM-1 cells in vitro and inhibited tumor nodule formation of AM-1 cells in vivo. These results suggest that Bcl-2 expression is a useful biomarker to predict recurrence of ameloblastomas, and as a therapeutic target molecule to prevent recurrence of ameloblastoma.	2019	12	30	Oral Dis	Kim	Jue Young
30842155	10.21873/anticanres.13235	Digital Analysis of BCL2 Expression in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	Deregulation of apoptosis is critical regarding the development and progression of malignancies, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). B-Cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) (gene locus:18q21.33), located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, acts mainly as an anti-apoptotic factor suppressing and blocking apoptotic signal transduction. Fifty (n=50) primary LSCC tissue sections were used. Immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis were implemented for evaluating BCL2 protein expression levels. High BCL2 protein expression levels were observed in 21/50 (42%) LSCC tissue sections, whereas the remaining cases (n=29) demonstrated a low expression. Overall, BCL2 expression was associated with grade (p=0.046) and anatomical region of the examined malignancies (transglottic, p=0.047). Interestingly, high BCL2 expression levels were strongly associated with radiotherapy-based only regimens (p=0.01) in corresponding patients. BCL2 overexpression was found to be correlated with an aggressive phenotype (advanced grade of differentiation) in LSCC, also demonstrating a potential selective anatomic localization (transglotic region). Additionally, BCL2 overexpression appears to be a negative regulator for successful radiotherapy implementation by reducing the apoptotic process in patients.	2019	03	11	Anticancer Res	Chrysovergis	Aristeidis
30940629	10.1124/dmd.118.085605	Prediction of Human Nonlinear Pharmacokinetics of a New Bcl-2 Inhibitor Using PBPK Modeling and Interspecies Extrapolation Strategy.	S 55746 ((S)-<i>N</i>-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(6-(3-(morpholinomethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-<i>N</i>-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroindolizine-1-carboxamide) is a new selective Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) inhibitor developed by Servier Laboratories and used to restore apoptosis functions in cancer patients. The aim of this work was to develop a translational approach using physiologically based (PB) pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling for interspecies extrapolation to anticipate the nonlinear PK behavior of this new compound in patients. A PBPK mouse model was first built using a hybrid approach, defining scaling factors (determined from in vitro data) to correct in vitro clearance parameters and predicted <i>Kp</i> (partition coefficient) values. The qualification of the hybrid model using these empirically determined scaling factors was satisfactorily completed with rat and dog data, allowing extrapolation of the PBPK model to humans. Human PBPK simulations were then compared with clinical trial data from a phase 1 trial in which the drug was given orally and daily to cancer patients. Human PBPK predictions were within the 95% prediction interval for the eight dose levels, taking into account both the nonlinear dose and time dependencies occurring in S 55746 kinetics. Thus, the proposed PK interspecies extrapolation strategy, based on preclinical and in vitro information and physiologic assumptions, could be a useful tool for predicting human plasma concentrations at the early stage of drug development.	2020	02	20	Drug Metab Dispos	Pierrillas	Philippe B
31036603	10.1042/BSR20182321	miR-1915-3p inhibits Bcl-2 expression in the development of gastric cancer.	Many gene expressions changed during the development of gastric cancer, and non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to regulate cancer progression by participating in the process of tumor cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Our previous study has identified 29 miRNAs that are highly expressed in gastric cancer stem cells. One of these miRNAs, miR-1915-3p, has shown great potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the cancers in liver, colon and thyroid, as well as in immune and kidney diseases. Herein, we found that miR-1915-3p exhibited low expression level in differentiated gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues. It was found that the miR-1915-3p inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells and thus promoted cell apoptosis. We discovered that the expressions of miR-1915-3p were significantly correlated to the lymph node metastasis and overall survival of patients with gastric cancer. Further study showed that there was a negative correlation between miR-1915-3p and Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2) expression, suggesting that Bcl-2 was a target gene of miR-1915-3p. Hence, miR-1915-3p possibly contributes to the development and progression of gastric cancer by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The finding provides a potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.	2020	07	01	Biosci Rep	Cui	Hong-Wei
31103719	10.1016/j.canlet.2019.05.009	A feedforward relationship between active Rac1 and phosphorylated Bcl-2 is critical for sustaining Bcl-2 phosphorylation and promoting cancer progression.	Active GTPase-Rac1 is associated with cellular processes involved in carcinogenesis and expression of Bcl-2 endows cells with the ability to evade apoptosis. Here we provide evidence that active Rac1 and Bcl-2 work in a positive feedforward loop to promote sustained phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at serine-70 (S70pBcl-2), which stabilizes its anti-apoptotic activity. Pharmacological and genetic inactivation of Rac1 prevent interaction with Bcl-2 and reduce S70pBcl-2. Similarly, BH3-mimetic inhibitors of Bcl-2 could disrupt Rac1-Bcl-2 interaction and reduce S70pBcl-2. This effect of active Rac1 could also be rescued by scavengers of intracellular superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>), thus implicating NOX-activating activity of Rac1 in promoting S70pBcl-2. Moreover, active Rac1-mediated redox-dependent S70pBcl-2 involves the inhibition of phosphatase PP2A holoenzyme assembly. Sustained S70pBcl-2 in turn secures Rac1/Bcl-2 interaction. Importantly, inhibiting Rac1 activity, scavenging O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup> or employing BH3-mimetic inhibitor significantly reduced S70pBcl-2-mediated survival in cancer cells. Notably, Rac1 expression, and its interaction with Bcl-2, positively correlate with S70pBcl-2 levels in patient-derived lymphoma tissues and with advanced stage lymphoma and melanoma. Together, we provide evidence of a positive feedforward loop involving active Rac1, S70pBcl-2 and PP2A, which could have potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.	2020	04	27	Cancer Lett	Chong	Stephen Jun Fei
31127909	10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.5.1463	C-MYC and BCL2: Correlation between Protein Over-Expression and Gene Translocation and Impact on Outcome in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma	Background: Due to lack of availability of gene expression profiling (GEP) for most developing countries andclinicians; the immunohistochemistry (IHC) is mostly used in the clinical application. The aim of our study is to checkthe possibility of using IHC to detect MYC and BCL2 in our patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)instead of GEP to stratify them into high and low-risk groups. This will help in a proper treatment choice of subsequentimprovement in the survival outcome. Method: During the study period, 90 DLBCL patients were eligible. MYC andBCL2 evaluated by IHC and gene rearrangement by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and correlated with clinical-pathologicalfeatures and survival. Results: Through IHC, the expression of MYC, BCL2, and double expression was detectedin 35.6%, 46.7% and 30% of patients, respectively. While by RT-PCR, it was 4.53±0.74 for MYC compared with2.18±0.78 for BCL-2. Most patients with BCL2+/MYC+; double-expressor and double-hit lymphomas (DEL andDHL) had high stage (III, IV), more extra-nodal involvement, (P value &lt;0.001) and intermediate to high InternationalPrognostic Index (IPI) risk profile (P-value &lt;0.001). The median overall survival was 14 months and 6 months for DELand DHL, respectively. While all patients with DHL died during the follow-up period, the median PFS were only 2months for DEL. There was a statistically significant correlation between mRNA of MYC and BCL2 with their proteinexpression (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Our results confirmed the unique characters and poor outcome associated withDEL and DHL mandated the need for more intense therapy and not the standard protocol. Moreover, the significantcorrelation between protein overexpression and gene rearrangement may open the door for the possibility to use IHCinstead of RT-PCR in developing countries.	2019	11	22	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Mohammed	Amrallah A
31145521	10.1111/cas.14083	Cysteine-rich protein 61 regulates the chemosensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia to imatinib mesylate through the nuclear factor kappa B/Bcl-2 pathway.	Although the targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) has achieved significant responses against CML in the clinical setting, a small proportion of patients fail to respond to IM treatment and their disease continues to progress, indicating resistance to IM therapy. As a secreted extracellular matrix protein, cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) plays an important role in the resistance of solid tumors to chemotherapy, but its role in CML is unclear. In the present study, we observed that Cyr61 levels were upregulated in the plasma and bone marrow (BM) of patients with CML as well as in K562 cells. This upregulation of Cyr61 significantly decreased IM-induced cellular apoptosis of K562 cells through nuclear factor kappa B/B-cell lymphoma 2 pathways. Inhibition of Cyr61 restored the chemosensitivity of K562 cells to IM both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results showed for the first time that Cyr61 plays an important role in regulating the chemosensitivity of CML cells to IM, suggesting that selectively targeting Cyr61 directly or its relevant effector pathways may provide potential value in improving the clinical response of patients with CML to IM treatment.	2019	08	13	Cancer Sci	Song	Yanfang
31160589	10.1038/s41467-019-10363-1	Structures of BCL-2 in complex with venetoclax reveal the molecular basis of resistance mutations.	Venetoclax is a first-in-class cancer therapy that interacts with the cellular apoptotic machinery promoting apoptosis. Treatment of patients suffering chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with this BCL-2 antagonist has revealed emergence of a drug-selected BCL-2 mutation (G101V) in some patients failing therapy. To understand the molecular basis of this acquired resistance we describe the crystal structures of venetoclax bound to both BCL-2 and the G101V mutant. The pose of venetoclax in its binding site on BCL-2 reveals small but unexpected differences as compared to published structures of complexes with venetoclax analogues. The G101V mutant complex structure and mutant binding assays reveal that resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152, with venetoclax binding restored by a E152A mutation. This provides a framework for considering analogues of venetoclax that might be effective in combating this mutation.	2019	06	24	Nat Commun	Birkinshaw	Richard W
31203382	10.1007/s00411-019-00802-4	Hypoxia inducible factor-1α/B-cell lymphoma 2 signaling impacts radiosensitivity of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cells in a normoxic environment.	Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a critical transcriptional factor for the response of cells to hypoxic microenvironment and its expression induces resistance of hypoxic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to radiotherapy. This study investigated how the activation of HIF-1α/B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) signaling under normoxic conditions impacted radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. The recombinant pcDNA3.0-EGFP plasmids with wild-type or mutant HIF-1α complementary DNA (cDNA) were transfected into H1299 cells, an NSCLC cell line, establishing two H1299 sublines with high expression of HIF-1α. Compared with the levels of HIF-1α and BCL-2 proteins in non-transfected cells, increased levels of both proteins were found in transfected cells. Moreover, the expression of HIF-1α in non-transfected cells induced by chloride cobalt (CoCl<sub>2</sub>), a commonly used mimetic hypoxia reagent, was concomitant with the enhancement of BCL-2 expression. Conversely, reduction of HIF-1α expression by an inhibitor decreased the levels of BCL-2 proteins. The results revealed that the stabilization and expression of HIF-1α promoted the accumulation of BCL-2 proteins in H1299 cells. Subsequent experiments showed that intracellular HIF-1α/BCL-2 signaling was triggered in a normoxic environment after H1299 cells were exposed to irradiation, causing an elevated radioresistance. In contrast, blockage of HIF-1α/BCL-2 signaling leads to an elevated radiosensitivity. Proliferation of cells assay showed that, under normoxic conditions, population doubling times (PDTs) of irradiated cells were prolonged by suppression of HIF-1α/BCL-2 signaling. It is, therefore, indicated that HIF-1α/BCL-2 signaling activated by ionizing radiation reduces the radiosensitivity of H1299 cells independent of the hypoxic environment.	2020	04	01	Radiat Environ Biophys	Wang	Gang
31218746	10.1002/jcb.29207	miR-34a-5p was involved in chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced autophagy of human coronary artery endothelial cells via Bcl-2/beclin 1 signal transduction pathway.	Autophagy refers to the genetically regulated process to regulate the survival and death of cells, which is conserved in evolution. Typically, autophagy exerts a vital part under physiopathological conditions. Whether autophagy can be resulted from chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a prominent characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), remains to be investigated. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as the regulating factors in a variety of benign and malignant diseases; nonetheless, it remains to be fully illustrated about the way by which miRNAs modulate autophagy. According to our results, for human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), CIH increased the expression of autophagy-associated proteins, which depended on the concentration and time; besides, it could promote autophagic vacuole (AV) formation. In addition, CIH could activate beclin 1, which was dependent on dose and time. In HCAECs, microRNA-34a-5p (miR-34a-5p) was overexpressed after exposed to CIH, and its target protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was downregulated. Moreover, inhibiting miR-34a-5p increased Bcl-2 and p62 expression, while downregulating beclin 1, Vps34, Atg5, and LC3 levels, implying the role of miR-34a-5p in CIH-induced autophagy. Moreover, exogenous upregulation of Bcl-2 could block miR-34a-5p influence on CIH-induced autophagy through suppressing beclin 1 expression. Additionally, beclin 1 could enhance the autophagy induced by CIH. In conclusion, overexpression of miR-34a-5p activated beclin 1 through Bcl-2 inhibition in CIH and participated in CIH-induced autophagy.	2020	09	08	J Cell Biochem	Lv	Xin

31315646	10.1186/s13000-019-0856-7	Prognostic impact of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with extra copies of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6: comparison with double/triple hit lymphoma and double expressor lymphoma.	The poor outcome of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, with rearrangements of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6, also known as double-hit lymphoma or triple-hit lymphoma (DHL or THL), has been well documented, while the clinical significance of extra copies of MYC, BCL2 or BCL6 are still less well known. In total, 130 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS) were included in our study. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed in all cases to evaluate the genetic status and protein expression levels of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6. Among the 130 cases of DLBCL, the prevalence rates of extra copies of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 were 10.8, 20.0 and 14.6%, respectively, and the corresponding rates of gene rearrangement were 10.0, 14.6 and 16.9%, respectively. In total, 7.7% (10/130) of patients were DHL/THL; 9.2% (12/130) of patients were DLBCL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene abnormalities including rearrangements or extra copies, while excluded DHL/THL. The positive protein expression rates of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 were 46.9% (61), 75.4% (98) and 70.0% (91), respectively. Among the 51 cases with MYC/BCL2 co-expression, 14 cases showed concurrence of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 genetic abnormalities, and the remaining 37 cases were classified as double-expressor lymphoma (DEL). MYC and BCL2 rearrangement and BCL2 extra copies were all associated with upregulated protein expression. Cases with concurrence of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 genetic abnormalities were both associated with MYC/BCL2 co-expression. Patients with concurrence of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 genetic abnormalities excluded DHL/THL had shorter OS (P &lt; 0.001) than patients with DLBCL with no genetic change, and showed no statistical different with patients with DHL/THL (P = 0.419). Extra copies of MYC was independent prognostic factors for DLBCL. Patients with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene extra copies might show a trend towards poor prognosis, and the detection of extra copies of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 might deserve more attention.	2020	02	18	Diagn Pathol	Huang	Sixia
31337422	10.1186/s13148-019-0706-1	Suv39h1 promotes facet joint chondrocyte proliferation by targeting miR-15a/Bcl2 in idiopathic scoliosis patients.	Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a complex disease with an unclear etiology, and the worldwide prevalence is approximately 2-3%. As an important link between environmental factors and phenotypic differences, epigenetic changes, such as lncRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation, have recently been reported to be associated with the development of IS. However, the correlation between histone methylation, another classical epigenetic mechanism, and IS has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the morphological changes, alterations in the levels of histone methylation, and cell proliferation-related pathway in inferior facet joint cartilage in 11 IS patients and 10 comparable controls. Compared with the control group, narrowed facet joint cartilage but increased proliferative chondrocytes and upregulated collagen type II (COL2A1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) were observed in IS patients. Additionally, tri-methylation levels of H3K9 (H3K9me3) rather than other lysine sites were significantly increased in IS patients, coinciding with the upregulation of its specific enzyme, suppressor of variegation 3-9, drosophila homolog of 1 (SUV39H1). In addition, Bcl2-targeted miR-15a was downregulated in IS patients, and the level of H3K9me3 in the promoter region of the miR-15a host gene was remarkably increased in IS patients compared with the control group. Moreover, overexpressing SUV39H1 in ATDC5 cells with increased H3K9me3 levels led to similar changes, with increased expression of COL2A1 and Bcl2, decreased expression of miR-15a, and increased cell proliferation. Thus, our study suggests that increased chondrocyte proliferation occurs in the facet joint cartilage of IS patients compared with the control group and may be promoted by the elevated levels of H3K9me3 and SUV39H1, which regulate the miR-15a/Bcl2 pathway. This dysregulation of chondrocyte proliferation could result in abnormal spinal growth and may additionally participate in the development and progression of IS.	2020	06	26	Clin Epigenetics	Li	Jiong
31358732	10.1038/s41419-019-1801-0	Prediction of venetoclax activity in precursor B-ALL by functional assessment of apoptosis signaling.	Deregulated cell death pathways contribute to leukemogenesis and treatment failure in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Intrinsic apoptosis signaling is regulated by different proapoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules: proapoptotic BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) proteins activate prodeath molecules leading to cellular death, while antiapoptotic molecules including B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) prevent activation of prodeath proteins and counter-regulate apoptosis induction. Inhibition of these antiapoptotic regulators has become a promising strategy for anticancer treatment, but variable anticancer activities in different malignancies indicate the need for upfront identification of responsive patients. Here, we investigated the activity of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN, ABT-199) in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and found heterogeneous sensitivities in BCP-ALL cell lines and in a series of patient-derived primografts. To identify parameters of sensitivity and resistance, we evaluated genetic aberrations, gene-expression profiles, expression levels of apoptosis regulators, and functional apoptosis parameters analyzed by mitochondrial profiling using recombinant BH3-like peptides. Importantly, ex vivo VEN sensitivity was most accurately associated with functional BCL-2 dependence detected by BH3 profiling. Modeling clinical application of VEN in a preclinical trial in a set of individual ALL primografts, we identified that leukemia-free survival of VEN treated mice was precisely determined by functional BCL-2 dependence. Moreover, the predictive value of ex vivo measured functional BCL-2 dependence for preclinical in vivo VEN response was confirmed in an independent set of primograft ALL including T- and high risk-ALL. Thus, integrative analysis of the apoptosis signaling indicating mitochondrial addiction to BCL-2 accurately predicts antileukemia activity of VEN, robustly identifies VEN-responsive patients, and provides information for stratification and clinical guidance in future clinical applications of VEN in patients with ALL.	2020	07	30	Cell Death Dis	Seyfried	Felix
31379128	10.15252/embr.201847026	Checkpoint kinase 1 is essential for fetal and adult hematopoiesis.	Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is critical for S-phase fidelity and preventing premature mitotic entry in the presence of DNA damage. Tumor cells have developed a strong dependence on CHK1 for survival, and hence, this kinase has developed into a promising drug target. Chk1 deficiency in mice results in blastocyst death due to G2/M checkpoint failure showing that it is an essential gene and may be difficult to target therapeutically. Here, we show that chemical inhibition of CHK1 kills murine and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by the induction of BCL2-regulated apoptosis. Cell death in HSPCs is independent of p53 but requires the BH3-only proteins BIM, PUMA, and NOXA. Moreover, Chk1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo. Noteworthy, cell death inhibition in HSPCs cannot restore blood cell formation as HSPCs lacking CHK1 accumulate DNA damage and stop dividing. Moreover, conditional deletion of Chk1 in hematopoietic cells of adult mice selects for blood cells retaining CHK1, suggesting an essential role in maintaining functional hematopoiesis. Our findings establish a previously unrecognized role for CHK1 in establishing and maintaining hematopoiesis.	2020	04	28	EMBO Rep	Schuler	Fabian
31397599	10.1139/cjpp-2018-0743	Inhibition of microRNA-34a mediates protection of thymosin beta 4 in endothelial progenitor cells against advanced glycation endproducts by targeting B-cell lymphoma 2.	The aim of our work was to test whether thymosin beta 4 protected endothelial progenitor cells against apoptosis induced by advanced glycation endproducts and investigate the underlying mechanism. Treatment with thymosin beta 4 or transfection with microRNA-34a inhibitor enhanced cell viability, reduced apoptosis, abated oxidative stress, and attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial progenitor cells exposed to advanced glycation endproducts. Incubation with advanced glycation endproducts led to increased levels of microRNA-34a, which was attenuated by treatment with thymosin beta 4. Transfection with microRNA-34a reversed the beneficial effect of thymosin beta 4 against injuries induced by advanced glycation endproducts. The microRNA-34a could directly bind to the 3'UTRs of the mRNA of B-cell lymphoma 2, and thymosin beta 4 treatment upregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 expression in endothelial progenitor cells exposed to advanced glycation endproducts. More importantly, knockdown of B-cell lymphoma 2 abolished the protection of thymosin beta 4 and microRNA-34a inhibitor against advanced glycation endproducts. In conclusion, inhibition of microRNA-34a mediated protection of thymosin beta 4 in endothelial progenitor cells against advanced glycation endproducts by targeting B-cell lymphoma 2, which was helpful for understanding the therapeutic potential of thymosin beta 4 for diabetic patients.	2020	03	05	Can J Physiol Pharmacol	Chen	Qi
31410188	10.7150/thno.36254	Repurposing Brigatinib for the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Based on Inhibition of ER-phagy.	<b>Rationale</b>: The sustained and severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cancer cells may contribute to apoptotic cell death, thus representing a potential target for cancer therapy. Brigatinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it remains unclear if brigatinib has alternative model of action to exert antitumor effect in ALK-negative cancers. <b>Methods</b>: ALK-positive NSCLC cells and various human ALK-negative cancer cells, especially human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were used to examine the tumor suppression effect of brigatinib alone or in combination with autophagy inhibitors <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. A variety of biochemical assays were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of brigatinib in CRC cells. <b>Results</b>: Here, we show the significant anti-cancer effect of brigatinib in CRC through induction of apoptosis by sustained ER stress. Mechanistically, brigatinib induces ER stress via promoting the interaction between ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5 (USP5), a deubiquitinase, and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8 (ORP8), leading to ORP8 deubiquitination, accumulation and growth inhibition. Furthermore, we find that brigatinib-mediated ER stress simultaneously induces autophagic response via ER-phagy that acts as a protective mechanism to relieve excessive ER stress. As such, combination of brigatinib with autophagy inhibitors significantly enhances the anti-CRC effect of brigatinib both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, supporting the repurposing of brigatinib in CRC, independently of ALK. <b>Conclusion</b>: The unearthed new molecular action of brigatinib suggests that therapeutic modulation of ER stress and autophagy might represent a valid strategy to treat CRC and perhaps other ALK-negative cancers.	2020	08	20	Theranostics	Zhang	Zhe
31417030	10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1455_17	Apoptosis gene reprograming of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced by radioiodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I) irradiation.	The nature of adaptable change of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and/or Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX) gene expression in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) irradiated by radioiodine in thyroid diseases therapy is not fully understood. In this study, the alternation of apoptotic gene expression was evaluated while the PBMCs collected from healthy volunteers were irradiated by the radioiodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I). Fasting blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers. PBMCs from group 0 to 6 were incubated and exposed to different doses of <sup>131</sup>I in cell suspension for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. The apoptosis rates and expression of BCL-2 and BAX genes of PBMCs were examined. The apoptosis rate in the human PBMCs was gradually enhanced after six hour irradiation. The values of BCL-2 and BAX gene expression in groups 1-6 were higher than in group 0 within 6 h of irradiation, and then, these were decreased gradually from 6 to 12 h. -2 gene expression increased in groups 1-3 after 12 h irradiation, but there was no difference in groups 4-6. The ratio of BCL-2/BAX gene expression among groups 4-6 gradually decreased during the period from 6 to 12 h, and it was significantly lower than in the group 0 at 12, 24 and 48 h. The expression of BCL-2 and BAX genes was initially upregulated following irradiation. Later, the balance of BCL-2/BAX genes expression was adjusted, and then, PBMCs underwent apoptosis at higher doses of radiation.	2020	02	18	Indian J Med Res	Li	Jian-Fang
31485613	10.3892/mmr.2019.10610	Rsf‑1 regulates malignant melanoma cell viability and chemoresistance via NF‑κB/Bcl‑2 signaling.	Remodeling and spacing factor 1 (Rsf‑1) has been reported as overexpressed in numerous cancers; however, its expression, biological functions and mechanisms in malignant melanoma remain unknown. In the present study, the expression of Rsf‑1 was investigated in 50 cases of malignant melanoma samples using immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that Rsf‑1 expression was elevated in 38% of specimens. MTT, colony formation, Transwell and flow cytometry assays were performed to investigate the functions of Rsf‑1. Knockdown of Rsf‑1 in the MV3 and A375 melanoma cell lines decreased the viability, invasion and cell cycle transition of cells. Conversely, overexpression of Rsf‑1 in M14 cells with low endogenous Rsf‑1 expression induced opposing effects. Further analysis revealed that Rsf‑1 knockdown decreased matrix metalloproteinase‑2, cyclin E and phosphorylated‑IκB expression. Additionally, Rsf‑1 depletion reduced cisplatin resistance and significantly increased the cisplatin‑associated apoptotic rate, whereas Rsf‑1 overexpression exhibited opposing effects. Rsf‑1 also maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential following cisplatin treatment. Analysis of apoptosis‑associated proteins revealed that Rsf‑1 positively regulated B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, and downregulated Bcl‑2‑associated X protein expression. Nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B‑cells (NF‑κB) inhibition reversed the effects of Rsf‑1 on Bcl‑2. In conclusion, Rsf‑1 was overexpressed in malignant melanoma and may contribute to the malignant behaviors of melanoma cells, possibly via the regulation of NF‑κB signaling. Therefore, Rsf‑1 may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of malignant melanoma.	2020	02	04	Mol Med Rep	He	Jiani
31644584	10.1371/journal.pone.0224247	Characteristics of CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma among Koreans: High incidence of BCL2 and MYC double-expressors.	Aberrant expression of CD5 has been reported in 5-10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). CD5+ DLBCL had been recognized as an aggressive immunophenotypic subgroup of DLBCL in the 2008 WHO classification of haematolymphoid neoplasm; however, it was eliminated from the list of subgroups of DLBCLs in the revised 2016 classification. Nevertheless, there is much controversy regarding the clinical significance of CD5 expression, and many researchers still assert that this subgroup exhibits an extremely unfavorable prognosis with frequent treatment failure. We retrospectively investigated 405 DLBCLs recruited from three university hospitals in Korea from 1997 to 2013. The clinical profile, immunophenotype, and chromosomal structural alterations of the BCL2 and MYC genes were compared according to CD5 expression. A total of 29 cases of de novo CD5+ DLBCL were identified out of 405 in our series (7.4%). Clinicopathologic correlation was performed in all 29 CD5+ DLBCLs and 166 CD5- DLBCLs which were eligible for full clinical review and further pathologic examination. Compared with CD5- counterparts, CD5+ DLBCLs showed female preponderance, frequent bone marrow involvement, higher lactate dehydrogenase level, advanced Ann Arbor stages and poorer prognosis (all p&lt;0.05). Pathologically, the expression of CD5 positively correlated with that of BCL2, MYC and Ki-67 (all p&lt;0.05). Coexpression of BCL2 and MYC, which is referred to as a double-expressor, was relatively more common in CD5+ DLBCL, whereas translocation or amplification of these genes was very rare. in conclusion, the expression of CD5 is an independent poor prognostic factor of DLBCLs, and this subgroup displays unique clinicopathologic features. Although the exact mechanism remains uncertain, consistent activation of BCL2 and MYC by alternative pathways other than chromosomal translocation may contribute to the pathogenesis.	2020	03	20	PLoS One	Na	Hee Young

31702637	10.1097/MD.0000000000017827	Immunohistochemical overexpression of BCL-2 protein predicts an inferior survival in patients with primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	This study was designed to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of c-MYC and BCL-2 proteins expression in patients with primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCNS-DLBCL).82 patients newly diagnosed with PCNS-DLBCL, from January 2008 to November 2018, were enrolled in this study. Clinical characteristics, immunohistochemical features, laboratory examinations, and treatment outcome were analyzed among these patients.Among these 82 cases, 45 were males (54.9%) and 37 were females (45.1%). Age ranged from 16 to 78 years old, and 29 patients (35.4%) were elder than 60 years old, with median age at 57 years old. According to Hans classification, 25 were accounted for origin of germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype (30.5%) and 49 were accounted for non-GCB subtype (59.8%), respectively. Eight patients were unclassified due to lack of detailed pathological results. The median survival of these 82 patients was 30 months, and 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 59.7%, 44.6%, and 34.1%, respectively. Patients treated with sequential HD-MTX based chemotherapies showed a superior prognosis than those without. In combination with rituximab, the outcome was further improved. The median OS was 55 months in HD-MTX + R group, 27 months in HD-MTX group, and 9 months in other groups, respectively. Univariate analysis identified age ≥60, ECOG score ≥ 2 points, and overexpression of BCL-2 protein (≥85%) were adverse prognostic factors for OS. Co-expression of c-MYC (≥40%) and BCL-2 (≥50%) proteins was associated with poor ECOG score, high Ki-67 expression, and trended towards an inferior outcome. Gender, lesion location, number of lesions, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), cell of origin, BCL-6 protein expression, expression of c-MYC protein alone and Ki-67 ≥85% had no significant impact on OS.In patients with PCNS-DLBCL, age ≥60 years old, ECOG score ≥2 points, and overexpression of BCL-2 protein (≥85%) were associated with a poor survival. HD-MTX based chemotherapies in combination with rituximab could improve the prognosis.	2019	11	20	Medicine (Baltimore)	Chen	Yi
31737898	10.1042/BSR20191773	MicroRNA-15a modulates lens epithelial cells apoptosis and proliferation through targeting B-cell lymphoma-2 and E2F transcription factor 3 in age-related cataracts.	Age-related cataract remains a serious problem in the aged over the world. MicroRNAs are abnormally expressed in various diseases including age-related cataract. MicroRNA-15a (MicroRNA-15a) has been involved in various diseases and plays crucial roles in many cellular processes. However, the mechanism of microRNA-15a in the genesis of cataract remains barely known. We therefore aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-15a in the cataract. Herein, human lens epithelial B3 cells, HLE-B3 cells were treated with 200 μmol/l H2O2 for 24 h. H2O2 was utilized in our study to induce HLE-B3 cells injury. We observed that cell apoptosis was induced by the treatment of H2O2 and meanwhile, cell proliferation was repressed by 200 μmol/l H2O2. Then, it was found that microRNA-15a was significantly increased with the H2O2 exposure in vitro. Importantly, B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) exert crucial roles in cell apoptosis and cell proliferation. We found that BCL2 and E2F3 were greatly reduced by 200 μmol/l H2O2 in human lens epithelial cells. In addition, microRNA-15a overexpression induced cell apoptosis and repressed cell proliferation through suppressing BCL2 and E2F3. Subsequently, BCL2 and E2F3 were predicted as a direct target of microRNA-15a. The direct correlation between microRNA-15a and BCL2/E2F3 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay. In conclusion, we demonstrated that microRNA-15a triggered apoptosis and repressed the proliferation of HLE-B3 cells by modulating BCL2 and E2F3.	2020	09	25	Biosci Rep	Li	Qiao
31825969	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007485	Alterations of the interactome of Bcl-2 proteins in breast cancer at the transcriptional, mutational and structural level.	Apoptosis is an essential defensive mechanism against tumorigenesis. Proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family regulate programmed cell death by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In response to intracellular stress, the apoptotic balance is governed by interactions of three distinct subgroups of proteins; the activator/sensitizer BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only proteins, the pro-survival, and the pro-apoptotic executioner proteins. Changes in expression levels, stability, and functional impairment of pro-survival proteins can lead to an imbalance in tissue homeostasis. Their overexpression or hyperactivation can result in oncogenic effects. Pro-survival Bcl-2 family members carry out their function by binding the BH3 short linear motif of pro-apoptotic proteins in a modular way, creating a complex network of protein-protein interactions. Their dysfunction enables cancer cells to evade cell death. The critical role of Bcl-2 proteins in homeostasis and tumorigenesis, coupled with mounting insight in their structural properties, make them therapeutic targets of interest. A better understanding of gene expression, mutational profile, and molecular mechanisms of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in different cancer types, could help to clarify their role in cancer development and may guide advancement in drug discovery. Here, we shed light on the pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in breast cancer using different bioinformatic approaches, linking -omics with structural data. We analyzed the changes in the expression of the Bcl-2 proteins and their BH3-containing interactors in breast cancer samples. We then studied, at the structural level, a selection of interactions, accounting for effects induced by mutations found in the breast cancer samples. We find two complexes between the up-regulated Bcl2A1 and two down-regulated BH3-only candidates (i.e., Hrk and Nr4a1) as targets associated with reduced apoptosis in breast cancer samples for future experimental validation. Furthermore, we predict L99R, M75R as damaging mutations altering protein stability, and Y120C as a possible allosteric mutation from an exposed surface to the BH3-binding site.	2020	03	09	PLoS Comput Biol	Kønig	Simon Mathis
28701032	10.4143/crt.2017.134	BCL2 Regulation according to Molecular Subtype of Breast Cancer by Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas Database.	We investigated B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) regulation across DNA, RNA, protein, and methylation status according to molecular subtype of breast cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We analyzed clinical and biological data on 1,096 breast cancers from the TCGA database. Biological data included reverse phase protein array (RPPA), mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq), mRNA microarray, methylation, copy number alteration linear, copy number alteration nonlinear, and mutation data. The luminal A and luminal B subtypes showed upregulated expression of RPPA and mRNAseq and hypomethylation compared to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and triple-negative subtypes (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). No mutations were found in any subjects. High mRNA-seq and high RPPA were strongly associated with positive estrogen receptor, positive progesterone receptor (all p &amp;lt; 0.001), and negative HER2 (p &amp;lt; 0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between protein and mRNA levels and a strong negative correlation between methylation and protein and mRNA levels (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The high BCL2 group showed superior overall survival compared to the low BCL2 group (p=0.006). The regulation of BCL2 was mainly associated with methylation across the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and luminal A and luminal B subtypes showed upregulated expression of BCL2 protein, mRNA, and hypomethylation. Although copy number alteration may have played a minor role, mutation status was not related to BCL2 regulation. Upregulation of BCL2 was associated with superior prognosis than downregulation of BCL2.	2018	10	25	Cancer Res Treat	Hwang	Ki-Tae
28718205	10.1002/cyto.b.21541	Bcl-2 maturation pattern in T-cells distinguishes thymic neoplasm/hyperplasia, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and reactive lymph nodes.	Anterior mediastinal biopsies consisting predominantly of small lymphocytes can be a diagnostic challenge, especially in small core biopsies. In these cases, immunophenotyping is often employed using flow cytometry, and/or immunohistochemistry. However, due the overlap in T-cell phenotype between thymic neoplasm/hyperplasia (THY), T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), and reactive lymph nodes (RLN), biopsies consisting predominantly of T-cells may still be difficult to differentiate. Previous studies have shown a specific CD3/bcl-2 staining pattern in thymic T cells of humans and mice using flow cytometry. However, the utility of this finding in distinguishing T-cells of THY, T-LBL, and RLN has not been carefully evaluated. Our findings show that the pattern of CD3/bcl-2 expression in thymic T-cells can be used to help diagnose anterior mediastinal biopsies, even when limited specimen is provided. © 2017 International Clinical Cytometry Society.	2019	05	08	Cytometry B Clin Cytom	Ward	Nicholas
28777433	10.5301/ijbm.5000291	Apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 is an independent prognostic marker for worse overall survival in triple-negative breast cancer patients.	The objective of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an endogenous marker for tumor hypoxia; the cellular tumor antigen p53; and the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Immunohistochemically determined expression of CAIX, p53, Bcl-2 and proliferation factor Ki-67, analyzed in 64 paraffin-embedded TNBC tissue samples, was used to assess their relation to clinicopathological variables and prognostic implications for overall survival (OS). Bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with histological grade of tumor, while expression of p53 was positively correlated with the same clinical variable (p = 0.036 and p = 0.033, respectively). The p53 expression was also positively correlated with tumor size (p = 0.010). Survival analysis showed that patients with high Bcl-2 expression (above cutoff value determined by receiver operator characteristic [ROC] curve analysis) had shorter OS (p = 0.020). The same was observed for patients with tumors larger than 5 cm (p = 0.034) or positive lymph nodes (p = 0.004). Among all 3 examined markers, multivariate analysis showed that only Bcl-2 expression was a strong independent prognostic indicator for decreased OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 15.16, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.881-79.727, p = 0.001). Elevated expression of Bcl-2 was an independent prognostic factor for poorer OS in TNBC and as such a significant marker for tumor aggressiveness.	2018	08	31	Int J Biol Markers	Ozretic	Petar
28805013	10.1002/mabi.201700196	Drug-Free Macromolecular Therapeutics Induce Apoptosis via Calcium Influx and Mitochondrial Signaling Pathway.	Recently, an innovative paradigm has been proposed in macromolecular therapeutics for treatment of B-cell lymphomas that can specifically kill cancer cells without a drug. The design rationale of this drug-free macromolecular therapeutic (DFMT) system is crosslinking the cell surface receptor to initiate apoptosis. However, how the apoptosis signal is triggered after receptor hyper-crosslinking remains to be elucidated. Here, two pathways, calcium influx dependent pathway and mitochondrial signal pathway, are identified to play major roles in triggering the programmed cell death. With the first step pretargeting and second step multiple binding, receptor hyper-crosslinking is achieved in a highly specific, time-dependent manner and largely mediated by multivalence. As a consequence, extracellular calcium influx is triggered, which subsequently decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential and induces apoptosis. The mitochondrial depolarization also stems from the Bcl-2 inhibition mediated by DFMT, followed by the cytochrome c release that activates caspase signaling. With the participation of the two-pronged mechanism, a programmed apoptosis is induced in response to DFMT treatment. The current findings can offer important implications to optimize the anti-CD20 strategies to treat B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.	2018	12	21	Macromol Biosci	Li	Lian
28824170	10.1038/leu.2017.270	Differences between BCL2-break positive and negative follicular lymphoma unraveled by whole-exome sequencing.	Depending on disease stage follicular lymphoma (FL) lack the t(14;18) in ~15-~50% of cases. Nevertheless, most of these cases express BCL2. To elucidate mechanisms triggering BCL2 expression and promoting pathogenesis in t(14;18)-negative FL, exonic single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles of 28 t(14;18)-positive and 13 t(14;18)-negative FL were analyzed, followed by the integration of copy-number changes, copy-neutral LOH and published gene-expression data as well as the assessment of immunoglobulin N-glycosylation sites. Typical FL mutations also affected t(14;18)-negative FL. Curated gene set/pathway annotation of genes mutated in either t(14;18)-positive or t(14;18)-negative FL revealed a strong enrichment of same or similar gene sets but also a more prominent or exclusive enrichment of immune response and N-glycosylation signatures in t(14;18)-negative FL. Mutated genes showed high BCL2 association in both subgroups. Among the genes mutated in t(14;18)-negative FL 555 were affected by copy-number alterations and/or copy-neutral LOH and 96 were differently expressed between t(14;18)-positive and t(14;18)-negative FL (P&lt;0.01). N-glycosylation sites were detected considerably less frequently in t(14;18)-negative FL. These results suggest a diverse portfolio of genetic alterations that may induce or regulate BCL2 expression or promote pathogenesis of t(14;18)-negative FL as well as a less specific but increased crosstalk with the microenvironment that may compensate for the lack of N-glycosylation.	2019	02	08	Leukemia	Zamò	A

28914671	10.1097/PGP.0000000000000442	Endometrial Polyps and Benign Endometrial Hyperplasia Have Increased Prevalence of DNA Fragmentation Factors 40 and 45 (DFF40 and DFF45) Together With the Antiapoptotic B-Cell Lymphoma (Bcl-2) Protein Compared With Normal Human Endometria.	DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) is a key executor of apoptosis. It localizes to the nucleus together with DNA fragmentation factor 45 (DFF45), which acts as a DFF40 inhibitor and chaperone. B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2) protein is a proven antiapoptotic factor present in the cytoplasm. In this study, we aimed to investigate DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2 immunoexpression in endometrial polyps (EPs) and benign endometrial hyperplasia (BEH) tissue compared with that in normal proliferative endometrium (NPE) and normal secretory endometrium (NSE) as well as normal post menopausal endometrium (NAE). This study used archived samples from 65 and 62 cases of EPs and BEH, respectively. The control group consisted of 52 NPE, 54 NSE, and 54 NAE specimens. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2. DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2 were more highly expressed in the glandular layer of EPs and BEH compared with the stroma, and this was not influenced by menopausal status. Both glandular and stromal expression of DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2 were significantly higher in EPs compared with NPE, NSE, and NAE. Glandular BEH tissue showed significantly higher DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2 expression than in NPE, NSE, and NAE. No differences in the glandular expression of DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2 were observed between EP and BEH tissues, while Bcl-2 stromal expression in BEH was significantly lower than in EPs. Glandular, menopause-independent DFF40, DFF45, and Bcl-2 overexpression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of EPs and BEH.	2018	12	11	Int J Gynecol Pathol	Banas	Tomasz
29131545	10.1111/febs.14324	A double point mutation at residues Ile14 and Val15 of Bcl-2 uncovers a role for the BH4 domain in both protein stability and function.	B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein is the archetype apoptosis suppressor protein. The N-terminal Bcl-2-homology 4 (BH4) domain of Bcl-2 is required for the antiapoptotic function of this protein at the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The involvement of the BH4 domain in Bcl-2's antiapoptotic functions has been proposed based on Gly-based substitutions of the Ile14/Val15 amino acids, two hydrophobic residues located in the center of Bcl-2's BH4 domain. Following this strategy, we recently showed that a BH4-domain-derived peptide in which Ile14 and Val15 have been replaced by Gly residues, was unable to dampen proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> -release events from the ER. Here, we investigated the impact of these mutations on the overall structure, stability, and function of full-length Bcl-2 as a regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and cell death. Our results indicate that full-length Bcl-2 Ile14Gly/Val15Gly, in contrast to wild-type Bcl-2, (a) displayed severely reduced structural stability and a shortened protein half-life; (b) failed to interact with Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), to inhibit the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub> R) and to protect against Ca<sup>2+</sup> -mediated apoptosis. We conclude that the hydrophobic face of Bcl-2's BH4 domain (Ile14, Val15) is an important structural regulatory element by affecting protein stability and turnover, thereby likely reducing Bcl-2's ability to modulate the function of its targets, like IP<sub>3</sub> R and BAX. Therefore, Bcl-2 structure/function studies require pre-emptive and reliable determination of protein stability upon introduction of point mutations at the level of the BH4 domain.	2018	10	29	FEBS J	Monaco	Giovanni
29207009	10.3892/ijmm.2017.3260	TAT‑fused IP3R‑derived peptide enhances cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells by increasing ER Ca2+ release.	Ovarian cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy. At present, cisplatin is used to treat ovarian cancer; however, the development of cisplatin resistance during therapy is a common obstacle to achieving favorable outcomes. Recently, the B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) BH4 domain has been reported to mediate the prosurvival activity of Bcl‑2 in cancer; however, the involvement of the BH4 domain of Bcl‑2 in the cisplatin resistance of ovarian carcinoma cells is not entirely clear. In this study, we observed the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial levels of Ca2+ by confocal laser microscopy. We also detected cell apoptosis using western blot analysis and flow cytometry. The present study demonstrated that TAT‑fused inositol 1,4,5‑trisphosphate receptor‑derived peptide (TAT‑IDPS), which targets the BH4 domain of Bcl‑2, increased cisplatin‑induced Ca2+ flux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol and mitochondria. In addition, TAT‑IDPS increased cisplatin‑induced expression of mitochondrial apoptosis‑associated proteins and ER stress‑associated proteins. These results indicated that TAT‑IDPS may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin toward ovarian carcinoma cells by increasing ER Ca2+ release.	2018	07	17	Int J Mol Med	Xie	Qi
29246583	10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.12.003	DNA structural basis for fragility at peak III of BCL2 major breakpoint region associated with t(14;18) translocation.	Maintaining genome integrity is crucial for normal cellular functions. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), when unrepaired, can potentiate chromosomal translocations. t(14;18) translocation involving BCL2 gene on chromosome 18 and IgH loci at chromosome 14, could lead to follicular lymphoma. Molecular basis for fragility of translocation breakpoint regions is an active area of investigation. Previously, formation of non-B DNA structures like G-quadruplex, triplex, B/A transition were investigated at peak I of BCL2 major breakpoint region (MBR); however, it is less understood at peak III. In vitro gel shift assays show faster mobility for MBR peak III sequences, unlike controls. CD studies of peak III sequences reveal a spectral pattern different from B-DNA. Although complementary C-rich stretches exhibit single-strandedness, corresponding guanine-rich sequences do not show DMS protection, ruling out G-quadruplex and triplex DNA. Extrachromosomal assay indicates that peak III halts transcription, unlike its mutated version. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence suggest formation of potential cruciform DNA structure at MBR peak III, which was also supported by in silico studies. Thus, our study reveals formation of non-B DNA structure which could be a basis for fragility at BCL2 breakpoint regions, eventually leading to chromosomal translocations.	2018	05	22	Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj	Javadekar	Saniya M
29328455	10.3892/mmr.2018.8381	Role of miR-21 in the growth and metastasis of human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.	Aberrant microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression has been reported in various cancer types. miR‑21, which is considered to be a proto-oncogene and is frequently overexpressed in certain cancer types, has been implicated in tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of miR‑21 degradation on tumor progression and its potential mechanisms in human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) development. Results of reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that SACC cells with high metastatic potential (SACC‑LM cells) exhibited a significantly higher expression of miR‑21 compared with SACC cells with a lower metastatic potential (SACC‑83 cells). In addition, following transfection of SACC‑LM cells with miR‑21 inhibitor, cell viability was reduced, which may be a result of reduced cell proliferation and metastasis, and the induction of apoptosis, as determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8, wound healing, Matrigel invasion and flow cytometry assays. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis indicated that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and B‑cell lymphoma (Bcl)‑2 are potential target genes of miR‑21. Therefore, western blotting was performed to investigate the expression of these proteins, and the results demonstrated that miR‑21 expression level was negatively associated with PDCD4 and PTEN protein expression, and positively associated with Bcl‑2 protein expression, in SACC‑LM cells, indicating that miR‑21 may promote SACC progression via PDCD4, PTEN and Bcl‑2. In conclusion, the present study indicates that miR‑21 may be a novel target for SACC therapy and provide a novel basis for the clinical treatment of SACC.	2018	08	16	Mol Med Rep	Yan	Fei
29422088	10.1186/s13195-018-0344-4	Associations of Bcl-2 rs956572 genotype groups in the structural covariance network in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, and genetic differences may mediate neuronal degeneration. In humans, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) gene, rs956572, has been found to significantly modulate Bcl-2 protein expression in the brain. The Bcl-2 AA genotype has been associated with reduced Bcl-2 levels and lower gray matter volume in healthy populations. We hypothesized that different Bcl-2 genotype groups may modulate large-scale brain networks that determine neurobehavioral test scores. Gray matter structural covariance networks (SCNs) were constructed in 104 patients with AD using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with seed-based correlation analysis. The patients were stratified into two genotype groups on the basis of Bcl-2 expression (G carriers, n = 76; A homozygotes, n = 28). Four SCNs characteristic of AD were constructed from seeds in the default mode network, salience network, and executive control network, and cognitive test scores served as the major outcome factor. For the G carriers, influences of the SCNs were observed mostly in the default mode network, of which the peak clusters anchored by the posterior cingulate cortex seed determined the cognitive test scores. In contrast, genetic influences in the A homozygotes were found mainly in the executive control network, and both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seed and the interconnected peak clusters were correlated with the clinical scores. Despite a small number of cases, the A homozygotes showed greater covariance strength than the G carriers among all four SCNs. Our results suggest that the Bcl-2 rs956572 polymorphism is associated with different strengths of structural covariance in AD that determine clinical outcomes. The greater covariance strength in the four SCNs shown in the A homozygotes suggests that different Bcl-2 polymorphisms play different modulatory roles.	2019	09	16	Alzheimers Res Ther	Chang	Chiung-Chih
29484432	10.3892/ijo.2018.4285	miR‑15a represses cancer cell migration and invasion under conditions of hypoxia by targeting and downregulating Bcl‑2 expression in human osteosarcoma cells.	Osteosarcoma is a common, high-risk primary bone malignancy that mostly affects the younger population. There has been no marked improvement in the clinical outcomes of osteosarcoma patients to date, and cancer recurrence and metastasis are common in high-grade osteosarcoma. Therefore, identifying new biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets is crucial for improving the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. In the present study, the MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line was employed to examine the role of microRNA (miR)‑15a in regulating cellular activities under hypoxic conditions. It was demonstrated that hypoxia stimulates migration and invasion in MG63 cells, which was correlated with the downregulation of miR‑15a and upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) expression. Introduction of miR‑15a or knockdown of endogenous Bcl‑2 may reduce hypoxia-induced cell invasion and migration through the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases. Analysis of the expression of miR‑15a indicated that hypoxia repressed the transcription of deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2 (DLEU2), which is the host gene of miR‑15a. These findings indicated that miR‑15a may be a valuable target for the treatment of osteosarcoma, particularly for patients with high-grade cancer or heavy tumor burden.	2018	08	23	Int J Oncol	Leng	Jiali
29666157	10.1136/jclinpath-2018-205039	CD30 expression and its correlation with MYC and BCL2 in de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	CD30+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has emerged as a new immunophenotypic variant of <i>de novo</i> DLBCLs. However, the prevalence of CD30 positivity is variable according to different studies, and the prognostic significance of CD30 is also controversial. This study aimed to investigate the positive expression rate and prognostic impact of CD30 in <i>de novo</i> DLBCLs and try to find the correlated influences. A total of 241 patients with <i>de novo</i> DLBCL in east China from 2008 to 2015 were included to investigate the prevalence, clinicopathological features and outcomes of CD30+ <i>de novo</i> DLBCLs. Immunohistochemical evaluation for CD10, CD30, BCL2, BCL6, MUM1/IRF4, MYC and Ki67, and fluorescence in situ hybridisation for MYC and BCL2 gene alterations were performed. Using a &gt;0% threshold, CD30 expression was detected in approximately 10% patient with <i>de novo</i> DLBCL. These predominately presented with centroblastic or anaplastic morphological patterns, less frequently showing immunoblastic morphology or 'starry sky' pattern, mutually exclusive with MYC gene rearrangement, and negatively associated with BCL2 protein expression. CD30 expression was associated with a favourable prognosis of patients' outcomes. However, the multivariate analysis revealed that it was not an independent prognostic factor in <i>de novo</i> DLBCLs. The impact of CD30 might be influenced by the international prognostic index and the expression of MYC and BCL2 proteins. CD30+ DLBCL may be a subset of <i>de novo</i> DLBCLs with characteristic clinicopathological features, but the prognostic role of CD30 is limited.	2018	08	27	J Clin Pathol	Gong	Qi-Xing
29669301	10.1016/j.biopha.2018.04.002	LIN28B promotes the progression of colon cancer by increasing B-cell lymphoma 2 expression.	RNA-binding protein LIN28B is frequently overexpressed in human colon cancer and is associated with the tumor progression and poor prognosis. The potential molecular mechanisms underlying the role of LIN28B in colon cancer remain unclear. The present study aimed to explore the role of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) in promoting colon cancer development associated with LIN28B. The expression pattern of LIN28B in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by RT-PCR, Western blotting analysis, and immunohistochemical staining. A log rank test was carried out to compare the survival times of patients with high/low levels of LIN28B. The effects of LIN28B on cell clonal formation, growth, and apoptosis were detected by clone formation, MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. BCL-2 expression and protein stability after LIN28B up-regulation were assessed by Western blotting. The effects of LIN28B and BCL-2 on tumorigenesis were evaluated by an in vivo xenograft assay. The results showed that LIN28B was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cell lines, which could promote cell clonal formation and growth and inhibit cell apoptosis. Up-regulation of LIN28B increased BCL-2 expression, enhanced its stability, and reduced its ubiquitination. Overexpression of LIN28B promoted cell tumorigenesis, whereas this effect was repressed by knockdown of BCL-2. This study suggests that overexpression of LIN28B promotes colon cancer development by increasing BCL-2 expression, potentially opening up new avenues for therapeutic approaches to colon cancer treatment.	2018	10	08	Biomed Pharmacother	Yuan	Leilei
29680307	10.1016/j.arcmed.2018.04.006	Prognostic Value of CD95, Active Caspase-3, and Bcl-2 Expression in Adult Patients with De Novo Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is an aggressive malignant disease with high mortality rates in adults. The expression levels of CD95, active caspase-3, and Bcl-2 were determined in 111 patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The immunophenotyped ok leukemia and the expression of CD95, active caspase-3, and Bcl-2, were determined by flow cytometry. Apoptotic variables were correlated by Spearman test, and survival by Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to compare survival curves. From a total of 111 patients, 56 cases were B-ALL, 16 T-ALL, 16 B-ALL/CD33<sup>+</sup>, and 23 ambiguous lineage-AL (AmbLin-AL). The median expression of CD95 (61.5%) and active-caspase-3 (19.4%) was higher in T-ALL (p &lt;0.05), whereas Bcl-2 was lower in T-ALL (p &lt;0.038). There was a highly significant correlation in B-ALL, B-ALL/CD33<sup>+</sup> and AmbLin-AL between CD95 and Bcl-2, CD95-Active caspase-3, and Bcl-2-Active caspase-3; while in T-ALL, there was only a correlation between CD95-Active caspase-3, and Bcl-2-Active caspase-3. OS and DFS were better for T-ALL than the other groups, especially in patients having higher values of CD95 and active caspase 3, and lower values of Bcl-2. The worse survival rates were observed in patients with B-ALL/CD33<sup>+</sup>, and AmbLin-AL. The prognosis of ALL in adults is influenced by the expression levels of Bcl-2, active-caspase-3, and CD95.	2019	08	08	Arch Med Res	Montiel-Cervantes	Laura Arcelia
29708579	10.5146/tjpath.2018.01430	Evaluation of the Prognostic Importance of c-Myc and Bcl-2 Expressions and the Presence of Epstein-Barr Virus in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.	Although classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) has a relatively good prognosis, it also entails different treatment responses and involves patients who have different clinical courses. Our aim was to investigate c-Myc, Bcl-2 and EBV biomarkers in cHL and their relationship with the IPS score. c-Myc and Bcl-2 immunohistochemical staining with EBER in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) was applied to the paraffin sections of 94 cases diagnosed as cHL. These cases were classified into two groups as low and high clinical symptoms according to the International Prognostic Scores (IPS). Positive results were obtained in 83 (88.3%) cases with c-Myc and 39 (43.5%) cases with Bcl-2 while EBER-ISH was found positive in 42 (44.7%) cases. No difference was found between the groups of low/high IP scores with respect to the positive or negative results of EBER-ISH, Bcl-2 and c-Myc. When Bcl-2 and c-Myc positive cases were grouped together and compared to the IP scores of the remaining cHL cases, again no difference was seen. Extranodal involvement and bone marrow involvement was observed in 25 (26.5%) and 9 (9.5%) cases, respectively. Similarly, no statistically significant differences was found between these groups according to their positivity with EBER-ISH, Bcl-2 and c-Myc. We could not find any relationship between Bcl-2, c-Myc and EBER-ISH positivity and the low/high IPS groups in cHL. New studies with larger series are needed in which more precise cut-off values are used and clinically and biologically heterogeneous groups of cHL patients are determined more clearly.	2018	12	11	Turk Patoloji Derg	Kiliçarslan	Aydan
29747654	10.1186/s13045-018-0608-2	BCL-2 as therapeutic target for hematological malignancies.	Disruption of the physiologic balance between cell proliferation and cell death is an important step of cancer development. Increased resistance to apoptosis is a key oncogenic mechanism in several hematological malignancies and, in many cases, especially in lymphoid neoplasias, has been attributed to the upregulation of BCL-2. The BCL-2 protein is the founding member of the BCL-2 family of apoptosis regulators and was the first apoptosis modulator to be associated with cancer. The recognition of the important role played by BCL-2 for cancer development and resistance to treatment made it a relevant target for therapy for many diseases, including solid tumors and hematological neoplasias. Among the different strategies that have been developed to inhibit BCL-2, BH3-mimetics have emerged as a novel class of compounds with favorable results in different clinical settings, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In April 2016, the first inhibitor of BCL-2, venetoclax, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with CLL who have 17p deletion and had received at least one prior therapy. This review focuses on the relevance of BCL-2 for apoptosis modulation at the mitochondrial level, its potential as therapeutic target for hematological malignancies, and the results obtained with selective inhibitors belonging to the BH3-mimetics, especially venetoclax used in monotherapy or in combination with other agents.	2019	10	25	J Hematol Oncol	Perini	Guilherme Fleury
29801406	10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1229	Impact of Double Expression of C-MYC/BCL2 Protein and Cell of Origin Subtypes on the Outcome among Patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: a Single Asian Center Experience	Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with double expression of c-MYC and BCL2 protein isassociated with dismal outcome after treatment with R-CHOP. Local data on disease burden and survival outcome inDLBCL is limited. We investigated the prognostic values of c-MYC/BCL2 protein co-expression and cell of originsubtypes using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to determine their associations with multiethnic groups underresource limited setting. Methods: This was a retrospective study which recruited 104 patients in between June 2012and December 2015 for IHC review and analysis. Result: We demonstrated that patients with high InternationalPrognostic Index (IPI) (score 3-5) and co-expression of c-MYC/BCL2 protein had significant inferior overall survival(OS) and event free survival (EFS) respectively (P&lt;0.05). c-MYC/BCL2 protein co-expression was more common innon-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) (P=0.048) and contributed to adverse prognosis in this group of patients (OS,P=0.004; EFS, P=0.005). In multivariate analysis, double-protein co-expression was a significant independent predictorof inferior outcome after adjusted for IPI and cell of origin subtypes (OS hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.04;P=0.048; EFS HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.04; P=0.036). In addition, non-GCB subtype was more common than GCBin Malays (60% vs 40%, P=0.106) and Chinese (81.2% vs 18.8%, P=0.042). Indians had more DLBCL without c-MYC/BCL2 protein co-expression compared to double-protein positive cases (66.7% vs 33.3%, P=0.414). Otherwise, theprognostic impact of ethnicity on survival outcome was insignificant (P=0.961). Conclusion: c-MYC/BCL2 proteinco-expression in non-GCB subtype constituted a unique group with extremely inferior outcome regardless of ethnicity.Gene expression profile (GEP) may possibly provide insights into the cause of discrepancies in DLBCL subtypes andprotein expression among the multiethnic groups.	2018	10	17	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Teoh	Ching Soon
29902576	10.1016/j.humpath.2018.06.006	Lymphomas with pseudo-double-hit BCL6-MYC translocations due to t(3;8)(q27;q24) are associated with a germinal center immunophenotype, extranodal involvement, and frequent BCL2 translocations.	High-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements, ""double-hit"" or ""triple-hit"" lymphomas (DTHL), are aggressive neoplasms associated with a poor prognosis. A t(3;8)(q27;q24) rarely occurs in B-cell lymphomas that results in a unique ""pseudo-double-hit"" BCL6-MYC fusion, indistinguishable by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) from more conventional DTHL with independent MYC and BCL6 translocations. Reports of t(3;8)(q27;q24) lymphomas are sparse, and to better characterize their pathologic, cytogenetic, and clinical features, 6 new cases from 2 institutions and 19 previously published cases were reviewed. All new cases displayed aggressive morphologic features, and most previously published cases were classified as aggressive lymphomas. Collectively, all t(3;8)(q27;q24) cases had a germinal center (GC) phenotype, and most had complex karyotypes (22/24, 92%), including frequent concomitant BCL2 rearrangements (17/24, 71%). When compared to two large published DTHL cohorts, t(3;8)(q27;q24) lymphomas less often expressed BCL2 (P &lt; .01), had a greater likelihood of extranodal involvement (P &lt; .01), and more frequently appeared triple-hit by FISH analysis (P &lt; .01). Despite presenting with aggressive clinicopathologic features, 100% (6/6) of t(3;8;)(q27;q24) patients achieved complete remission after intensive induction regimens, and 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 63% (10/16) and 57% (8/14), respectively. These findings suggest that lymphomas with t(3;8)(q27;q24) may represent a subset of GC B-cell lymphomas distinct from conventional DTHL. Our results further highlight the value of routine karyotype assessment in aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and the importance of recognizing the t(3;8)(q27;q24) so that its clinical significance can be more fully explored.	2019	05	16	Hum Pathol	Johnson	Steven M
29983382	10.1016/j.clml.2018.06.010	Prognostic Significance of BCL-2 and BCL-6 Expression in MYC-positive DLBCL.	Double-expression lymphoma (DEL) is a rare subgroup of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which has coexpression of MYC and BCL-2. Coexpression of MYC and BCL-2 is considered a prognostic marker portending poor outcomes. However, the prognostic effect of BCL-2 and BCL-6 expression in DLBCL remains controversial. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect MYC, BCL-2 and BCL-6 expression in 212 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and assess the prognostic effects of BCL-2 and BCL-6 expression. The DLBCL patients were treated with R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], prednisone)-like regimens. Retrospective analysis revealed that BCL-2<sup>+</sup> and BCL-2<sup>+</sup>/MYC<sup>+</sup> were prognostic factors indicative of poor outcomes. Patients with BCL-2<sup>+</sup> and/or MYC<sup>+</sup> expression had a poorer prognosis than that of patients with BCL-2<sup>-</sup> and/or MYC<sup>-</sup> expression. Patients with BCL-2<sup>+</sup>/MYC<sup>-</sup> expression showed a trend toward poorer survival than those with BCL-2<sup>-</sup>/MYC<sup>+</sup> expression, suggesting that BCL-2 plays a more important role than MYC. Also, patients with BCL-6<sup>-</sup>/MYC<sup>+</sup> expression had poorer progression-free survival than those with BCL-6<sup>+</sup>/MYC<sup>+</sup> expression. In addition, patients with BCL-2<sup>+</sup>/MYC<sup>+</sup>/BCL-6<sup>-</sup> expression had the worst prognosis, suggesting that BCL-6<sup>-</sup> is a prognostic factor for poor outcomes for MYC<sup>+</sup> DLBCL patients. Altogether, our findings have shown that BCL-2 is an independent prognostic factor and possibly plays a more important role than MYC in MYC<sup>+</sup> DLBCL patients. Furthermore, we found that BCL-6<sup>-</sup> expression could also be a prognostic factor portending poor outcomes for MYC<sup>+</sup> DLBCL patients.	2019	10	21	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Li	Linyu
30015962	10.3892/or.2018.6581	Knockdown of metadherin inhibits cell proliferation and migration in colorectal cancer.	Metadherin (MTDH) is a multifunctional oncogene involved in tumor cell migration and metastasis through regulating a number of oncogenic signaling pathways in various human malignancies. Previous studies have demonstrated that MTDH is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and associated with cancer progression and a poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The present study investigated the expression and role of MTDH in CRC cells as well as the underlying mechanism of this. Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were conducted to determine protein and mRNA expression of MTDH in three human CRC cell lines. A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MTDH was introduced into CRC HCT116 cells to stably inhibit MTDH expression. A Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of MTDH‑knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Western blotting was performed to examine the protein expression levels of cell growth‑ and apoptosis‑associated genes. The results demonstrated that MTDH was commonly expressed in CRC cell lines. MTDH silencing significantly suppressed cell growth, colony forming ability and migration while inducing the apoptosis of HCT116 cells. In addition, MTDH depletion induced S phase cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of MTDH markedly downregulated the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B, c‑Myc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) protein in HCT116 cells, and the expression of p53 and Bcl‑2‑associated X protein was significantly increased compared with the negative control shRNA group (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that MTDH may function through the expression of numerous types of apoptosis‑associated and signaling channel proteins in CRC cells. Taken together, these data indicated that MTDH may serve as a biomarker and candidate therapeutic target for CRC.	2018	11	20	Oncol Rep	Li	Jian-Wang
30043475	10.1002/dc.24038	""Triple hit"" lymphomas: A retrospective cytology case series of an uncommon high grade B-cell malignancy with C-MYC, BCL-2 and BCL-6 rearrangements.	The Revised fourth Edition World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues suggests novel categories, including ""high grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and BCL6 gene rearrangements."" These diseases are known colloquially as ""double hit"" and ""triple hit"" lymphomas. The ""first-hit"" in these cases is the harboring of a MYC rearrangement. Concurrent derangements of BCL2 and BCL6 can be the ""second-hit"" or ""third-hit."" To our knowledge, this is the first report of ""triple-hit"" lymphomas in cytology specimens. The files of the Cleveland Clinic (January 2007 through December 2017) were searched for all ""triple hit"" lymphomas. Four cases met inclusion criteria (cytology slides in files and histologically confirmed ""triple hit"" lymphoma). All slides were reviewed. The mean age was 65 years, with a male predominance. All patients presented at advanced stage and showed progressive disease despite therapy. FISH studies (histologic sections) confirmed translocations of MYC (8q24), BCL2 (18q21) and BCL6 (3q27) in all patients. All cases were characterized by high cellularity, dispersed cells, presence of stripped nuclei, lymphoglandular bodies, apoptotic bodies, cytomegaly, nucleomegaly, nuclear envelope irregularities, macronucleoli (most often single), recognizable mitoses and presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles (variable). The WHO recommends that all large B-cell lymphomas be investigated using cytogenetic or molecular techniques. Concurrent inhibition of MYC and BCL2 is a potentially effective treatment strategy for triple hit lymphomas, and an expanding literature exists regarding predictive biomarkers and therapeutic regimens. It is our intention to raise awareness of this uncommon mature B-cell neoplasm within the cytodiagnostic community.	2018	11	26	Diagn Cytopathol	Eldessouki	Tarek
30058688	10.26355/eurrev_201807_15502	Expressions and effects of G250, Bax and Bcl-2 in rats with renal clear cell carcinoma.	To investigate the expressions and effects of G250, B-cell lymphoma-2 associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 in rats with renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC). A total of 66 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were selected, among which 56 were selected to establish RCCC rat model and the remaining 10 were selected as control group. Three weeks after modeling, 4 rats failed in the modeling. Expressions of G250 in RCCC rat model group and healthy rat model control group were detected by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR); expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax in each group were detected by Western blot and their effects were analyzed. The positive expression rates of G250 in 52 RCCC rats in model group and 10 healthy rats in control group were 83.3% and 0%, respectively. The results showed that expression of G250 had a certain correlation with the pathological changes of RCCC (p &lt; 0.01). Expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 were up-regulated in the RCCC group, while expressions were down-regulated in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.05). G250, as a new specific marker of renal cell carcinoma, is involved in the pathological changes of renal cell carcinoma. Joint detection of Bax and Bcl-2 can be used as an important index for the diagnosis of RCCC.	2019	12	13	Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci	Wang	Y-Q
30152851	10.3892/mmr.2018.9428	Estrogen restricts the apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells by promoting TSLP secretion.	Endometriosis (EMS) is a female hormone‑ dependent disease with controversial reports of its etiology and pathogenesis. Apoptosis is particularly important in the human endometrium due to the dynamic cycles of proliferation and shedding. Estrogen possessed antiapoptotic effects on endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), which appears to be exacerbated in women with EMS; however, the underlying mechanism of the antiapoptotic effects of estrogen on ESC remains unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether estrogen regulates the apoptosis of ESCs via thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and the associated mechanism. An ELISA was conducted to detect TSLP content in the ESC culture medium treated with estrogen. Subsequently, the early apoptotic rate and expression of B‑cell lymphoma (Bcl‑2) of ESCs were analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence of recombinant human TSLP, anti‑human TSLP neutralizing antibody or estrogen. In the present study, it was reported that ESCs exhibited basal TSLP secretion in the absence of estrogen as reported in previous studies, and that estrogen promoted TSLP secretion of ESCs in a dose‑dependent manner. The results demonstrated that estrogen suppressed the apoptosis of ESCs associated with the promotion of Bcl‑2 expression, which may be partly reversed by inhibiting TSLP. Therefore, the findings of the present study revealed a novel mechanism of estrogen‑dependent apoptotic suppression of ESCs associated with TSLP secretion and Bcl‑2 regulation. Endogenous and estrogen‑induced endometrial TSLP may promote the initiation and development of EMS via the inhibition of apoptosis.	2019	01	25	Mol Med Rep	Yang	Hui-Li
