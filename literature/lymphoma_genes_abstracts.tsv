35255429	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2021.151886	De Novo CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A genomic profiling study and prognostic analysis of 46 patients.	We reported 46 cases of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma which abnormally expressed CD5 protein (De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL), which had attracted researcher's attention for a period of time for its poor prognosis. However, there were few studies on its molecular change. In the present article, we summarized the genetic alterations using a lymphopanel detection method by Next Generation Sequencing(NGS). The most frequently mutated genes were MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> (20/46, 43.5%), followed by PIMI (19/46, 41.3%), IGLL5 (13/46, 28.3%)and CD79B (11/46, 23.9%). We further investigated the relationship between gene alterations and prognosis using OS(Overall survival) and PFS(Progression-free survival). MYD88, CREBBP, and ACTB mutation were significantly associated with inferior OS (P = 0.032, 0.000, 0.001), PIMI, CREBBP, ACTB and CXCR4 mutation were significantly associated with inferior PFS (P = 0.016, 0.001, 0.045, 0.024). Meanwhile, we found that De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL had BCL-6(9/46,19.6%), C-MYC (4/46, 8.7%) and IRF4 (2/19, 10.5%) rearrangement, but without BCL-2 rearrangement, there were no significantly associations with prognosis. In summary, our research explored the gene alterations of De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL in a relatively large scale for the first time, the most common gene mutation was MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> which was also a potential prognostic factor, providing a potential therapeutic target for the patients of De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL.	2022	05	23	Ann Diagn Pathol	Fan	Yue
35344115	10.1007/s11033-022-07337-w	Identification and validation of suitable housekeeping genes for gene expression studies in BCR-ABL1 positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The stability of the housekeeping gene (HKG) expression is an absolute prerequisite for accurate normalization of target gene expression in a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). In RQ-PCR, the widely used normalization approach involves the standardization of target genes to the most stable HKG control genes. According to the recent literature, in different experimental conditions the HKGs exhibit either up or down-regulation and thus affecting the gene expression profiles of target genes which leads to erroneous results. This implies that it is very important to select the appropriate HKG and verify the expression stability of the HKG before quantification of the target gene. The present study aims to analyze six different HKGs for their expression profiles and stability in BCR-ABL1 negative cases and validate them in BCR-ABL1 positive cases, detected by multiplex reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Six commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ABL1, RNA18S, ACTB, GUSB, and EEF2) were selected in this study. RQ-PCR was performed on 24 BCR-ABL1 negative cases and the outcomes were validated on 24 BCR-ABL1 positive cases. RefFinder™, a web-based composite software was used to check the stability of HKG genes by different algorithms and comprehensive ranking of each HKG gene in BCR-ABL1 negative cases and finally validated in BCR-ABL1 positive cases. It was found that RNA18S, ABL1 and GUSB are good stable HKG genes, which showed minimum variability in gene expression compared to GAPDH, EEF2, and ACTB, the most commonly used HKG.	2022	07	12	Mol Biol Rep	Gupta	Dikshat Gopal
35765478	10.14202/vetworld.2022.1333-1340	Investigation of proteomic profiles in canine lymphoma using tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics approach.	Specific tumor biomarkers are useful for the early diagnosis of cancer or can predict the recurrence of neoplastic disease in humans and animals. Lymphoma in dogs could be classified into B-, T-, and NK-cell origins. T-cell lymphoma has the worst prognosis with a shorter survival time and disease-free interval. This study aimed to identify the differential serum protein expressions of canine B- and T-cell lymphomas compared with healthy dogs using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Serum samples were collected from 20 untreated canine lymphomas (14 B-cells and 6 T-cells) and four healthy control dogs. Sera peptides from each sample were processed for TMT 10-plex tagging and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS). Differential proteome profiling was then compared between lymphoma and control. We discovered 20 elevated and 14 decreased serum proteins in the lymphoma group relative to the healthy group. Six candidate increased proteins in canine lymphomas were beta-actin cytoplasmic 1 (ACTB, p=0.04), haptoglobin (p=0.002), beta-2 microglobulin (aaaaaaaa2M, p=0.007), beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (APOH, p=0.03), metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1, p=0.03), and CD44 antigen (p=0.02). When compared between B- and T-cell lymphomas, B-cell phenotypes had upregulated immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain V region GOM (p=0.02), clusterin (p=0.01), apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1, p=0.05), and plasminogen (p=0.02). These findings were investigated quantitative serum proteomes between B- and T-cell lymphomas using TMT-based MS. ACTB, aaaaaaaa2M, APOH, TIMP-1, CD44 antigen, Ig heavy chain V region GOM, and APOC1 are novel candidate proteins and might serve as a lymphoma biomarker in dogs. However, evaluation with an increased sample size is needed to confirm their diagnostic and prognostic ability.	2022	07	16	Vet World	Fonghem	Piyanoot
33404293	10.1080/15548627.2020.1871204	BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy is required for mitochondrial remodeling during the differentiation of optic nerve oligodendrocytes.	Retinal ganglion cell axons are heavily myelinated (98%) and myelin damage in the optic nerve (ON) severely affects vision. Understanding the molecular mechanism of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes will be essential for developing new therapeutic approaches for ON demyelinating diseases. To this end, we developed a new method for isolation and culture of ON-derived oligodendrocyte lineage cells and used it to study OPC differentiation. A critical aspect of cellular differentiation is macroautophagy/autophagy, a catabolic process that allows for cell remodeling by degradation of excess or damaged cellular molecules and organelles. Knockdown of ATG9A and BECN1 (pro-autophagic proteins involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation) led to a significant reduction in proliferation and survival of OPCs. We also found that autophagy flux (a measure of autophagic degradation activity) is significantly increased during progression of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant change in mitochondrial dynamics during oligodendrocyte differentiation, which is associated with a significant increase in programmed mitophagy (selective autophagic clearance of mitochondria). This process is mediated by the mitophagy receptor BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like). BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial network formation, mitochondrial function and the viability of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes. Our studies provide novel evidence that proper mitochondrial dynamics is required for establishment of functional mitochondria in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings are significant because targeting BNIP3L-mediated programmed mitophagy may provide a novel therapeutic approach for stimulating myelin repair in ON demyelinating diseases.<b>Abbreviations:</b> A2B5: a surface antigen of oligodendrocytes precursor cells, A2B5 clone 105; ACTB: actin, beta; APC: an antibody to label mature oligodendrocytes, anti-adenomatous polyposis coli clone CC1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG9A: autophagy related 9A; AU: arbitrary units; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; BNIP3: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; CASP3: caspase 3; CNP: 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase; Ctl: control; COX8: cytochrome c oxidase subunit; CSPG4/NG2: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4; DAPI: 4'6-diamino-2-phenylindole; DNM1L: dynamin 1-like; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FIS1: fission, mitochondrial 1; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP: glial fibrillary growth factor; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HsESC: human embryonic stem cell; IEM: immunoelectron microscopy; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBP: myelin basic protein; MFN2: mitofusin 2; Mito-Keima: mitochondria-targeted monomeric keima-red; Mito-GFP: mitochondria-green fluorescent protein; Mito-RFP: mitochondria-red fluorescent protein; MitoSOX: red mitochondrial superoxide probe; MKI67: antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki 67; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; O4: oligodendrocyte marker O4; OLIG2: oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2; ON: optic nerve; OPA1: OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase; OPC: oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; PDL: poly-D-lysine; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RGC: retinal ganglion cell; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR: real time polymerase chain reaction; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOD2: superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; TUBB: tubulin, beta; TUBB3: tubulin, beta 3 class III.	2022	04	07	Autophagy	Yazdankhah	Meysam
33952317	10.1186/s13148-021-01091-9	Methylated markers accurately distinguish primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) from other CNS tumors.	Definitive diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) requires invasive surgical brain biopsy, causing treatment delays. In this paper, we identified and validated tumor-specific markers that can distinguish PCNSL from other CNS tumors in tissues. In a pilot study, we tested these newly identified markers in plasma. The Methylation Outlier Detector program was used to identify markers in TCGA dataset of 48 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 656 glioblastomas and lower-grade gliomas. Eight methylated markers clearly distinguished DLBCL from gliomas. Marker performance was verified (ROC-AUC of ≥ 0.989) in samples from several GEO datasets (95 PCNSL; 2112 other primary CNS tumors of 11 types). Next, we developed a novel, efficient assay called Tailed Amplicon Multiplexed-Methylation-Specific PCR (TAM-MSP), which uses two of the methylation markers, cg0504 and SCG3 triplexed with ACTB. FFPE tissue sections (25 cases each) of PCNSL and eight types of other primary CNS tumors were analyzed using TAM-MSP. TAM-MSP distinguished PCNSL from the other primary CNS tumors with 100% accuracy (AUC = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, P &lt; 0.001). The TAM-MSP assay also detected as few as 5 copies of fully methylated plasma DNA spiked into 0.5 ml of healthy plasma. In a pilot study of plasma from 15 PCNSL, 5 other CNS tumors and 6 healthy individuals, methylation in cg0504 and SCG3 was detectable in 3/15 PCNSL samples (20%). The Methylation Outlier Detector program identified methylated markers that distinguish PCNSL from other CNS tumors with accuracy. The high level of accuracy achieved by these markers was validated in tissues by a novel method, TAM-MSP. These studies lay a strong foundation for a liquid biopsy-based test to detect PCNSL-specific circulating tumor DNA.	2022	01	24	Clin Epigenetics	Downs	Bradley M
34598060	10.1016/j.ctarc.2021.100465	Prioritising breast cancer theranostics: A current medical longing in oncology.	The Theranostics approach has full potential to completely transform the contemporary medicine system to a patient-centric approach, as it is emerging in quite efficient manner, over the past few years. The primary impetus of this review is to analyse the patent growth in the domain of breast cancer theranostics. This wholesome analysis provides an insight into the current technological and R &amp; D advancement over the years, in breast cancer theranostics. Thus, guide the end-users in getting the conclusion for policymaking and other public recommendations. This patent assessment also foretells about the future trends to carry out further achievements. Due to their easy availability, information richness, &amp; versatility, patent's role in R&amp;D policy has been emphasized by stake holders of innovation including scientists time to time. Graphical Abstract: The figure illustrates the applied technologies used for breast cancer theranostics by top three forward cited patents (A) The oligonucleotides with specific sequences (comprised of at least one of DNA, RNA, PNA. LNA, UNA or combination)<sup>1</sup> are capable of binding a targeted tumor protein (PARP1, HISTIHIB, HISTIHID, NCL, FBL, SFPQ, RPL12, ACTB, HIST1H4A, SSBP1, NONO, H2AFJ, and DDX21, forming a tumor protein complex or subunit or their fragments and might block the tumoral activity.

34925435	10.3389/fgene.2021.677650	Genetic Landscape of Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Systemic Review and Association Analysis With Next-Generation Sequencing.	In our research, we screened 1,495 documents, compiled the whole-exome sequencing data of several studies, formed a data set including 92 observations of RRDLBCL (Relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and performed association analysis on the high-frequency mutations among them. The most common mutations in the data set include TTN, KMT2D, TP53, IGLL5, CREBBP, BCL2, MYD88, and SOCS1 etc. Among these, CREBBP, KMT2D, and BCL2 have a strong association with each other, and SOCS1 has a strong association with genes such as STAT6, ACTB, CIITA, ITPKB, and GNA13. TP53 lacks significant associations with most genes. Through SOM clustering, expression-level analysis and protein interaction analysis of common gene mutations, we believe that RRDLBCL can be divided into five main types. We tested the function of the model and described the clinical characteristics of each subtype through a targeted sequencing RRDLBCL cohort of 96 patients. The classification is stated as follows: 1) JAK-STAT-related type: including STAT6, SOCS1, CIITA, etc. The genetic lineage is similar to PMBL and cHL. Retrospective analysis suggests that this subtype responds poorly to induction therapy (R-CHOP, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). 2) BCL-CREBBP type: Epigenetic mutations such as KMT2D and CREBBP are more common in this type, and are often accompanied by BCL2 and EZH2 mutations. 3) MCD type: including MYD88 and CD79B, PIM1 is more common in this subtype. 4) TP53 mutation: TP53 mutant patients, which suggests the worst prognosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and worst response to CART treatment. 5) Undefined type (Sparse item type): Major Genetic Change Lacking Type, which has a better prognosis and better response to CART treatment. We also reviewed the literature from recent years concerning the previously mentioned common gene mutations.	2021	12	21	Front Genet	Gao	Fan
31242129	10.1080/15548627.2019.1635380	<i>MIR145-3p</i> promotes autophagy and enhances bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma by targeting <i>HDAC4</i>.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with poor survival. Autophagy, a stress-responsive catabolic process mediated by lysosomal activity, plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of MM. Growing evidence has indicated that dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with the aberrant autophagy in various human cancers. However, to date, few miRNAs have been reported to directly modulate autophagy in the pathobiology of MM. In this study, we investigated the role of <i>MIR145-3p</i> (microRNA 145-3p) in MM, with focus on cellular processes autophagy and cell death. Our results provided evidence that downregulation of <i>MIR145-3p</i> expression was associated with disease progression in human MM. <i>MIR145-3p</i> triggered autophagic flux through direct targeting of <i>HDAC4</i> (histone deacetylase 4) in MM cells, leading to enhanced apoptosis. Silencing <i>HDAC4</i> recapitulated the effects of <i>MIR145-3p</i>, whereas enforced expression of <i>HDAC4</i> abrogated the effects of <i>MIR145-3p</i>. Furthermore, we showed that suppression of <i>HDAC4</i> by <i>MIR145-3p</i> resulted in upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BCL2L11 and caused MTORC1 inactivation, which in turn led to enhanced autophagy and cell death. Importantly, we demonstrated that <i>MIR145-3p</i> mimic could potentiate the anti-MM activity of bortezomib in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. Overall, our findings indicate that <i>MIR145-3p</i> exerted a tumor suppression function in MM by inducing autophagic cell death and suggest that <i>MIR145-3p</i>-based targeted therapy would represent a novel strategy for MM treatment.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; 3'-UTR: 3'-untranslated region; 7-AAD: 7-aminoactinomycin D; ACTB: actin beta; ANXA5: annexin A5; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; B2M: beta-2-microglobulin; BAF: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BCL2L11: BCL2 like 11; Bort: bortezomib; CASP3: caspase 3; CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit-8; CQ: chloroquine; Ct: threshold cycle; ctrl: control; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HDAC4: histone deacetylase 4; ISS: International Staging System; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; miRNAs: microRNAs; <i>MIR145-3p</i>: microRNA 145-3p; MM: multiple myeloma; mRNA: messenger RNA; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; PCs: plasma cells; PFS: progression-free survival; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription PCR; RPS6KB1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SD: standard deviation; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; STV: starvation; TUBB: tubulin beta class I.	2021	06	07	Autophagy	Wu	Hongkun
32349449	10.3390/ijms21093093	Prevalence of Cytoplasmic Actin Mutations in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma: A Functional Assessment Based on Actin Three-Dimensional Structures.	Mutations in actins have been linked to several developmental diseases. Their occurrence across different cancers has, however, not been investigated. Using the cBioPortal database we show that human actins are infrequently mutated in patient samples of various cancers types. Nevertheless, ranking these studies by mutational frequency suggest that some have a higher percentage of patients with <i>ACTB</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> mutations. Within studies on hematological cancers, mutations in <i>ACTB</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> are associated with lymphoid cancers since none have currently been reported in myeloid cancers. Within the different types of lymphoid cancers <i>ACTB</i> mutations are most frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and <i>ACTG1</i> mutations in multiple myeloma. We mapped the ACTB and ACTG1 mutations found in these two cancer types on the 3D-structure of actin showing they are in regions important for actin polymer formation or binding to myosin. The potential effects of the mutations on actin properties imply that mutations in cytoplasmic actins deserve dedicated research in DLBCL and multiple myeloma.	2021	02	01	Int J Mol Sci	Witjes	Laura
32565964	10.3892/ol.2020.11552	Comprehensive characterization of driver genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common hematological malignancy and is one of the most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Large-scale genomic studies have defined genetic drivers of DLBCL and their association with functional and clinical outcomes. However, the lymphomagenesis of DLBCL is yet to be fully understood. In the present study, four computational tools OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, integrated Cancer Genome Score and Driver Genes and Pathways were used to detect driver genes and driver pathways involved in DLBCL. The aforementioned tools were also used to perform an integrative investigation of driver genes, including co-expression network, protein-protein interaction, copy number variation and survival analyses. The present study identified 208 driver genes and 31 driver pathways in DLBCL. <i>IGLL5, MLL2, BTG2, B2M, PIM1, CARD11</i> were the top five frequently mutated genes in DLBCL. <i>NOTCH3, LAMC1, COL4A1, PDGFRB</i> and <i>KDR</i> were the 5 hub genes in the blue module that were associated with patient age. <i>TP53, MYC, EGFR, PTEN, IL6, STAT3, MAPK8, TNF</i> and <i>CDH1</i> were at the core of the protein-protein interaction network. <i>PRDM1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, TNFAIP3, RSPO3</i> were the top five frequently deleted driver genes in DLBCL, while <i>ACTB, BTG2, PLET1, CARD11, DIXDC1</i> were the top five frequently amplified driver genes in DLBCL. High <i>EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA</i> and <i>RECQL4</i> expression was associated with decreased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. High <i>XPO1</i> and <i>LYN</i> expression were associated with increased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. The present study improves the understanding of the biological processes and pathways involved in lymphomagenesis. The driver genes, <i>EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA, RECQL4, XPO1</i> and <i>LYN</i>, pave the way for developing prognostic biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for DLBCL.	2020	09	28	Oncol Lett	Fan	Zheng
31108950	10.3390/genes10050376	Identification and Validation of Novel Reference Genes in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Droplet Digital PCR.	Droplet digital PCR is the most robust method for absolute nucleic acid quantification. However, RNA is a very versatile molecule and its abundance is tissue-dependent. RNA quantification is dependent on a reference control to estimate the abundance. Additionally, in cancer, many cellular processes are deregulated which consequently affects the gene expression profiles. In this work, we performed microarray data mining of different childhood cancers and healthy controls. We selected four genes that showed no gene expression variations (<i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i>) and four classical reference genes (<i>ACTB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>RPL4</i> and RPS18). Gene expression was validated in 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by means of droplet digital PCR. We observed that <i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i> were expressed ~100 times less than <i>ACTB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>RPL4</i> and <i>RPS18</i>. However, we observed excellent correlations among the new reference genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). We propose that <i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i> are housekeeping genes with low expression in childhood cancer.	2020	02	14	Genes (Basel)	Villegas-Ruíz	Vanessa
29433359	10.1080/15548627.2017.1390636	Piperlongumine restores the balance of autophagy and apoptosis by increasing BCL2 phosphorylation in rotenone-induced Parkinson disease models.	Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease and is caused by genetics, environmental factors and aging, with few treatments currently available. Apoptosis and macroautophagy/autophagy play critical roles in PD pathogenesis; as such, modulating their balance is a potential treatment strategy. BCL2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) is a key molecule regulating this balance. Piperlongumine (PLG) is an alkaloid extracted from Piper longum L. that has antiinflammatory and anticancer effects. The present study investigated the protective effects of PLG in rotenone-induced PD cell and mouse models. We found that PLG administration (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 4 wk attenuated motor deficits in mice and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra induced by oral administration of rotenone (10 mg/kg) for 6 wk. PLG improved cell viability and enhanced mitochondrial function in primary neurons and SK-N-SH cells. These protective effects were exerted via inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy through enhancement of BCL2 phosphorylation at Ser70. These results demonstrate that PLG exerts therapeutic effects in a rotenone-induced PD models by restoring the balance between apoptosis and autophagy. 6-OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine; ACTB, actin, beta; BafA1, bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BAK1, BCL2-antagonist/killer 1; BAX, BCL2-associated X protein; BCL2, B cell leukemia/lymphoma2; BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy related; CoQ10, coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>; COX4I1/COX IV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; CsA, cyclosporine A; ED50, 50% effective dose; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; JC-1, tetraethylbenz-imidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; l-dopa, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine; MAPK8/JNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NFE2L2/NRF2, nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PD, Parkinson disease; PLG, piperlongumine; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PI, propidium iodide; PtdIns3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PTX, paclitaxel; Rap, rapamycin; SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome 1; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; WIPI2, WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2; ZFYVE1/DFCP1, zinc finger, FYVE domain containing 1.	2019	10	03	Autophagy	Liu	Jia
27868373	10.1002/ajmg.a.38057	Acute myeloid leukemia in Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome.	Baraitser-Winter malformation syndrome (BWMS), Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FA), and craniofrontofacial syndromes (CFFs) have all been recently proposed to be part of the same phenotypic spectrum of Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF), which is characterized by facial dysmorphism, ocular coloboma, brain malformations, and intellectual disabilities. In addition to that, the recent discovery of missense mutations in one of the two ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic β- and γ-acting-encoding genes ACTB (7p22.1) and ACTG1 (17q25.3) in patients carrying a clinical diagnosis of BWSM, FA, or CCF has provided further evidence that these clinical conditions do indeed belong to the same entity at the molecular level. Two cases of BWCFF patients presenting with malignancies (i.e., acute lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous lymphoma) have been published thus far. Here, we report a 21-year-old female with molecularly confirmed FA, who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The present finding may indicate that actinopathies could be cancer-predisposing syndromes although small numbers and publication bias should be taken into account. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2017	10	24	Am J Med Genet A	Cianci	Paola
28807016	10.1186/s12885-017-3536-6	Endogenous controls of gene expression in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced T-cell lymphoma in p53-deficient mice.	Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an increasingly important technique for gene expression profiling because it can provide insights into complex biological and pathological processes and be used to predict disease or treatment outcomes. Although normalized data are necessary for an accurate estimation of mRNA expression levels, several pieces of evidence suggest that the expression of so-called housekeeping genes is not stable. This study aimed to validate reference genes for the normalization of real-time PCR in an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced T-cell lymphoma mouse model. T-cell lymphomas were generated in p53-deficient mice by treatment with 37.5 mg/kg MNU. Thymus and spleen were identified as the primary target organs with the highest incidences of lymphomas. We analyzed the RNA expression levels of eight potential endogenous reference genes (Gapdh, Rn18s, Actb, Hprt, B2M, Rplp0, Gusb, Ctbp1). The expression stabilities of these reference genes were tested at different time points after MNU treatment using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. A total of 65% of MNU-treated mice developed T-cell lymphomas, with the spleen and thymus as the major target organs. All candidate reference genes were amplified efficiently by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene stability evaluation after MNU treatment and during lymphomagenesis revealed that Ctbp1 and Rplp0 were the most stably expressed genes in the thymus and spleen, respectively. RT-PCR of thymus RNA using two additional sets of primer confirmed that Ctbp1 was the most stable of all the candidate reference genes. We provided suitable endogenous controls for gene expression studies in the T-cell lymphoma model.	2018	05	03	BMC Cancer	Wu	Xi
26852652	10.1016/j.bcmd.2015.11.006	ETV6/RUNX1 transcript is a target of RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The oncofetal RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 (IGF2 mRNA binding protein 1) is overexpressed in a subset of cancers and promotes cell cycle, migration and aggressive phenotype by regulating post-transcriptionally a number of key mRNAs (e. g, ACTB, CD44, CTNNB1, KRAS, MAPK4, MYC, PTEN and others). IGF2BP1 is also overexpressed in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the biological significance of this phenomenon has not been addressed so far. We have identified leukemia fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA to be highly enriched in immunoprecipitated fraction of endogenous IGF2BP1 from a model cell line REH and t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL samples. Furthermore, downregulation of IGF2BP1 by two-fold has resulted in a corresponding decrease of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA validating this transcript as a target of IGF2BP1 protein in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. These data infer that IGF2BP1 is a potent regulator of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA stability and potentially link this evolutionary-highly conserved protein to cell transformation events in ETV6/RUNX1-mediated leukemogenesis of t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. 	2016	10	25	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Stoskus	Mindaugas
25052316	10.1038/ejhg.2014.95	Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome: delineation of the spectrum in 42 cases.	Baraitser-Winter, Fryns-Aftimos and cerebrofrontofacial syndrome types 1 and 3 have recently been associated with heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in one of the two ubiquitous cytoplasmic actin-encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1 that encode β- and γ-actins. We present detailed phenotypic descriptions and neuroimaging on 36 patients analyzed by our group and six cases from the literature with a molecularly proven actinopathy (9 ACTG1 and 33 ACTB). The major clinical anomalies are striking dysmorphic facial features with hypertelorism, broad nose with large tip and prominent root, congenital non-myopathic ptosis, ridged metopic suture and arched eyebrows. Iris or retinal coloboma is present in many cases, as is sensorineural deafness. Cleft lip and palate, hallux duplex, congenital heart defects and renal tract anomalies are seen in some cases. Microcephaly may develop with time. Nearly all patients with ACTG1 mutations, and around 60% of those with ACTB mutations have some degree of pachygyria with anteroposterior severity gradient, rarely lissencephaly or neuronal heterotopia. Reduction of shoulder girdle muscle bulk and progressive joint stiffness is common. Early muscular involvement, occasionally with congenital arthrogryposis, may be present. Progressive, severe dystonia was seen in one family. Intellectual disability and epilepsy are variable in severity and largely correlate with CNS anomalies. One patient developed acute lymphocytic leukemia, and another a cutaneous lymphoma, indicating that actinopathies may be cancer-predisposing disorders. Considering the multifaceted role of actins in cell physiology, we hypothesize that some clinical manifestations may be partially mutation specific. Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome is our suggested designation for this clinical entity. 	2015	10	22	Eur J Hum Genet	Verloes	Alain
25696013		Selection of superior reference genes' combination for quantitative real-time PCR in B-cell lymphomas.	Normalization of real-time quantitative PCR data to appropriate reference genes is crucial to accurately interpret results. Many genes commonly used as reference standards do not perform as expected, depending on cell type and experimental design. In our previous work, we addressed the issue of suitable reference genes for lymphoid tissue and successfully applied the normalization factor-based approach to discriminate lymphoid malignancies according to their cyclin D1 mRNA level. Here, we addressed the problem of reference gene selection and sufficient number on an enlarged sample set with seven candidate genes. The experimental set included 165 samples of spleens, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with different types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas along with non-neoplastic lymphoid specimens. For the first time, we compared all major stability ranking algorithms of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) applets geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder and tested candidate reference genes on a large and heterogeneous set of fresh clinical lymphoid samples. We concluded that a normalization-based approach using three reference genes (YWHAZ, UBC and ACTB) allows for robust reduction of the variance in real-time PCR results and that the further addition of reference genes does not improve data normalization. This creates a clinically applicable tool for PCR-based lymphoma diagnostics. 	2015	12	15	Ann Clin Lab Sci	Potashnikova	Daria
25715028	10.1080/15548627.2015.1017191	BAX and BAK1 are dispensable for ABT-737-induced dissociation of the BCL2-BECN1 complex and autophagy.	Disruption of the complex of BECN1 with BCL2 or BCL2L1/BCL-XL is an essential switch that turns on cellular autophagy in response to environmental stress or treatment with BH3 peptidomimetics. Recently, it has been proposed that BCL2 and BCL2L1/BCL-XL may inhibit autophagy indirectly through a mechanism dependent on the proapoptotic BCL2 family members, BAX and BAK1. Here we report that the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, induces autophagy in parallel with disruption of BCL2-BECN1 binding in 2 different apoptosis-deficient cell types lacking BAX and BAK1, namely in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells and in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. We conclude that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 induces autophagy through a BAX and BAK1-independent mechanism that likely involves disruption of BECN1 binding to antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. 	2016	03	07	Autophagy	Pedro	Jose Manuel Bravo-San
25984893	10.1080/15548627.2015.1034402	The GST-BHMT assay reveals a distinct mechanism underlying proteasome inhibition-induced macroautophagy in mammalian cells.	By monitoring the fragmentation of a GST-BHMT (a protein fusion of glutathionine S-transferase N-terminal to betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase) reporter in lysosomes, the GST-BHMT assay has previously been established as an endpoint, cargo-based assay for starvation-induced autophagy that is largely nonselective. Here, we demonstrate that under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inhibition by either pharmaceutical or genetic manipulations induces similar autophagy-dependent GST-BHMT processing. However, mechanistically this proteasome inhibition-induced autophagy is different from that induced by starvation as it does not rely on regulation by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase]) and PRKAA/AMPK (protein kinase, AMP-activated, α catalytic subunit), the upstream central sensors of cellular nutrition and energy status, but requires the presence of the cargo receptors SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) and NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) that are normally involved in the selective autophagy pathway. Further, it depends on ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress signaling, in particular ERN1/IRE1 (endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1) and its main downstream effector MAPK8/JNK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 8), but not XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), by regulating the phosphorylation-dependent disassociation of BCL2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) from BECN1 (Beclin 1, autophagy related). Moreover, the multimerization domain of GST-BHMT is required for its processing in response to proteasome inhibition, in contrast to its dispensable role in starvation-induced processing. Together, these findings support a model in which under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inactivation induces autophagy-dependent processing of the GST-BHMT reporter through a distinct mechanism that bears notable similarity with the yeast Cvt (cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting) pathway, and suggest the GST-BHMT reporter might be employed as a convenient assay to study selective macroautophagy in mammalian cells. 	2016	02	23	Autophagy	Rui	Yan-Ning
26043155	10.1080/15548627.2015.1055439	TNFAIP3 promotes survival of CD4 T cells by restricting MTOR and promoting autophagy.	Autophagy plays important roles in metabolism, differentiation, and survival in T cells. TNFAIP3/A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that is thought to be a negative regulator of autophagy in cell lines. However, the role of TNFAIP3 in autophagy remains unclear. To determine whether TNFAIP3 regulates autophagy in CD4 T cells, we first analyzed Tnfaip3-deficient naïve CD4 T cells in vitro. We demonstrated that Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited reduced MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) puncta formation, increased mitochondrial content, and exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These results indicate that TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in CD4 T cells. We then investigated the mechanism by which TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy signaling. We found that TNFAIP3 bound to the MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complex and that Tnfaip3-deficient cells displayed enhanced ubiquitination of the MTOR complex and MTOR activity. To confirm the effects of enhanced MTOR activity in Tnfaip3-deficient cells, we analyzed cell survival following treatment with Torin1, an MTOR inhibitor. Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited fewer cell numbers than the control cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the impaired survival of Tnfaip3-deficient cells was ameliorated with Torin1 treatment in vitro and in vivo. The effect of Torin1 was abolished by Atg5 deficiency. Thus, enhanced MTOR activity regulates the survival of Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells. Taken together, our findings illustrate that TNFAIP3 restricts MTOR signaling and promotes autophagy, providing new insight into the manner in which MTOR and autophagy regulate survival in CD4 T cells. 	2016	04	18	Autophagy	Matsuzawa	Yu
24275555	10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.11.021	Peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure induces sex-specific programming of disease susceptibilities in adult mouse offspring.	Vulnerability of the fetus upon maternal obesity can potentially occur during all developmental phases. We aimed at elaborating longer-term health outcomes of fetal overnutrition during the earliest stages of development. We utilized Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice to induce pre-conceptional and gestational obesity and followed offspring outcomes in the absence of any postnatal obesogenic influences. Male adult offspring developed overweight, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis; all these features were not observed in females. Instead, they showed impaired fasting glucose and a reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. Influences of the interaction of maternal diet∗sex concerned offspring genes involved in fatty liver disease, lipid droplet size regulation and fat mass expansion. These data suggest that a peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure is sufficient to shape offspring gene expression patterns and health outcomes in a sex- and organ-specific manner, indicating varying developmental vulnerabilities between sexes towards metabolic disease in response to maternal overnutrition. 	2014	04	16	Biochim Biophys Acta	Dahlhoff	M
24418552	10.1016/j.virol.2013.11.022	HTLV-1 infects human mesenchymal stromal cell in vitro and modifies their phenotypic characteristics.	The typical characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be affected by inflammatory microenvironment; however, the exact contribution of HTLV-1 to MSC dysfunction remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that MSC cell surface molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are upregulated by contact with HTLV-1, and HLA-DR was most highly expressed in MSCs co-cultured with MT2 cells. The expression levels of VCAM-1 and HLA-DR were increased in MSCs cultured in the presence of PBMCs isolated from HTLV-1-infected symptomatic individuals compared with those cultured with cells from asymptomatic infected individuals or healthy subjects. HTLV-1 does not impair the MSC differentiation process into osteocytes and adipocytes. In addition, MSCs were efficiently infected with HTLV-1 in vitro through direct contact with HTLV-1-infected cells; however, cell-free virus particles were not capable of causing infection. In summary, HTLV-1 can alter MSC function, and this mechanism may contribute to the pathogenesis of this viral infection. 	2014	04	07	Virology	Rodrigues	Evandra Strazza
23266771	10.1016/j.cca.2012.12.012	ACTB in cancer.	Beta-actin (ACTB) has traditionally been regarded as an endogenous housekeeping gene and has been widely used as a reference gene/protein in quantifying expression levels in tumors. However, ACTB is closely associated with a variety of cancers and accumulating evidence indicates that ACTB is de-regulated in liver, melanoma, renal, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, breast, prostate, ovarian cancers, leukemia and lymphoma. ACTB is generally found to be up-regulated in the majority of tumor cells and tissues. The abnormal expression and polymerization of ACTB and the resulting changes to the cytoskeleton are revealed to be associated with the invasiveness and metastasis of cancers. The current review explores relevant mechanisms, integrates current understandings, and provides suggestions for future studies of the roles of ACTB in tumors.	2013	08	27	Clin Chim Acta	Guo	Chunmei
23326330	10.1371/journal.pone.0052384	Activated ERM protein plays a critical role in drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25.	We have previously demonstrated that the CCR9/CCL25 signaling pathway plays an important role in drug resistance in human acute T-lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) by inducing activation of ERM protein with polarized distribution in T-ALL cell line MOLT4. However, the mechanism of action of the activated ERM protein in the drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25 remains uncharacterized. Here we investigated the mechanism of CCR9/CCL25-initiated drug resistance in CCR9-high-expressing T-ALL cells. Our results showed that 1) the function of P-gp was increased after treatment with CCL25; 2) P-gp colocalized and co-immunoprecipitated with p-ERM and F-actin in CCL25 treated cells; and 3) ERM-shRNA conferred drug sensitivity coincident with release of ERM interactions with P-gp and F-actin after treatment with CCL25. These data suggest it is pivotal that P-gp associate with the F-actin cytoskeleton through p-ERM in CCR9/CCL25 induced multidrug resistance of T-ALL cells. Strategies aimed at inhibiting P-gp-F-actin cytoskeleton association may be helpful in increasing the efficiency of therapies in T-ALL.	2013	07	05	PLoS One	Zhang	Li
23849470	10.1186/1756-8722-6-52	Protein biomarkers distinguish between high- and low-risk pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a tissue specific manner.	The current study evaluated the differential expression detected in the proteomic profiles of low risk- and high risk- ALL pediatric patients to characterize candidate biomarkers related to diagnosis, prognosis and patient targeted therapy. Bone marrow and peripheral blood plasma and cell lysates samples were obtained from pediatric patients with low- (LR) and high-risk (HR) ALL at diagnosis. As controls, non-leukemic pediatric patients were studied. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out by G- banding and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization. Differential proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The differential expression of certain proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The obtained data revealed that CLUS, CERU, APOE, APOA4, APOA1, GELS, S10A9, AMBP, ACTB, CATA and AFAM proteins play a significant role in leukemia prognosis, potentially serving as distinctive biomarkers for leukemia aggressiveness, or as suppressor proteins in HR-ALL cases. In addition, vitronectin and plasminogen probably contributed to leukemogenesis, whilst bicaudal D-related protein 1 could afford a significant biomarker for pediatric ALL therapeutics. 	2014	05	05	J Hematol Oncol	Braoudaki	Maria
22343534	10.1073/pnas.1121343109	Discovery and prioritization of somatic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by whole-exome sequencing.	To gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.	2012	05	04	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Lohr	Jens G
19309015	10.1002/elps.200800508	2-D PAGE-based comparison of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in sensitive and resistant mantle cell lymphoma.	Although gene expression following bortezomib treatment has been previously explored, direct effects of bortezomib-induced proteasome inhibition on protein level has not been analyzed so far. Using 2-D PAGE in five mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, we screened for cellular protein level alterations following treatment with 25 nM bortezomib for up to 4 h. Using MS, we identified 38 of the 41 most prominent reliably detected protein spots. Twenty-one were affected in all cell lines, whereas the remaining 20 protein spots were exclusively altered in sensitive cell lines. Western blot analysis was performed for 17 of the 38 identified proteins and 70.6% of the observed protein level alterations in 2-D gels was verified. All cell lines exhibited alterations of the cellular protein levels of heat shock-induced protein species (HSPA9, HSP7C, HSPA5, HSPD1), whereas sensitive cell lines also displayed altered cellular protein levels of energy metabolism (ATP5B, AK5, TPI1, ENO-1, ALDOC, GAPDH), RNA and transcriptional regulation (HNRPL, SFRS12) and cell division (NEBL, ACTB, SMC1A, C20orf23) as well as tumor suppressor genes (ENO-1, FH). These proteins clustered in a tight interaction network centered on the major cellular checkpoints TP53. The results were confirmed in primary mantle cell lymphoma, thus confirming the critical role of these candidate proteins of proteasome inhibition.	2009	08	18	Electrophoresis	Weinkauf	Marc
20031021	10.1016/j.rbmo.2009.09.024	Apoptosis in normal ovaries of women with and without endometriosis.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors predisposing to implants of endometriotic lesions in normal ovarian cortexes of women with and without endometriosis by assessing the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors and follicular density. Ovarian biopsies were performed during laparoscopy in 18 patients with endometrioma and in 10 healthy women. Detection of apoptosis was performed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay. p53 and BCL2 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate BAX , BAK , BCL2 , BCL-XL , survivin and beta-actin ( ACTB ) expression. The p53 protein was positive in a significantly higher number of secondary follicles, whereas the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein was positive in all follicles in unaffected tissue of endometriotic women, compared with the controls. Overexpression of the BCL2 and survivin genes and a decreased BAX and BAK gene expression were observed in the endometriotic group although only the difference in survivin expression was significant (P = 0.016). The BCL2 / BAX ratio showed an increased value in the ovarian cortex in controls compared with endometriosis patients. In conclusion, the reduction of apoptosis in unaffected tissue in women with endometriosis suggests that they may be predisposed to develop endometriosis.	2010	02	25	Reprod Biomed Online	Depalo	Raffaella
17823310	10.1182/blood-2007-04-087775	HGAL, a lymphoma prognostic biomarker, interacts with the cytoskeleton and mediates the effects of IL-6 on cell migration.	HGAL is a newly identified germinal center (GC)-specific gene whose expression by the tumor cells correlates with a favorable prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. The function of HGAL is unknown. Previous studies demonstrated that HGAL is dispensable for GC formation, immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. Herein, we identify a role for HGAL in the regulation of cell motility. We demonstrate that IL-6 induces the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue of the HGAL protein via the Lyn kinase, and promotes its relocalization from the cytoplasm to podosome-like structures. Further, IL-6-induced HGAL phosphorylation increases its interaction with myosin II and is associated with inhibition of cell migration. Knockdown of endogenous HGAL ameliorates IL-6-induced inhibition of cell migration, whereas overexpression of HGAL imparts inhibitory effects of IL-6 on cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that HGAL is involved in negative regulation of lymphocyte migration, thus constraining lymphocytes to the GC. Inhibition of lymphocyte migration might contribute to the less aggressive clinical behavior of HGAL-expressing lymphomas.	2008	02	26	Blood	Lu	Xiaoqing
16105984	10.1182/blood-2005-03-1204	p130Cas mediates the transforming properties of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase.	Translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been described in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) and in stromal tumors. The most frequent translocation, t(2;5), generates the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Along with transformation, NPM-ALK induces morphologic changes in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells, suggesting a direct role of ALK in cell shaping. In this study, we used a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach to search for proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and identified p130Cas (p130 Crk-associated substrate) as a novel interactor of NPM-ALK. In 293 cells and in fibroblasts as well as in human ALK-positive lymphoma cell lines, NPM-ALK was able to bind p130Cas and to induce its phosphorylation. Both of the effects were dependent on ALK kinase activity and on the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), since no binding or phosphorylation was found with the kinase-dead mutant NPM-ALK(K210R) or in the presence of a Grb2 dominant-negative protein. Phosphorylation of p130Cas by NPM-ALK was partially independent from Src (tyrosine kinase pp60c-src) kinase activity, as it was still detectable in Syf-/- cells. Finally, p130Cas-/- (also known as Bcar1-/-) fibroblasts expressing NPM-ALK showed impaired actin filament depolymerization and were no longer transformed compared with wild-type cells, indicating an essential role of p130Cas activation in ALK-mediated transformation.	2006	01	18	Blood	Ambrogio	Chiara
1505215	10.1159/000133336	Sublocalization of an invasion-inducing locus and other genes on human chromosome 7.	By somatic cell fusion studies between noninvasive mouse T-lymphoma cells and invasive human activated normal T-cells we have previously shown that the genetic information responsible for the induction of invasive and metastatic potential in interspecies T-cell hybrids is located on human chromosome 7. Apparently, genes derived from normal activated T-cells are dominantly expressed in the hybrids and control the invasive and, as a consequence, metastatic potential of these T-lymphoma cells. To sublocalize the invasion-inducing locus on chromosome 7 we have generated hybrids that harbor only specific regions of human chromosome 7 with or without a small fragment of human chromosome 21. Analysis of these hybrids revealed that the invasion-inducing locus maps to 7p12----cen. The human DNA complement of the hybrids was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a large panel of chromosome 7-specific DNA probes. Several of these genes could be further sublocalized. These included: ARAF2 to 7p12----cen, D7S21 to 7pter----p12, ACTB to 7p15----p12, EGFR to 7p12, MDH2 to 7cen----q22, and PDGFA to 7pter----p15.	1992	09	22	Cytogenet Cell Genet	Habets	G G
34265801	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001780	Plasticity of Mature B Cells Between Follicular and Classic Hodgkin Lymphomas: A Series of 22 Cases Expanding the Spectrum of Transdifferentiation.	Follicular lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma can be associated in composite and/or sequential lymphomas. Common IGH and BCL2 rearrangements have already been identified between both contingents of these entities, but mutation profiles have not yet been investigated. The main objective of this study was to analyze the transdifferentiation process that may occur between Hodgkin and follicular contingents in sequential and composite lymphomas to better characterize these entities. From 2004 to 2020, a retrospective multicentric study was performed, including 9 composite and 13 sequential lymphomas. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, polymerase chain reaction of IGH and IGK rearrangements, next-generation sequencing of IGK rearrangement, and targeted next-generation sequencing (TNGS) on a panel of genes frequently mutated in lymphomas were performed on each contingent of composite and sequential lymphomas. For TNGS, each contingent was isolated by laser capture microdissection. Clinical presentation and evolution were more aggressive in sequential than composite lymphomas. By fluorescent in situ hybridization, common rearrangements of BCL6 and BCL2 were identified between both contingents. Similarly, a common clonal relationship was established by evaluating IGH and IGK rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing. By TNGS, the same pathogenic variants were identified in both contingents in the following genes: CREBBP, KMT2D, BCL2, EP300, SF3B1, SOCS1, ARID1A, and BCOR. Specific pathogenic variants for each contingent were also identified: XPO1 for Hodgkin lymphoma contingent and FOXO1, TNFRSF14 for follicular lymphoma contingent. This study reinforces the hypothesis of a transdifferentiation process between Hodgkin and follicular contingent of sequential/composite lymphomas.	2022	02	14	Am J Surg Pathol	Trecourt	Alexis
34560683	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001813	A Comprehensive Clinicopathologic and Molecular Study of 19 Primary Effusion Lymphomas in HIV-infected Patients.	Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is associated with human herpesvirus 8 and frequently with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We report here a single-center series of 19 human immunodeficiency virus-associated PELs, including 14 EBV+ and 5 EBV- PELs. The objectives were to describe the clinicopathologic features of PELs, with a focus on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, to search for genetic alterations by targeted deep sequencing analysis, and to compare the features between EBV+ and EBV- cases. All the patients were male, and the median age at diagnosis was 47 years old (interquartile range: 40 to 56 y). Reflecting the terminal B-cell differentiation, immunophenotypic profiles showed low expression levels of B-cell markers, including CD19 (0/19), CD20 (1/19), CD79a (0/19), PAX5 (1/19), BOB1 (3/19), and OCT2 (4/19), contrasting with a common expression of CD38 (10/19), CD138 (7/19), and IRF4/MUM1 (18/19). We observed a frequent aberrant expression of T-cell markers, especially CD3 (10/19), and less frequently CD2 (2/19), CD4 (3/19), CD5 (1/19), and CD8 (0/19). Only 2 cases were PD-L1 positive on tumor cells and none PD-1 positive. With respect to immune cells, 3 samples tested positive for PD-L1 and 5 for PD-1. Our 36-gene lymphopanel revealed 7 distinct variants in 5/10 PELs, with either a single or 2 mutations per sample: B2M (n=2), CD58 (n=1), EP300 (n=1), TNFAIP3 (n=1), ARID1A (n=1), and TP53 (n=1). Finally, we did not observe any major clinical, pathologic, or immunohistochemical differences between EBV+ and EBV- PELs and the outcome was similar (2-y overall survival probability of 61.9% [95% confidence interval, 31.2-82.1] vs. 60.0% [95% confidence interval, 12.6-88.2], respectively, P=0.62).	2022	03	07	Am J Surg Pathol	Calvani	Julien
34649275	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005316	Worse outcome and distinct mutational pattern in follicular lymphoma with anti-HBc positivity.	Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), mainly for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). We studied a cohort of 121 patients with FL for HBV infection status, clinical features, and gene mutational profile. Anti-HBc was detectable in 16 patients (13.2%), although all had undetectable HBV DNA. Anti-HBcore+ (anti-HBc+) cases presented with older age at diagnosis than anti-HBc- cases (68.1 vs 57.2 years; P = .007) and higher β2-microglobulin (56.3% vs 28.9%; P = .04). All patients included in the study fulfilled criteria for treatment and received therapy with rituximab or rituximab-containing chemotherapy. There were no episodes of HBV reactivation or HBV hepatitis during treatment and/or maintenance. Remarkably, anti-HBc+ patients had significantly lower 10-year progression-free survival (PFS; 12.9% vs 58.3%; P &lt; .0001) and overall survival (OS; 22.0% vs 86.2%; P &lt; .0001), that remained at multivariate analysis. Gene mutational profiling of all cases showed that anti-HBc+ cases had higher incidence of ARID1A mutations and absence of EP300 mutations, 2 key epigenetic regulators in FL. Overall, our study shows that FL patients with resolved HBV infection have a worse outcome independently of other well-known clinical risk factors and a distinct gene mutational profile.	2022	03	10	Blood Adv	Fernández-Rodríguez	Concepción
34791836	10.1002/cam4.4422	Identification of a genetic signature enriching for response to ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma in the DAWN phase 2 trial.	The single-arm DAWN trial (NCT01779791) of ibrutinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 20.9% and a median response duration of 19.4 months. This biomarker analysis of the DAWN dataset sought to determine genetic classifiers for prediction of response to ibrutinib treatment. Whole exome sequencing was performed on baseline tumor samples. Potential germline variants were excluded; a custom set of 1216 cancer-related genes was examined. Responder- versus nonresponder-associated variants were identified using Fisher's exact test. Classifiers with increasing numbers of genes were created using a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selected genes, adding the most nonresponders to the existing ""predicted nonresponders"" set and were evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. Exome data were generated from 88 patient samples and 13,554 somatic mutation variants were inferred. Response data were available for 83 patients (17 responders, 66 nonresponders). Each sample showed 100 to &gt;500 mutated genes, with greater variance across nonresponders. The overall variant pattern was consistent with previous FL studies; 75 genes had mutations in &gt;10% of patients, including genes previously reported as associated with FL. Univariate analysis yielded responder-associated genes FANCA, HISTH1B, ANXA6, BTG1, and PARP10, highlighting the importance of functions outside of B-cell receptor signaling, including epigenetic processes, DNA damage repair, cell cycle/proliferation, and cell motility/invasiveness. While nonresponder-associated genes included well-known TP53 and CARD11, genetic classifiers developed using nonresponder-associated genes included ATP6AP1, EP400, ARID1A, SOCS1, and TBL1XR1, suggesting resistance to ibrutinib may be related to broad biological functions connected to epigenetic modification, telomere maintenance, and cancer-associated signaling pathways (mTOR, JAK/STAT, NF-κB). The results from univariate and genetic classifier analyses provide insights into genes associated with response or resistance to ibrutinib in FL and identify a classifier developed using nonresponder-associated genes, which warrants further investigation.

35038193	10.1111/his.14617	Incidence, clinicopathological features and genetics of in-situ follicular neoplasia: a comprehensive screening study in a Japanese cohort.	In-situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN) is a histologically recognizable neoplastic proliferation of follicular lymphoma (FL)-like B cells confined to the germinal centres. While some ISFNs are associated with overt FL, others are incidentally identified as isolated or pure forms in individuals without evidence of overt FL. The prevalence of incidentally found isolated ISFN is approximately 3% in Europe; however, no screening study has been conducted in Asia. To investigate the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of ISFNs in the Japanese population, we conducted histopathological screening of the lymph nodes (LNs) resected for solid tumours or inflammatory conditions. We screened for ISFN in 5700 LNs from 340 individuals using immunohistochemistry for BCL2 and identified seven ISFNs, with an incidence of 2.1%. The median age of the individuals with ISFN was 67 years, none of whom developed overt FL, with a median follow-up of 59 months. Next-generation sequencing was performed in five ISFNs, and 10 variants in seven FL-associated genes were identified. The identified variants included HIST1H1E (n = 2), ARID1A (n = 2), KMT2D (n = 1), CARD11 (n = 1), BCL7A (n = 1), CREBBP (n = 1) and TNFRSF14 (n = 1). The incidence of isolated ISFN in the Japanese population is not significantly different from that in Europe, presumably reflecting the recent increase in FL in Japan. These incidentally found ISFNs have a low potential to transform into overt FL. Although mutations of FL-associated genes are already present in ISFNs, further molecular studies are needed to identify driver genes leading to the transformation of ISFN to overt FL.	2022	03	30	Histopathology	Oishi	Naoki
35054466	10.3390/life12010073	The Pathologic and Genetic Characteristics of Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma.	Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a neoplasm of NK cells or cytotoxic T cells presenting in extranodal sites, most often in the nasal cavity. The typical immunophenotypes are cCD3+, sCD3-, CD4-, CD5-, CD8-, CD16-, and CD56+ with the expression of cytotoxic molecules. Tumor subsets express NK cell receptors, CD95/CD95L, CD30, MYC, and PDL1. Virtually all the tumor cells harbor the EBV genome, which plays a key role in lymphomagenesis as an epigenetic driver. EBV-encoded oncoproteins modulate the host-cell epigenetic machinery, reprogramming the viral and host epigenomes using host epigenetic modifiers. NGS analysis revealed the mutational landscape of ENKTL, predominantly involving the JAK-STAT pathway, epigenetic modifications, the RNA helicase family, the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, and tumor suppressors, which indicate an important role of these pathways and this group of genes in the lymphomagenesis of ENKTL. Recently, three molecular subtypes were proposed, the tumor-suppressor/immune-modulator (TSIM), MGA-BRDT (MB), and HDAC9-EP300-ARID1A (HEA) subtypes, and they are well-correlated with the cell of origin, EBV pattern, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes. A future investigation into the function and interaction of discovered genes would be very helpful for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of ENKTL and establishing better treatment strategies.	2022	01	28	Life (Basel)	Kim	Hyunsung
35172382	10.1002/JLB.5A0721-361R	Genomic heterogeneity contributed to different prognosis between adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic.	The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults is inferior to that in children. Hence, ALL remains challenging to cure in the adult population. Aberrant genetic alterations have been observed in ALL, although the patterns of differential gene alterations in adult and pediatric ALL have not been comprehensively determined on a genome-wide scale. We investigated the biologic differences in genomic profiles between adults (n = 64) and children (n = 54) with ALL and relationship between genomic heterogeneity and prognosis. The 2 populations showed similar common mutation types but an increased prevalence of genetic alterations in adult ALL. The median numbers of gene mutations were 17 (range: 1-53) and 4.5 (range: 1-19) per sample in adult and pediatric ALL, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). An increased number of gene mutations and age were significantly correlated (R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.5853, p &lt; 0.001). We identified 122 and 53 driver genes in adult and pediatric ALL samples, respectively. IKZF1, IDH1, and TTN mutations were significantly enriched in adult patients with ALL. KRAS, ARID1A, and CREBBP mutations were significantly enriched in pediatric patients with ALL (p &lt; 0.05). The incidence of relapse was 40.0% and 9.6% in adult and pediatric patients with ALL, respectively (p = 0.003). The overall survival and relapse-free survival of adult patients with ALL were poorer than those of pediatric patients with ALL (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). This genomic landscape enhances the understanding of the biologic differences in ALL between the 2 populations and provides insight for developing therapeutic approaches.	2022	08	26	J Leukoc Biol	Chen	Yanxin
35317330	10.14740/wjon1436	Non-GCB Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma With an Atypical Disease Course: A Case Report and Clinical Exome Analysis.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid tumor among other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (30-40% of all cases). This type of lymphoma is characterized by significant differences in treatment response and the heterogeneity of clinical traits. Approximately 60% of patients are cured using standard chemotherapy (CT), while in 10-15% of cases, the tumor is characterized by an extremely aggressive course and resistance to even the most high-dose programs with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is characterized by poor prognosis. Here, we describe a clinical case of diffuse ABC-DLBCL with an atypical disease course. Complete remission was achieved after four courses of CT, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). However, early relapse occurred 2 months after the completion of treatment. According to the results of cytogenetic studies, significant chromosome breakdowns were observed. Exome sequencing allowed for the detection of several novel mutations that affect components of the NOTCH2 and NF-κB signaling pathways, a number of epigenetic regulators (<i>KMT2D</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>MEF2B</i>), as well as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (<i>CD58</i> and <i>CD70</i>). Whether these mutations were the result of therapy or were originally present in the lymphoid tumor remains unclear. Nevertheless, the introduction of genomic technologies into clinical practice is important for making a diagnosis and developing a DLBCL treatment regimen with the use of targeted drugs.	2022	03	24	World J Oncol	Tsygankova	Svetlana
35454811	10.3390/cancers14081904	Deciphering Genetic Alterations of Hairy Cell Leukemia and Hairy Cell Leukemia-like Disorders in 98 Patients.	Hairy cell leukemia (cHCL) patients have, in most cases, a specific clinical and biological presentation with splenomegaly, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, monocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia, identification of hairy cells that express CD103, CD123, CD25, CD11c and identification of the V600E mutation in the B-Raf proto-oncogene (<i>BRAF</i>) in 90% of cases. Monocytopenia is absent in vHCL and SDRPL patients and the abnormal cells do not express CD25 or CD123 and do not present the <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation. Ten percent of cHCL patients are BRAF<sup>WT</sup> and the distinction between cHCL and HCL-like disorders including the variant form of HCL (vHCL) and splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) can be challenging. We performed deep sequencing in a large cohort of 84 cHCL and 16 HCL-like disorders to improve insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases. <i>BRAF</i> mutations were detected in 76/82 patients of cHCL (93%) and additional mutations were identified in Krüppel-like Factor 2 (<i>KLF2</i>) in 19 patients (23%) or <i>CDKN1B</i> in 6 patients (7.5%). Some <i>KLF2</i> genetic alterations were localized on the cytidine deaminase (AID) consensus motif, suggesting AID-induced mutations. When analyzing sequential samples, a clonal evolution was identified in half of the cHCL patients (6/12 pts). Among the 16 patients with HCL-like disorders, we observed an enrichment of <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations in vHCL/SDRPL (3/5 pts) and genes involved in the epigenetic regulation (<i>KDM6A, EZH2, CREBBP, ARID1A</i>) (3/5 pts). Furthermore, <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations were associated with a bad prognosis and a shorter time to next treatment (TTNT) and progression-free survival (PFS), independently of the HCL classification.	2022	07	16	Cancers (Basel)	Maitre	Elsa
35727053	10.1002/cncr.34348	Differential prognostic effect of systemic inflammation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy: A post hoc analysis of the phase 3 OAK trial.	A proinflammatory diathesis, as measured by the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), heralds an adverse disease course for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This post hoc analysis used data from the phase 3 OAK trial (NCT02008227), which randomized previously treated patients with NSCLC to atezolizumab or docetaxel. The main objective was assessing the differential impact of the pretreatment NLR on overall survival according to the treatment modality. In addition, patients' genomic characteristics were assessed according to their inflammatory status with a circulating free DNA (cfDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. In all, 600 and 575 patients with NLR data were included in the atezolizumab and docetaxel cohorts, respectively, with a median NLR of 4 (interquartile range, 2.6-6.7) for the pooled population. An NLR ≥4 was associated with a positive smoking status (88.6% vs. 78.1%; p &lt; .01), male sex (66.4% vs. 57.6%; p = .01), a worse performance status (71.3% vs. 55.2%; p &lt; .01), a higher number of metastatic sites (63.2% vs. 51.6%; p = .01), squamous histology (32.1% vs. 21.4%; p &lt; .01), and tissue KRAS mutations (30% vs. 18.7%; p = .02) but not with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression or the tissue epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status. A pretreatment NLR ≥4 was more strongly associated with mortality after atezolizumab (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.01) versus docetaxel (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.60; multivariable [MVA] interaction p = .08). The HR for an increased risk of death for PD-L1-negative/NLR ≥4 patients (compared with PD-L1-positive/NLR &lt;4 patients) was significantly higher in the atezolizumab cohort (MVA interaction p = .01). The exclusion of EGFR/ALK-positive patients further increased the prognostic ability of the baseline NLR in favor of atezolizumab (MVA interaction p = .02). Pretreatment cfDNA data from NGS showed that patients with a high blood tumor mutation burden (cutoff, 16 mut/Mb) had a higher median NLR (4.6 vs. 3.7; p = .01). After adjustments for multiple comparisons, none of the selected variants of interest (EGFR, KRAS, TP53, KEAP1, STK11, SMARCA4, ARID1A, and targeted DNA damage response and repair genes) were significantly associated with the NLR. A low baseline NLR identified patients with NSCLC who derived a greater survival benefit from atezolizumab in comparison with those identified in the docetaxel cohort. The NLR could complement PD-L1 expression in tailoring treatment in this setting.	2022	08	08	Cancer	Cortellini	Alessio
35794096	10.1038/s41467-022-31355-8	Clinical relevance of molecular characteristics in Burkitt lymphoma differs according to age.	While survival has improved for Burkitt lymphoma patients, potential differences in outcome between pediatric and adult patients remain unclear. In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25 ± 4% versus 6 ± 2%, p-value 0.0002). This identifies a promising molecular marker for relapse incidence in pediatric BL which will be used in future clinical trials.	2022	07	08	Nat Commun	Burkhardt	Birgit
35879731	10.1186/s40364-022-00401-4	Dynamic change of soluble interleukin-2 receptor distinguished molecular heterogeneity and microenvironment alterations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma with variable clinical outcomes and prediction of prognosis remains important for long-term remission. We performed serial serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) measurement pretreatment and before each cycle of the treatment in 599 patients with de novo DLBCL. Genomic and transcriptomic features were analyzed by 223 DNA- and 227 RNA-sequencing, respectively. Applying the cut-off value to sIL-2R pretreatment and cycle 2 (C2) level, patients were classified into FINE subtype (pretreatment low level) with good prognosis, RES subtype (pretreatment high level and C2 low level) with intermediate prognosis, and RET subtype (pretreatment high level and C2 high level) with poor prognosis, independent of International Prognostic Index. In ""others"" genetic subtype, dynamic change of sIL-2R showed prognostic significance and genetic features. Compared with FINE subtype, RES subtype had increased ARID1A and MYD88 mutations, and RET subtype had increased KMT2D, LYN and SOCS1 mutations. RES and RET subtypes showed significant enrichment in oncogenic pathways, such as ERK, NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and immune-associated pathways. As for tumor microenvironment, RES subtype exhibited increased recruiting activity of CD8 + T, T helper 1, and natural killer cells, and RET subtype with increased recruiting activity of CD4 + T and regulatory T cells in silico. There was a positive correlation between transcripts of IL-2R and immune checkpoint expressions including PD-1 and CTLA-4. Our findings identified that dynamic change of sIL-2R, with this simple and easy detection method in peripheral blood, had long-term prognostic effect and specific relation to microenvironment alterations in DLBCL.	2022	07	29	Biomark Res	Huo	Yu-Jia
36001451	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001956	Targeted Mutational Profiling Reveals Clonal Relationships in Metachronous Occurrence of Classic Hodgkin and Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphomas.	Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) patients may infrequently present with a prior or recurrent disease with discordant histology resembling non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These include primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or mediastinal gray-zone lymphoma (MGZL). Such patients are often refractory to standard therapy and their diagnosis is hampered by significant morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap and insufficient molecular data. Among 509 CHL patients seen at an academic medical center, 6 patients had a prior or subsequent diagnosis different from CHL. Paired tissue samples were evaluated by targeted mutational analysis using a 164-gene panel. Our findings show multiple shared variants indicative of a clonal relationship between the CHL and the PMBL, DLBCL, or MGZL diagnoses. Most frequent mutated genes included TNFAIP3 (4 of 6, 66.7%), STAT6 (3 or 6, 50%), ARID1A (3 of 6, 50%), and XPO1 (3 of 5, 60%). Three patients showed the same oncogenic variant within the XPO1 gene (E571K), and mutations in TNFAIP3 and B2M were observed in 2 of the 5 patients with shared variants. In addition, differences in the mutation profile between the lymphoma pairs were also observed, which could represent clonal evolution. Mutational profiling could be of benefit in patients with recurrent/refractory disease with discordant histology, where the clonal relationship could be helpful to inform and guide therapeutic decisions. These findings provide further evidence of a true biological continuum surrounding CHL, PMBL, DLBCL, and MGZL and shed light on underlying genetic events and their clinical impact.	2022	08	24	Am J Surg Pathol	Singh	Kunwar
33431788	10.1038/s41392-020-00437-8	CREBBP/EP300 mutations promoted tumor progression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through altering tumor-associated macrophage polarization via FBXW7-NOTCH-CCL2/CSF1 axis.	Epigenetic alterations play an important role in tumor progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the biological relevance of epigenetic gene mutations on tumor microenvironment remains to be determined. The core set of genes relating to histone methylation (KMT2D, KMT2C, EZH2), histone acetylation (CREBBP, EP300), DNA methylation (TET2), and chromatin remodeling (ARID1A) were detected in the training cohort of 316 patients by whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) and in the validation cohort of 303 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL by targeted sequencing. Their correlation with peripheral blood immune cells and clinical outcomes were assessed. Underlying mechanisms on tumor microenvironment were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Among all 619 DLBCL patients, somatic mutations in KMT2D (19.5%) were most frequently observed, followed by mutations in ARID1A (8.7%), CREBBP (8.4%), KMT2C (8.2%), TET2 (7.8%), EP300 (6.8%), and EZH2 (2.9%). Among them, CREBBP/EP300 mutations were significantly associated with decreased peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios, as well as inferior progression-free and overall survival. In B-lymphoma cells, the mutation or knockdown of CREBBP or EP300 inhibited H3K27 acetylation, downregulated FBXW7 expression, activated the NOTCH pathway, and downstream CCL2/CSF1 expression, resulting in tumor-associated macrophage polarization to M2 phenotype and tumor cell proliferation. In B-lymphoma murine models, xenografted tumors bearing CREBBP/EP300 mutation presented lower H3K27 acetylation, higher M2 macrophage recruitment, and more rapid tumor growth than those with CREBBP/EP300 wild-type control via FBXW7-NOTCH-CCL2/CSF1 axis. Our work thus contributed to the understanding of aberrant histone acetylation regulation on tumor microenvironment as an alternative mechanism of tumor progression in DLBCL.	2022	03	04	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Huang	Yao-Hui
33829512	10.1111/his.14378	Bcl-2-negative IGH-BCL2 translocation-negative follicular lymphoma of the thyroid differs genetically and epigenetically from Bcl-2-positive IGH-BCL2 translocation-positive follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL), comprising a minor subset of primary thyroid lymphomas, is divided into two groups based on Bcl-2 expression and IGH-BCL2 translocation. The clinicopathological features exhibited by Bcl-2-negative IGH-BCL2 translocation-negative FL of the thyroid (Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL) are different from those of conventional FL; however, its lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we collected samples from seven patients with Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL to investigate their epigenetic and genetic aberrations. The immunohistochemical profiles of epigenetic modifiers and the methylation status of histones were examined, including EZH2, MLL2/KMT2D, CBP/CREBBP, EP300, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL and Bcl-2-positive IGH-BCL2 translocation-positive FL of the thyroid (Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFL). Most Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs retained the positivity of epigenetic modifiers and lower expression of H3K27me3, although Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs exhibited aberrant immunohistochemical patterns of EZH2 and CBP/CREBBP and overexpression of H3K27me3. Samples from seven cases were further analysed using targeted sequencing, focusing on the exons of 409 key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs do not have pathogenic mutations of epigenetic modifiers, such as EZH2, MLL2/KMT2D, MLL3/KMT2C, EP300 and ARID1A, which have been reported in FLs in the literature, whereas Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs are probably pathogenic/pathogenic missense mutations or frameshift mutations of these genes. Additionally, novel mutations in TET2 and EP400 were detected in Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs. Different genetic and epigenetic abnormalities might be involved in the oncogenesis of Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs from Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs and other FLs.	2022	01	28	Histopathology	Hamamoto	Yuichiro
34039950	10.1038/s41408-021-00493-5	Genomic insights into the pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by whole-genome and targeted amplicon sequencing.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS) constitute a distinct clinicopathological entity in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. However, its genomic features remain sparsely characterized. Here, we combine whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted amplicon sequencing (tNGS), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) from 47 EBV + DLBCL (NOS) cases to delineate the genomic landscape of this rare disease. Integrated WGS and tNGS analysis clearly distinguished this tumor type from EBV-negative DLBCL due to frequent mutations in ARID1A (45%), KMT2A/KMT2D (32/30%), ANKRD11 (32%), or NOTCH2 (32%). WGS uncovered structural aberrations including 6q deletions (5/8 patients), which were subsequently validated by FISH (14/32 cases). Expanding on previous reports, we identified recurrent alterations in CCR6 (15%), DAPK1 (15%), TNFRSF21 (13%), CCR7 (11%), and YY1 (6%). Lastly, functional annotation of the mutational landscape by sequential gene set enrichment and network propagation predicted an effect on the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway (CSNK2A2, CARD10), IL6/JAK/STAT (SOCS1/3, STAT3), and WNT signaling (FRAT1, SFRP5) alongside aberrations in immunological processes, such as interferon response. This first comprehensive description of EBV + DLBCL (NOS) tumors substantiates the evidence of its pathobiological independence and helps stratify the molecular taxonomy of aggressive lymphomas in the effort for future therapeutic strategies.	2022	01	10	Blood Cancer J	Gebauer	Niklas
34070951	10.3390/diagnostics11060999	Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Cholangiocarcinoma.	The analysis of cfDNA has been applied as a liquid biopsy in several malignancies. However, its value in the diagnosis and prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have not been well defined. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic values of cfDNA level and tumor-specific mutation in circulating DNA (ctDNA) in CCA. The plasma cfDNA levels from 62 CCA patients, 33 benign biliary disease (BBD) patients and 30 normal controls were quantified by fluorescent assay. Targeted probe-based sequencing of 60 genes was applied for mutation profiling in 10 ctDNA samples and their corresponding treatment-naïve tissues. cfDNA levels in CCA were significantly higher than those in BBD and normal controls. We found that cfDNA levels at 0.2175 and 0.3388 ng/µL significantly discriminated CCA from healthy controls and BBD with 88.7 and 82.3% sensitivity and 96.7 and 57.6% specificity, respectively. cfDNA levels showed superior diagnostic efficacy in detecting CCA compared to CEA and CA19-9. <i>ARID1A</i> (30%), <i>PBRM1</i> (30%), <i>MTOR</i> (30%), and <i>FGFR3</i> (30%) mutations were the most common. Using nine frequently mutated genes in the ctDNA samples, the diagnostic accuracy of cfDNA sequencing was 90.8%, with 96.7% average sensitivity and 72.4% specificity. This study supports the use of cfDNA as a diagnosis and prognostic biomarker for CCA.	2021	06	27	Diagnostics (Basel)	Wintachai	Preawwalee
34348985	10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207441	Clinicopathological characteristics and genetic variations of uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours.	To investigate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours (UTROSCTs) and the value of molecular diversity in the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Five patients with UTROSCT were enrolled, and their clinical data, pathological morphologies, immunophenotypes and molecular features were analysed. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation for <i>NCOA1</i>, <i>NCOA2</i>, <i>NCOA3</i>, <i>JAZF1</i> and <i>PHF1</i> and next-generation sequencing for 27 homologous recombination/repair (HRR) pathway genes were performed on five and three UTROSCT specimens, respectively. All five patients were treated for abnormal uterine bleeding and grossly presented with intrauterine polyps. Under a microscope, tumour cells grew diffusely and presented a cordlike arrangement and glandular duct-like structures, with nuclei ranging from round to oval, vesicular chromatin and visible nucleoli in some cases. The mitotic count was less than 3/10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry showed sex cord, epithelial cell and smooth muscle cell biomarkers and diffuse, strong staining for B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2). <i>NCOA1</i> and <i>NCOA3</i> rearrangements were identified in 80% (4/5) of the cases. <i>JAZF1</i> and <i>PHF1</i> rearrangements were not detected in any of five patients. HRR pathway gene mutations were detected in all three patients, including <i>FANCE</i>, <i>ATR</i> and <i>ARID1A</i> mutations in one case each. UTROSCT is a rare mesenchymal tumour, and biopsy specimens are easily misdiagnosed. UTROSCT diagnosis requires the combined use of biomarkers and molecular detection. BCL-2 has potential diagnostic value as a marker. UTROSCT can have mutations related to the HRR pathway, suggesting that this tumour type may be sensitive to platinum/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.	2021	08	05	J Clin Pathol	Ye	Shan
31423576	10.1111/bjh.16159	M7-FLIPI is not prognostic in follicular lymphoma patients with first-line rituximab chemo-free therapy.	The clinical course of follicular lymphoma (FL) is highly variable. Recently the m7-FL international prognostic index (FLIPI) integrating performance status, FLIPI score and the mutational status of seven genes, was shown to stratify patients into ""low-risk"" and ""high-risk"" with respect to 5-year failure-free survival after first-line immunochemotherapy. Our aim was to evaluate the model after rituximab without chemotherapy. The Nordic Lymphoma Group performed two randomized clinical trials on indolent lymphoma patients receiving single rituximab and rituximab with interferon-α2a. In total, 95 FL patients had sufficient fresh-frozen diagnostic material for sequencing. A targeted panel for the genes EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP and CARD11 was utilized for m7-FLIPI score calculation. With a median follow-up of 10·6 years, 76% of patients were alive. No difference in time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as the interval between start of trial therapy and initiation of new therapy or death, nor overall survival (OS) was found between the m7-FLIPI risk groups (log-rank P = 0·94 and 0·99, respectively). EZH2 mutations were associated with longer TTF (log-rank P = 0·04) and in EP300 mutations were associated with shorter TTF (log-rank P = 0·01). We conclude that the prognostic value of the m7-FLIPI clinicogenetic model seems dependent on therapeutic regimen.	2020	08	05	Br J Haematol	Lockmer	Sandra
32083995	10.1200/JCO.19.02314	Genomic Landscape of Waldenström Macroglobulinemia and Its Impact on Treatment Strategies.	Next-generation sequencing has revealed recurring somatic mutations in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), including <i>MYD88</i> (95%-97%), <i>CXCR4</i> (30%-40%), <i>ARID1A</i> (17%), and <i>CD79B</i> (8%-15%). Deletions involving chromosome 6q are common in patients with mutated <i>MYD88</i> and include genes that modulate NFKB, BCL2, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), and apoptosis. Patients with wild-type <i>MYD88</i> WM show an increased risk of transformation and death and exhibit many mutations found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The discovery of <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> mutations in WM has facilitated rational drug development, including the development of BTK and CXCR4 inhibitors. Responses to many agents commonly used to treat WM, including the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, are affected by <i>MYD88</i> and/or <i>CXCR4</i> mutation status. The mutation status of both <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> can be used for a precision-guided treatment approach to WM.	2020	12	23	J Clin Oncol	Treon	Steven P

A 4-year-old female child developed cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis 6 months following a diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imaging revealed no evidence of systemic disease. Seven months later, the first systemic lesion was discovered on laryngoscopy. Restaging Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography at that time revealed new 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positive lesions in the left apical pleural margin, right lower peri-esophageal region, left ventricular myocardium, pancreas, upper pole of the left kidney, and inguinal and gluteal regions consistent with progressive systemic disease. Genomic testing revealed a low tumor mutational burden as well as mutations in KRAS G12A, ARID1A Q524, CDKN2A/B loss, and an alteration in NOTCH1.	2021	01	25	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Jansen	Chandler
32978169	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2147	EZH2-Targeted Therapies in Cancer: Hype or a Reality.	Next-generation genomic sequencing has identified multiple novel molecular alterations in cancer. Since the identification of DNA methylation and histone modification, it has become evident that genes encoding epigenetic modifiers that locally and globally regulate gene expression play a crucial role in normal development and cancer progression. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the enzymatic catalytic subunit of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that can alter gene expression by trimethylating lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27). EZH2 is involved in global transcriptional repression, mainly targeting tumor-suppressor genes. EZH2 is commonly overexpressed in cancer and shows activating mutations in subtypes of lymphoma. Extensive studies have uncovered an important role for EZH2 in cancer progression and have suggested that it may be a useful therapeutic target. In addition, tumors harboring mutations in other epigenetic genes such as <i>ARID1A, KDM6</i>, and <i>BAP1</i> are highly sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, thus increasing its potential as a therapeutic target. Recent studies also suggest that inhibition of EZH2 enhances the response to tumor immunotherapy. Many small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target EZH2 or the PRC2 complex, with some of these inhibitors now in early clinical trials reporting clinical responses with acceptable tolerability. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in targeting EZH2, its successes, and potential limitations, and we discuss the future directions of this therapeutic subclass.	2021	03	29	Cancer Res	Eich	Marie-Lisa
33252851	10.1002/ctm2.221	Influence of oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations on extranodal invasion in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive subtype of lymphoma, and multiple extranodal involvement (ENI) indicates adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations on ENI in DLBCL. The clinical features of 1960 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL were analyzed, and DNA and RNA sequencing was performed on 670 and 349 patients, respectively. Oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations were compared according to ENI and evaluated in zebrafish patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Multiple ENI was significantly associated with poor performance status, advanced stage, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, low response rate, and inferior prognosis. Lymphoma invasion of the bones, spleen, bone marrow, liver, and central nervous system were independent unfavorable prognostic factors. MYD88 was frequently mutated in patients with multiple ENI, co-occurred with mutations in CD79B, PIM1, TBL1XR1, BTG1, MPEG1, and PRDM1, and correlated with invasion of the bones, kidney/adrenal glands, breasts, testes, skin, and uterus/ovaries. For tumor microenvironment alterations, patients with multiple ENI showed higher regulatory T-cell (Treg)-recruiting activity, but lower extracellular matrix-encoding gene expression, than those without ENI and with single ENI. Elevated Treg-recruiting activity was related to mutations in B2M, SGK1, FOXO1, HIST1H1E, and ARID1A, and correlated with invasion of the bone marrow and thyroid. Additionally, mutations in MYD88, PIM1, TBL1XR1, SGK1, FOXO1, HIST1H1E, and ARID1A were associated with decreased major histocompatibility complex class I expression. Zebrafish models further revealed relationships between MYD88 mutations and invasion of the kidneys and gonads, as well as B2M mutations and invasion of the bone marrow. Increased CXCR4 expression is linked to bone marrow invasion in an organotropic way. Our findings thus contribute to an improved understanding of the biological behavior of multiple ENI and provide a clinical rationale for targeting ENI in DLBCL.	2020	12	07	Clin Transl Med	Shen	Rong
33376237	10.1038/s41392-020-00331-3	Combination of anti-PD-1 antibody with P-GEMOX as a potentially effective immunochemotherapy for advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma.	Advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTL) has demonstrated poor prognosis with currently available therapies. Here, we report the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody with the P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) regimen in advanced NKTL. Nine patients underwent six 21-day cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody (day 1), pegaspargase 2000 U/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1 and 8) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), followed by anti-PD-1 antibody maintenance every 3 weeks. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and genetic alterations were determined in paraffin-embedded pretreatment tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Responses were assessed using <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG-PET) and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients exhibited significant responses, comprising of seven complete remissions and one partial remission (overall response rate: 88.9%). After a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 6/9 patients (66.7%) remained in complete remission. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (33.3%), neutropenia (33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (33.3%); all of which were manageable and resolved. Immunochemotherapy produced a high response rate in patients with positive PD-L1 expression (5/6, 83.3%). NGS analysis suggested that STAT3/JAK3/PD-L1 alterations and ARID1A mutation were associated with immunochemotherapy efficacy. Mutation in DDX3X and alteration in epigenetic modifiers of KMT2D, TET2, and BCORL1 might indicate a poor response to immunochemotherapy. In conclusion, the anti-PD-1 antibody plus P-GEMOX regimen demonstrated promising efficacy in advanced NKTL. PD-L1 expression combined with specific genetic alterations could be used as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses to immunochemotherapy.	2021	10	13	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Cai	Jun
30886885	10.1016/j.gore.2019.02.007	Endometrial cancer arising after complete remission of uterine malignant lymphoma: A case report and mutation analysis.	Uterine malignant lymphoma is rare and its association with secondary cancer has not been fully described. Here, we report a rare case of endometrial cancer arising after 1 year of complete remission of uterine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). An 88-year-old woman was referred to us for abnormal genital bleeding and was diagnosed with uterine DLBCL. She underwent chemotherapy comprising rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone followed by radiation therapy; subsequently, she achieved complete remission. One year later, she noticed genital bleeding recurrence, and endometrial biopsy revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma. Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Her pathological diagnosis was endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, grade 1 (pT1aN0). Adenocarcinoma was observed over foamy macrophages aggregates, indicating remission of DLBCL. Targeted sequencing of both DLBCL and endometrial cancer revealed 24 gene mutations including the truncation-type mutations of <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>PTEN</i> occurring only in endometrial cancer. These multiple somatic gene mutations accumulating within 1 year imply endometrial carcinogenesis induced by DNA damages caused by treatment for DLBCL. Although the epidemiological risk of secondary malignancies after uterine lymphoma remains unclear, the present case serves as a warning for secondary cancer and highlights the importance of early detection and treatment.	2020	10	01	Gynecol Oncol Rep	Kuno	Ikumi
31123138	10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205727	Intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma: clinicopathological and integrated molecular analysis of two cases provides a clue to disease pathogenesis.	To elucidate the clinicopathological and molecular features of intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma (IVNKTCL). Two cases of IVNKTCL were retrieved from a single-centre cohort composed of 25 intravascular lymphomas. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry were performed. We identified somatic mutations in the following epigenetic regulators: four histone genes (<i>HIST1H2AN</i>, <i>HIST1H2BE</i>, <i>HIST1H2BN</i> and <i>H3F3A),</i> histone deacetylase (<i>HDAC5</i>), two helicases (<i>WRN</i> and <i>DDX3X</i>), two methylation-related enzymes (<i>TET2</i> and <i>DNMT1</i>) and the SNI/SWF pathway (<i>ARID1A</i>). Copy number analysis identified driver gene alterations comprising the loss of <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>HACE1</i> and <i>SMAD4</i>, and the gain of <i>SOX2</i> and histone clusters. RNA sequencing analysis did not indicate the presence of any fusion gene. Both cases were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and showed strong expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This study raises the possibility that, at least for some patients, IVNKTCL may be considered an epigenetic disease with EBV infection-associated aetiopathogenesis.	2019	09	03	J Clin Pathol	Fujikura	Kohei
31300419	10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029546	Sporadic and endemic Burkitt lymphoma have frequent <i>FOXO1</i> mutations but distinct hotspots in the AKT recognition motif.	FOXO1 has an oncogenic role in adult germinal center-derived lymphomas, in which mutations, predominately within the AKT recognition motif, cause nuclear retention of FOXO1, resulting in increased cell proliferation. To determine the prevalence and distribution of <i>FOXO1</i> mutations in pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL), we sequenced a large number of sporadic and endemic BL patient samples. We report a high frequency of <i>FOXO1</i> mutations in both sporadic and endemic BL at diagnosis, occurring in 23/78 (29%) and 48/89 (54%) samples, respectively, as well as 8/16 (50%) cases at relapse. Mutations of T24 were the most common in sporadic BL but were rare in endemic cases, in which mutations of residue S22, also within the AKT recognition motif, were the most frequent. <i>FOXO1</i> mutations were almost always present in the major tumor cell clone but were not associated with outcome. Analysis of other recurrent mutations reported in BL revealed that <i>FOXO1</i> mutations were associated with mutations of <i>DDX3X</i> and <i>ARID1A,</i> but not <i>MYC</i>, <i>TCF3</i>/<i>ID3,</i> or members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. We further show common nuclear retention of the FOXO1 protein, irrespective of mutation status, suggesting alternative unknown mechanisms for maintaining FOXO1 transcriptional activity in BL. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of <i>FOXO1</i> in an endemic cell line produced a significant decrease in cell proliferation, supporting an oncogenic role for <i>FOXO1</i> in endemic BL. Thus, <i>FOXO1</i> is frequently mutated in both sporadic and endemic BL and may offer a potential therapeutic target for pediatric BL patients worldwide.	2020	07	07	Blood Adv	Zhou	Peixun
31747604	10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.083	Targeting Excessive EZH1 and EZH2 Activities for Abnormal Histone Methylation and Transcription Network in Malignant Lymphomas.	Although global H3K27me3 reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, no effective therapeutic strategy for H3K27me3-high malignancies harboring EZH2<sup>WT/WT</sup> has yet been established. We explore epigenome and transcriptome in EZH2<sup>WT/WT</sup> and EZH2<sup>WT/Mu</sup> aggressive lymphomas and show that mutual interference and compensatory function of co-expressed EZH1 and EZH2 rearrange their own genome-wide distribution, thereby establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Direct comparison of leading compounds introduces potency and a mechanism of action of the EZH1/2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat). The synthetic lethality is observed in all lymphoma models and primary adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells. Opposing actions of EZH1/2-polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes are required for facultative heterochromatin formation. Inactivation of chromatin-associated genes (ARID1A, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCB1/SNF5, KDM6A/UTX, BAP1, KMT2D/MLL2) and oncovirus infection (HTLV-1, EBV) trigger EZH1/2 perturbation and H3K27me3 deposition. Our study provides the mechanism-based rationale for chemical dual targeting of EZH1/2 in cancer epigenome.	2020	09	21	Cell Rep	Yamagishi	Makoto
29307627	10.1016/j.humpath.2017.12.025	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma composed predominantly of rhabdoid/epithelioid cells: a frequently misdiagnosed highly aggressive variant.	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is one of the most common sarcoma types in adults with a predilection for the retroperitoneum. We have recently encountered 6 cases of DDL composed predominantly of rounded, rhabdoid or epithelioid cells mimicking rhabdoid melanoma, epithelioid rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients were 5 males and one female aged 64 to 81 years (median, 68). Tumors originated in the retroperitoneum (n=5; 3 in the psoas muscle) and deep soft tissue of the thigh (n=1). All 3 patients with follow-up died of metastatic disease within 4 to 8 months. Preoperative biopsy diagnoses never suggested dedifferentiated liposarcoma as a possibility; instead carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma were on top of suggestions. Five resected tumors were composed predominantly (70%-100%) of anaplastic rounded to oval rhabdoid cells with prominent central nucleoli and paranuclear rhabdoid inclusions. Bi- and multinucleation was a constant feature. The background stroma showed variable myxoid changes and minor mixed inflammatory cells. Two cases showed homologous dedifferentiation and another had sclerosing spindle cell nodule but a well-differentiated lipomatous component was not seen in any. One biopsied case showed solely monotonous small round blue cells with scattered rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of MDM2 (6/6), CDK4 (5/6), pancytokeratin AE/1AE3 (4/6) and diffusely desmin and myogenin (2/6). All cases showed high-level co-amplification of MDM2/CDK4 by in situ hybridization. The SWI/SNF complex components (SMARCB1, SMARCA2, SMARCA4, ARID1A and PBRM1) were intact in all cases. This highly aggressive liposarcoma variant needs to be distinguished from a variety of neoplasms including undifferentiated carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and others.	2019	04	09	Hum Pathol	Agaimy	Abbas
29486633	10.1177/1533034618754475	Loss of ARID1A Expression Correlates With Tumor Differentiation and Tumor Progression Stage in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.	Mutations in the AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene, which encodes a subunit of the Switch/Sucrose nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, can result in loss of protein expression and are associated with different cancers. Here, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the significance of AT-rich interactive domain 1A loss in 73 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases with paired paracancerous normal pancreatic tissues. The relationship between levels of the AT-rich interactive domain 1A protein product, BAF250a, and clinicopathological parameters in the 73 pancreatic cancer specimens was also analyzed. We found that the expression of AT-rich interactive domain 1A in normal pancreatic tissue was higher than that in tumor tissue. Loss of AT-rich interactive domain 1A expression in pancreatic tumors was associated with tumor differentiation ( P = .002) and tumor stage ( P = .048). Meanwhile, BAF250a protein levels were not related to lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, sex, or age and were not associated with survival. Transfection of the pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1 and PANC-1 with small-interfering RNA specific for AT-rich interactive domain 1A resulted in elevated messenger RNA and protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), CyclinD1, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS). The AT-rich interactive domain 1A expression level in the cells was increased following microRNA-31 (miR-31) inhibitor transfection. Our data provide additional evidence that AT-rich interactive domain 1A might function as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic carcinogenesis.	2019	04	01	Technol Cancer Res Treat	Zhang	Li
29669287	10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.078	ZRANB1 Is an EZH2 Deubiquitinase and a Potential Therapeutic Target in Breast Cancer.	Although EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors have shown antitumor effects in EZH2-mutated lymphoma and ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, many cancers do not respond because EZH2 can promote cancer independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. Here we identify ZRANB1 as the EZH2 deubiquitinase. ZRANB1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes EZH2. Depletion of ZRANB1 in breast cancer cells results in EZH2 destabilization and growth inhibition. Systemic delivery of ZRANB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to marked antitumor and antimetastatic effects in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Intriguingly, a small-molecule inhibitor of ZRANB1 destabilizes EZH2 and inhibits the viability of TNBC cells. In patients with breast cancer, ZRANB1 levels correlate with EZH2 levels and poor survival. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential for targeting the EZH2 deubiquitinase ZRANB1.	2019	09	17	Cell Rep	Zhang	Peijing
29989027	10.18632/oncotarget.25601	New generation sequencing of targeted genes in the classical and the variant form of hairy cell leukemia highlights mutations in epigenetic regulation genes.	Classical hairy cell leukemia (HCL-c) is a rare lymphoid neoplasm. <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation, detected in more than 80% of the cases, is described as a driver mutation, but additional genetic abnormalities appear to be necessary for the disease progression. For cases of HCL-c harboring a wild-type <i>BRAF</i> gene, the differential diagnosis of the variant form of HCL (HCL-v) or splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) is complex. We selected a panel of 21 relevant genes based on a literature review of whole exome sequencing studies (<i>BRAF</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, <i>DUSP2</i>, <i>MAPK15</i>, <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>EZH2</i>, <i>KDM6A</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>CDKN1B</i>, <i>XPO1</i>, <i>KLF2</i>, <i>CXCR4</i>, <i>NOTH1</i>, <i>NOTCH2</i>, <i>MYD88</i>, <i>ANXA1</i>, <i>U2AF1</i>, <i>BCOR</i>, and <i>ABCA8</i>). We analyzed 20 HCL-c and 4 HCL-v patients. The analysis of diagnostic samples mutations in <i>BRAF</i> (<i>n</i> = 18), <i>KLF2</i> (<i>n</i> = 4), <i>MAP2K1</i> (<i>n</i> = 3), <i>KDM6A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CDKN1B</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>ARID1A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CREBBP</i> (<i>n</i> = 2) <i>NOTCH1</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) and <i>ARID1B</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> was found in 90% (18/20) of HCL-c patients. In HCL-c patients with <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> , other mutations were found in 33% (6/18) of cases. All 4 HCL-v patients had mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes: <i>KDM6A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CREBBP</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) or <i>ARID1A</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). The analysis of sequential samples (at diagnosis and relapse) from 5 patients (2 HCL-c and 3 HCL-v), showed the presence of 2 new subclonal mutations (<i>BCOR<sup>E1430X</sup></i> and <i>XPO1<sup>E571K</sup></i> ) in one patient and variations of the mutated allele frequency in 2 other cases. In the HCL-v disease, we described new mutations targeting <i>KDM6A</i> that encode a lysine demethylase protein. This opens new perspectives for personalized medicine for this group of patients.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Maitre	Elsa
30134235	10.1159/000492835	Frequent Mutations in Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma.	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL-NT or NKTCL), with its aggressive nature and poor prognosis, has been widely studied to discover more effective treatment options. Various somatic gene alterations have been identified by traditional Sanger sequencing. However, recently, novel gene mutations in NKTCL have been revealed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, suggesting the potential for novel targeted therapies. This review discusses recurrent aberrations in NKTCL detected by NGS, which can be categorized into three main groups, specifically, tumor suppressors (TP53, DDX3X, and MGA), the JAK/STAT cascade, and epigenetic modifiers (KMT2D, BCOR, ARID1A, and EP300). Some epigenetic dysregulation and DDX3X mutation, which have been rarely identified by traditional sequencing technology, were recently uncovered with high frequencies by NGS. In this review, we summarize the mutational frequencies of various genes in NKTCL. In general, based on our analysis, BCOR is the most frequently mutated gene (16.9%), followed by TP53 (14.7%), and DDX3X (13.6%). The characterization of such genes provides new insight into the pathogenesis of this disease and indicates new biomarkers or therapeutic targets.	2018	09	18	Cell Physiol Biochem	Zhang	Yanjie

27872090	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1303	Mutational Landscape of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Current standard of care for patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is mainly effective, with high remission rates after treatment. However, the genetic perturbations that give rise to this disease remain largely undefined, limiting the ability to address resistant tumors or develop less toxic targeted therapies. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to interrogate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of 240 pediatric ALL cases with their matched remission samples. Commonly mutated genes fell into several categories, including RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors involved in lineage commitment, and the p53/cell-cycle pathway. Unique recurrent mutational hotspots were observed in epigenetic regulators CREBBP (R1446C/H), WHSC1 (E1099K), and the tyrosine kinase FLT3 (K663R, N676K). The mutant WHSC1 was established as a gain-of-function oncogene, while the epigenetic regulator ARID1A and transcription factor CTCF were functionally identified as potential tumor suppressors. Analysis of 28 diagnosis/relapse trio patients plus 10 relapse cases revealed four evolutionary paths and uncovered the ordering of acquisition of mutations in these patients. This study provides a detailed mutational portrait of pediatric ALL and gives insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.

28401006		Genomic and proteomic characterization of ARID1A chromatin remodeller in ampullary tumors.	<i>AT rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A)</i> is one of the most commonly mutated genes in a broad variety of tumors. The mechanisms that involve <i>ARID1A</i> in ampullary cancer progression remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the frequency of <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>KRAS</i> mutations in ampullary adenomas and adenocarcinomas and in duodenal adenocarcinomas from two cohorts of patients from Singapore and Romania, correlated with clinical and pathological tumor features, and assessed the functional role of <i>ARID1A</i>. In the ampullary adenocarcinomas, the frequency of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>ARID1A</i> mutations was 34.7% and 8.2% respectively, with a loss or reduction of ARID1A protein in 17.2% of the cases. <i>ARID1A</i> mutational status was significantly correlated with ARID1A protein expression level (P=0.023). There was a significant difference in frequency of <i>ARID1A</i> mutation between Romania and Singapore (2.7% versus 25%, P=0.04), suggestive of different etiologies. One somatic mutation was detected in the ampullary adenoma group. <i>In vitro</i> studies indicated the tumor suppressive role of <i>ARID1A</i>. Our results warrant further investigation of this chromatin remodeller as a potential early biomarker of the disease, as well as identification of therapeutic targets in <i>ARID1A</i> mutated ampullary cancers.	2020	09	30	Am J Cancer Res	Nastase	Anca
29025291	10.1556/650.2017.30868	[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and its individualized therapy options].	Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia is a form of lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma that preferentially localizes to the bone marrow and causes a special syndrome characterized by monoclonal IgM hypersecretion. Recent results point to the fact that this disease has at least three different pathobiological forms with different clinical presentation. While mutations of MYD88 occur in 95-97% of the cases, there are CXCR4 mutations in 30-40%, ARID1A mutations in 17% and CD79B mutations in approximately 10% of afflicted individuals. CXCR pathway signaling is able to transcriptionally silence tumor suppressors induced by MYD88 activation. Patients with mutated MYD88 and CXCR4 present with higher tumor burden, slower developing and less deep response upon therapy with more frequent resistance. In this review, based on the most recent data, a treatment selection advice is provided for the therapy of symptomatic patients.

29222279	10.1182/asheducation-2017.1.358	Follicular lymphoma: are we ready for a risk-adapted approach?	Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western hemisphere. The natural history of FL appears to have been favorably impacted by the introduction of rituximab after randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy induction has improved the overall survival. Yet, the disease is biologically and clinically heterogeneous with wide variations in outcomes for individual patients. The ability to accurately risk-stratify patients and then tailor therapy to the individual is an area of ongoing research. Historically, tumor grade, tumor burden, and the FL international prognostic index (version 1 and version 2) have been used to distinguish low-risk from high-risk patients. Biologic factors such as mutations in key genes can identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes to first-line therapy (mutational status of 7 genes [EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOX01, CREBBP, and CARD11] with Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index). More recently, the quality of the response to initial therapy, as measured by either PET imaging or by remission duration, has been show to identify individuals at high risk. However, several unmet needs remain, including a better ability to identify high-risk patients at diagnosis, the development of predictive biomarkers for targeted agents, and strategies to reduce the risk of transformation.	2018	07	18	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Kahl	Brad S

27102345	10.1038/modpathol.2016.79	Comprehensive genomic profiling of orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas identifies frequent alterations in MYD88 and chromatin modifiers: new routes to targeted therapies.	Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the orbit and ocular adnexa is the most common primary orbital malignancy. Treatments for low- (extra-nodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas) and high-grade (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) are associated with local and vision-threatening toxicities. High-grade lymphomas relapse frequently and exhibit poor survival rates. Despite advances in genomic profiling and precision medicine, orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas remain poorly characterized molecularly. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas obtained from a single-center using a panel targeting near-term, clinically relevant genes. Potentially actionable mutations and copy number alterations were prioritized based on gain- and loss-of-function analyses, and catalogued, approved, and investigational therapies. Of 36 informative samples, including marginal zone lymphomas (n=20), follicular lymphomas (n=9), and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=7), 53% harbored a prioritized alteration (median=1, range 0-5/sample). MYD88 was the most frequently altered gene in our cohort, with potentially clinically relevant hotspot gain-of-function mutations identified in 71% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 25% of marginal zone lymphomas. Prioritized alterations in epigenetic modulators were common and included gain-of-function EZH2 and loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (14% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 22% of follicular lymphomas contained alterations in each of these two genes). Single prioritized alterations were also identified in the histone methyltransferases KMT2B (follicular lymphoma) and KMT3B (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Loss-of-function mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma), CDKN2A (diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphoma), PTEN (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), ATM (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and NF1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and gain-of-function mutations in the oncogenes HRAS (follicular lymphoma) and NRAS (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were also observed. Together, our study demonstrates that NGS can be used to profile routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas for identification of somatic-driving alterations and nomination of potential therapeutic strategies.	2018	01	12	Mod Pathol	Cani	Andi K
27590521	10.18632/oncotarget.11773	Deep targeted sequencing in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia unveils distinct mutational patterns between genetic subtypes and novel relapse-associated genes.	To characterize the mutational patterns of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) we performed deep next generation sequencing of 872 cancer genes in 172 diagnostic and 24 relapse samples from 172 pediatric ALL patients. We found an overall greater mutational burden and more driver mutations in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients compared to B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. In addition, the majority of the mutations in T-ALL had occurred in the original leukemic clone, while most of the mutations in BCP-ALL were subclonal. BCP-ALL patients carrying any of the recurrent translocations ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL or TCF3-PBX1 harbored few mutations in driver genes compared to other BCP-ALL patients. Specifically in BCP-ALL, we identified ATRX as a novel putative driver gene and uncovered an association between somatic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway at ALL diagnosis and increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, we identified EP300, ARID1A and SH2B3 as relapse-associated genes. The genes highlighted in our study were frequently involved in epigenetic regulation, associated with germline susceptibility to ALL, and present in minor subclones at diagnosis that became dominant at relapse. We observed a high degree of clonal heterogeneity and evolution between diagnosis and relapse in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL, which could have implications for the treatment efficiency.	2018	05	22	Oncotarget	Lindqvist	C Mårten
27729836	10.5808/GI.2016.14.3.78	Mutational Analysis of Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma Using Targeted Sequencing with a Comprehensive Cancer Panel.	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL), is a malignant disorder of cytotoxic lymphocytes of NK or T cells. It is an aggressive neoplasm with a very poor prognosis. Although extranodal NKTCL reportedly has a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus, the molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has been unexplored. The recent technological advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made DNA sequencing cost- and time-effective, with more reliable results. Using the Ion Proton Comprehensive Cancer Panel, we sequenced 409 cancer-related genes to identify somatic mutations in five NKTCL tissue samples. The sequencing analysis detected 25 mutations in 21 genes. Among them, <i>KMT2D</i>, a histone modification-related gene, was the most frequently mutated gene (four of the five cases). This result was consistent with recent NGS studies that have suggested <i>KMT2D</i> as a novel driver gene in NKTCL. Mutations were also found in <i>ARID1A</i>, a chromatin remodeling gene, and <i>TP53</i>, which also recurred in recent NGS studies. We also found mutations in 18 novel candidate genes, with molecular functions that were potentially implicated in cancer development. We suggest that these genes may result in multiple oncogenic events and may be used as potential bio-markers of NKTCL in the future.	2020	09	30	Genomics Inform	Choi	Seungkyu
25444907	10.1016/j.canlet.2014.11.024	Gene mutations in primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts derived from non-small cell lung cancer.	Molecular annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are useful for the preclinical investigation of anticancer drugs and individualized anticancer therapy. We established 23 PDXs from 88 surgical specimens of lung cancer patients and determined gene mutations in these PDXs and their paired primary tumors by ultradeep exome sequencing on 202 cancer-related genes. The numbers of primary tumors with deleterious mutations in TP53, KRAS, PI3KCA, ALK, STK11, and EGFR were 43.5%, 21.7%, 17.4%, 17.4%, 13.0%, and 8.7%, respectively. Other genes with deleterious mutations in ≥3 (13.0%) primary tumors were MLL3, SETD2, ATM, ARID1A, CRIPAK, HGF, BAI3, EP300, KDR, PDGRRA and RUNX1. Of 315 mutations detected in the primary tumors, 293 (93%) were also detected in their corresponding PDXs, indicating that PDXs have the capacity to recapitulate the mutations in primary tumors. Nevertheless, a substantial number of mutations had higher allele frequencies in the PDXs than in the primary tumors, or were not detectable in the primary tumor, suggesting the possibility of tumor cell enrichment in PDXs or heterogeneity in the primary tumors. The molecularly annotated PDXs generated from this study could be useful for future translational studies. 	2015	04	21	Cancer Lett	Hao	Chuncheng
25779943	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2759	Genetics and Prognostication in Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Revelations from Deep Sequencing.	Mounting evidence supports the clinical significance of gene mutations and immunogenetic features in common mature B-cell malignancies. We undertook a detailed characterization of the genetic background of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), using targeted resequencing and explored potential clinical implications in a multinational cohort of 175 patients with SMZL. We identified recurrent mutations in TP53 (16%), KLF2 (12%), NOTCH2 (10%), TNFAIP3 (7%), MLL2 (11%), MYD88 (7%), and ARID1A (6%), all genes known to be targeted by somatic mutation in SMZL. KLF2 mutations were early, clonal events, enriched in patients with del(7q) and IGHV1-2*04 B-cell receptor immunoglobulins, and were associated with a short median time to first treatment (0.12 vs. 1.11 years; P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, mutations in NOTCH2 [HR, 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-4.4; P = 0.044] and 100% germline IGHV gene identity (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.05-4.55; P = 0.036) were independent markers of short time to first treatment, whereas TP53 mutations were an independent marker of short overall survival (HR, 2.36; 95 % CI, 1.08-5.2; P = 0.03). We identify key associations between gene mutations and clinical outcome, demonstrating for the first time that NOTCH2 and TP53 gene mutations are independent markers of reduced treatment-free and overall survival, respectively.	2016	08	02	Clin Cancer Res	Parry	Marina
25918285	10.1200/JCO.2014.59.2444	Genomic Characterization of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in African Americans by Targeted Massively Parallel Sequencing.	Technologic advances have enabled the comprehensive analysis of genetic perturbations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, African Americans have often been underrepresented in these studies. This ethnic group has higher lung cancer incidence and mortality rates, and some studies have suggested a lower incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Herein, we report the most in-depth molecular profile of NSCLC in African Americans to date. A custom panel was designed to cover the coding regions of 81 NSCLC-related genes and 40 ancestry-informative markers. Clinical samples were sequenced on a massively parallel sequencing instrument, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The study cohort included 99 patients (61% males, 94% smokers) comprising 31 squamous and 68 nonsquamous cell carcinomas. We detected 227 nonsilent variants in the coding sequence, including 24 samples with nonoverlapping, classic driver alterations. The frequency of driver mutations was not significantly different from that of whites, and no association was found between genetic ancestry and the presence of somatic mutations. Copy number alteration analysis disclosed distinguishable amplifications in the 3q chromosome arm in squamous cell carcinomas and pointed toward a handful of targetable alterations. We also found frequent SMARCA4 mutations and protein loss, mostly in driver-negative tumors. Our data suggest that African American ancestry may not be significantly different from European/white background for the presence of somatic driver mutations in NSCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using a comprehensive genotyping approach could identify numerous targetable alterations, with potential impact on therapeutic decisions.	2015	08	21	J Clin Oncol	Araujo	Luiz H
26192917	10.1038/ng.3358	Exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of DDX3X in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.	Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a malignant proliferation of CD56(+) and cytoCD3(+) lymphocytes with aggressive clinical course, which is prevalent in Asian and South American populations. The molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has largely remained elusive. We identified somatic gene mutations in 25 people with NKTCL by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed them in an extended validation group of 80 people by targeted sequencing. Recurrent mutations were most frequently located in the RNA helicase gene DDX3X (21/105 subjects, 20.0%), tumor suppressors (TP53 and MGA), JAK-STAT-pathway molecules (STAT3 and STAT5B) and epigenetic modifiers (MLL2, ARID1A, EP300 and ASXL3). As compared to wild-type protein, DDX3X mutants exhibited decreased RNA-unwinding activity, loss of suppressive effects on cell-cycle progression in NK cells and transcriptional activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Clinically, patients with DDX3X mutations presented a poor prognosis. Our work thus contributes to the understanding of the disease mechanism of NKTCL. 	2016	01	13	Nat Genet	Jiang	Lu
26256760	10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00169-2	Integration of gene mutations in risk prognostication for patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy for follicular lymphoma: a retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical trial and validation in a population-based registry.	Follicular lymphoma is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease, but the prognostic value of somatic mutations has not been systematically assessed. We aimed to improve risk stratification of patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy by integrating gene mutations into a prognostic model. We did DNA deep sequencing to retrospectively analyse the mutation status of 74 genes in 151 follicular lymphoma biopsy specimens that were obtained from patients within 1 year before beginning immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). These patients were recruited between May 4, 2000, and Oct 20, 2010, as part of a phase 3 trial (GLSG2000). Eligible patients had symptomatic, advanced stage follicular lymphoma and were previously untreated. The primary endpoints were failure-free survival (defined as less than a partial remission at the end of induction, relapse, progression, or death) and overall survival calculated from date of treatment initiation. Median follow-up was 7·7 years (IQR 5·5-9·3). Mutations and clinical factors were incorporated into a risk model for failure-free survival using multivariable L1-penalised Cox regression. We validated the risk model in an independent population-based cohort of 107 patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma considered ineligible for curative irradiation. Pretreatment biopsies were taken between Feb 24, 2004, and Nov 24, 2009, within 1 year before beginning first-line immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP). Median follow-up was 6·7 years (IQR 5·7-7·6). We established a clinicogenetic risk model (termed m7-FLIPI) that included the mutation status of seven genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP, and CARD11), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. In the training cohort, m7-FLIPI defined a high-risk group (28%, 43/151) with 5-year failure-free survival of 38·29% (95% CI 25·31-57·95) versus 77·21% (95% CI 69·21-86·14) for the low-risk group (hazard ratio [HR] 4·14, 95% CI 2·47-6·93; p&lt;0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 2·02), and outperformed a prognostic model of only gene mutations (HR 3·76, 95% CI 2·10-6·74; p&lt;0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 1·57). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival were 64% and 78%, respectively, with a C-index of 0·80 (95% CI 0·71-0·89). In the validation cohort, m7-FLIPI again defined a high-risk group (22%, 24/107) with 5-year failure-free survival of 25·00% (95% CI 12·50-49·99) versus 68·24% (58·84-79·15) in the low-risk group (HR 3·58, 95% CI 2·00-6·42; p&lt;0.0001). The positive predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival was 72% and 68% for negative predictive value, with a C-index of 0·79 (95% CI 0·69-0·89). In the validation cohort, risk stratification by m7-FLIPI outperformed FLIPI alone (HR 2·18, 95% CI 1·21-3·92), and FLIPI combined with ECOG performance status (HR 2·03, 95% CI 1·12-3·67). Integration of the mutational status of seven genes with clinical risk factors improves prognostication for patients with follicular lymphoma receiving first-line immunochemotherapy and is a promising approach to identify the subset at highest risk of treatment failure.

26415585	10.1038/ncomms9470	Genomic analyses reveal recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifiers and the JAK-STAT pathway in Sézary syndrome.	Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukaemia of mature T cells with poor prognosis and limited options for targeted therapies. The comprehensive genetic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of SS are unknown. Here we integrate whole-genome sequencing (n=6), whole-exome sequencing (n=66) and array comparative genomic hybridization-based copy-number analysis (n=80) of primary SS samples. We identify previously unknown recurrent loss-of-function aberrations targeting members of the chromatin remodelling/histone modification and trithorax families, including ARID1A in which functional loss from nonsense and frameshift mutations and/or targeted deletions is observed in 40.3% of SS genomes. We also identify recurrent gain-of-function mutations targeting PLCG1 (9%) and JAK1, JAK3, STAT3 and STAT5B (JAK/STAT total ∼11%). Functional studies reveal sensitivity of JAK1-mutated primary SS cells to JAK inhibitor treatment. These results highlight the complex genomic landscape of SS and a role for inhibition of JAK/STAT pathways for the treatment of SS.	2016	05	24	Nat Commun	Kiel	Mark J
26446488	10.1038/ncomms9325	LRF maintains genome integrity by regulating the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair.	Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) is a POZ/BTB and Krüppel (POK) transcriptional repressor characterized by context-dependent key roles in cell fate decision and tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate an unexpected transcription-independent function for LRF in the classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. We find that LRF loss in cell lines and mouse tissues results in defective cNHEJ, genomic instability and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Mechanistically, we show that LRF binds and stabilizes DNA-PKcs on DSBs, in turn favouring DNA-PK activity. Importantly, LRF loss restores ionizing radiation sensitivity to p53 null cells, making LRF an attractive biomarker to direct p53-null LRF-deficient tumours towards therapeutic treatments based on genotoxic agents or PARP inhibitors following a synthetic lethal strategy. 	2016	05	06	Nat Commun	Liu	Xue-Song
26468873	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005158	Distinct Viral and Mutational Spectrum of Endemic Burkitt Lymphoma.	Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is primarily found in children in equatorial regions and represents the first historical example of a virus-associated human malignancy. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and MYC translocations are hallmarks of the disease, it is unclear whether other factors may contribute to its development. We performed RNA-Seq on 20 eBL cases from Uganda and showed that the mutational and viral landscape of eBL is more complex than previously reported. First, we found the presence of other herpesviridae family members in 8 cases (40%), in particular human herpesvirus 5 and human herpesvirus 8 and confirmed their presence by immunohistochemistry in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. Second, we identified a distinct latency program in EBV involving lytic genes in association with TCF3 activity. Third, by comparing the eBL mutational landscape with published data on sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL), we detected lower frequencies of mutations in MYC, ID3, TCF3 and TP53, and a higher frequency of mutation in ARID1A in eBL samples. Recurrent mutations in two genes not previously associated with eBL were identified in 20% of tumors: RHOA and cyclin F (CCNF). We also observed that polyviral samples showed lower numbers of somatic mutations in common altered genes in comparison to sBL specimens, suggesting dual mechanisms of transformation, mutation versus virus driven in sBL and eBL respectively. 	2016	04	04	PLoS Pathog	Abate	Francesco
26473533	10.1038/bcj.2015.89	Mutation of chromatin modifiers; an emerging hallmark of germinal center B-cell lymphomas.	Subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas align with different stages of B-cell development. Germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) each share molecular similarities with normal GCB cells. Recent next-generation sequencing studies have gained insight into the genetic etiology of these malignancies and revealed a high frequency of mutations within genes encoding proteins that modifying chromatin. These include activating and inactivating mutations of genes that perform post-translational modification of histones and organize chromatin structure. Here, we discuss the function of histone acetyltransferases (CREBBP, EP300), histone methyltransferases (KDM2C/D, EZH2) and regulators of higher order chromatin structure (HIST1H1C/D/E, ARID1A and SMARCA4) that have been reported to be mutated in ⩾5% of DLBCL, FL or BL. Mutations of these genes are an emerging hallmark of lymphomas with GCB-cell origins, and likely represent the next generation of therapeutic targets for these malignancies. 	2016	01	25	Blood Cancer J	Lunning	M A
26551670	10.1038/ng.3444	Genomic profiling of Sézary syndrome identifies alterations of key T cell signaling and differentiation genes.	Sézary syndrome is a rare leukemic form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterized by generalized redness, scaling, itching and increased numbers of circulating atypical T lymphocytes. It is rarely curable, with poor prognosis. Here we present a multiplatform genomic analysis of 37 patients with Sézary syndrome that implicates dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoint and T cell signaling. Frequent somatic alterations were identified in TP53, CARD11, CCR4, PLCG1, CDKN2A, ARID1A, RPS6KA1 and ZEB1. Activating CCR4 and CARD11 mutations were detected in nearly one-third of patients. ZEB1, encoding a transcription repressor essential for T cell differentiation, was deleted in over one-half of patients. IL32 and IL2RG were overexpressed in nearly all cases. Our results demonstrate profound disruption of key signaling pathways in Sézary syndrome and suggest potential targets for new therapies. 	2016	06	21	Nat Genet	Wang	Linghua
24366360	10.1182/blood-2013-09-525808	The genomic landscape of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is characterized by highly recurring MYD88 and WHIM-like CXCR4 mutations, and small somatic deletions associated with B-cell lymphomagenesis.	The genetic basis for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) remains to be clarified. Although 6q losses are commonly present, recurring gene losses in this region remain to be defined. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 30 WM patients, which included germline/tumor sequencing for 10 patients. Validated somatic mutations occurring in &gt;10% of patients included MYD88, CXCR4, and ARID1A that were present in 90%, 27%, and 17% of patients, respectively, and included the activating mutation L265P in MYD88 and warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infection, and myelokathexis-syndrome-like mutations in CXCR4 that previously have only been described in the germline. WGS also delineated copy number alterations (CNAs) and structural variants in the 10 paired patients. The CXCR4 and CNA findings were validated in independent expansion cohorts of 147 and 30 WM patients, respectively. Validated gene losses due to CNAs involved PRDM2 (93%), BTG1 (87%), HIVEP2 (77%), MKLN1 (77%), PLEKHG1 (70%), LYN (60%), ARID1B (50%), and FOXP1 (37%). Losses in PLEKHG1, HIVEP2, ARID1B, and BCLAF1 constituted the most common deletions within chromosome 6. Although no recurrent translocations were observed, in 2 patients deletions in 6q corresponded with translocation events. These studies evidence highly recurring somatic events, and provide a genomic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of WM. 	2014	06	16	Blood	Hunter	Zachary R
24435047	10.1182/blood-2013-05-500264	Mutations in linker histone genes HIST1H1 B, C, D, and E; OCT2 (POU2F2); IRF8; and ARID1A underlying the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the western world. FL carries characteristic recurrent structural genomic aberrations. However, information regarding the coding genome in FL is still evolving. Here, we describe the results of massively parallel exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array genomic profiling of 11 highly purified FL cases, and 1 transformed FL case and the validation of selected mutations in 102 FL cases. We report the identification of 15 novel recurrently mutated genes in FL. These include frequent mutations in the linker histone genes HIST1H1 B-E (27%) and mutations in OCT2 (also known as POU2F2; 8%), IRF8 (6%), and ARID1A (11%). A subset of the mutations in HIST1H1 B-E affected binding to DNMT3B, and mutations in HIST1H1 B-E and in EZH2 or ARID1A were largely mutually exclusive, implicating HIST1H1 B-E in epigenetic deregulation in FL. Mutations in OCT2 (POU2F2) affected its transcriptional and functional properties as measured through luciferase assays, the biological analysis of stably transduced cell lines, and global expression profiling. Finally, multiple novel mutated genes located within regions of acquired uniparental disomy in FL are identified. In aggregate, these data substantially broaden our understanding of the genomic pathogenesis of FL. 	2014	05	09	Blood	Li	Hongxiu
23292937	10.1073/pnas.1205299110	Genetic heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of lymphoma in adults. The disease exhibits a striking heterogeneity in gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes, but its genetic causes remain to be fully defined. Through whole genome and exome sequencing, we characterized the genetic diversity of DLBCL. In all, we sequenced 73 DLBCL primary tumors (34 with matched normal DNA). Separately, we sequenced the exomes of 21 DLBCL cell lines. We identified 322 DLBCL cancer genes that were recurrently mutated in primary DLBCLs. We identified recurrent mutations implicating a number of known and not previously identified genes and pathways in DLBCL including those related to chromatin modification (ARID1A and MEF2B), NF-κB (CARD11 and TNFAIP3), PI3 kinase (PIK3CD, PIK3R1, and MTOR), B-cell lineage (IRF8, POU2F2, and GNA13), and WNT signaling (WIF1). We also experimentally validated a mutation in PIK3CD, a gene not previously implicated in lymphomas. The patterns of mutation demonstrated a classic long tail distribution with substantial variation of mutated genes from patient to patient and also between published studies. Thus, our study reveals the tremendous genetic heterogeneity that underlies lymphomas and highlights the need for personalized medicine approaches to treating these patients.	2013	03	21	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Zhang	Jenny
22585168	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0208	Molecular ontogeny of donor-derived follicular lymphomas occurring after hematopoietic cell transplantation.	The relative timing of genetic alterations that contribute to follicular lymphoma remains unknown. We analyzed a donor-recipient pair who both developed grade 2/3A follicular lymphoma 7 years after allogeneic transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions. Both patients harbored identical BCL2/IGH rearrangements also present in 1 in 2,000 cells in the donor lymphocyte infusion, and the same V(D)J rearrangement, which underwent somatic hypermutation both before and after clonal divergence. Exome sequencing of both follicular lymphomas identified 15 shared mutations, of which 14 (including alterations in EP300 and KLHL6) were recovered from the donor lymphocyte infusion by ultra-deep sequencing (average read coverage, 361,723), indicating acquisition at least 7 years before clinical presentation. Six additional mutations were present in only one follicular lymphoma and not the donor lymphocyte infusion, including an ARID1A premature stop, indicating later acquisition during clonal divergence. Thus, ultrasensitive sequencing can map clonal evolution within rare subpopulations during human lymphomagenesis in vivo. For the first time, we define the molecular ontogeny of follicular lymphoma during clonal evolution in vivo. By using ultrasensitive mutation detection, we mapped the time-course of somatic alterations after passage of a malignant ancestor by hematopoietic cell transplantation.	2013	01	15	Cancer Discov	Weigert	Oliver
22915242	10.1007/s00428-012-1303-2	ARID1A expression loss in gastric cancer: pathway-dependent roles with and without Epstein-Barr virus infection and microsatellite instability.	The AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene (ARID1A), which encodes one of the subunits in the Switch/Sucrose Nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, carries mutations and is responsible for loss of protein expression in gastric carcinoma, particularly with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and a microsatellite instability-high phenotype. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the significance of ARID1A loss in 857 gastric carcinoma cases, including 67 EBV(+) and 136 MLH1-lost gastric carcinomas (corresponding to a microsatellite instability-high phenotype). Loss of ARID1A expression was significantly more frequent in EBV(+) (23/67; 34 %) and MLH1-lost (40/136; 29 %) gastric carcinomas than in EBV(-)MLH1-preserved (32/657; 5 %) gastric carcinomas (P &lt; 0.01). Loss of ARID1A correlated with larger tumor size, advanced invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in EBV(-)MLH1-preserved gastric carcinoma. A correlation was found only with tumor size and diffuse-type histology in MLH1-lost gastric carcinoma, but no correlation was observed in EBV(+) gastric carcinoma. Loss of ARID1A expression in EBV(+) gastric carcinoma was highly frequent in the early stage of gastric carcinoma, although EBV infection did not cause downregulation of ARID1A: EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas (n = 8) and lymphomas (n = 15) failed to show loss of ARID1A, and EBV infection did not cause loss of ARID1A in gastric carcinoma cell lines. Taken together, loss of ARID1A may be an early change in carcinogenesis and may precede EBV infection in gastric epithelial cells, while loss of ARID1A promotes cancer progression in gastric cancer cells without EBV infection or loss of MLH1 expression. Loss of ARID1A has different and pathway-dependent roles in gastric carcinoma.	2012	12	31	Virchows Arch	Abe	Hiroyuki
22931316	10.1056/NEJMoa1200710	MYD88 L265P somatic mutation in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is an incurable, IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). The underlying mutation in this disorder has not been delineated. We performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells in 30 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the findings in samples from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy donors. Among the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a somatic variant (T→C) in LPL cells was identified at position 38182641 at 3p22.2 in the samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20 samples from patients with unpaired samples. This variant predicted an amino acid change (L265P) in MYD88, a mutation that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-κB signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3 patients with non-IgM-secreting LPL (91% of all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal tissue samples from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88 signaling reduced IκBα and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, as well as NF-κB nuclear staining, in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Somatic variants in ARID1A in 5 of 30 patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had wild-type MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2. MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia that can be useful in differentiating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from B-cell disorders that have some of the same features.

23091298	10.1182/blood-2012-06-437624	Targeted genomic sequencing of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma identifies recurrent alterations in antiapoptotic and chromatin-remodeling genes.	To ascertain the genetic basis of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (pBL), we performed clinical-grade next-generation sequencing of 182 cancer-related genes on 29 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded primary pBL samples. Ninety percent of cases had at least one mutation or genetic alteration, most commonly involving MYC and TP53. EBV(-) cases were more likely than EBV(+) cases to have multiple mutations (P &lt; .0001). Alterations in tumor-related genes not previously described in BL were identified. Truncating mutations in ARID1A, a member of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, were seen in 17% of cases. MCL1 pathway alterations were found in 22% of cases and confirmed in an expanded panel. Other clinically relevant genomic alterations were found in 20% of cases. Our data suggest the roles of MCL1 and ARID1A in BL pathogenesis and demonstrate that comprehensive genomic profiling may identify additional treatment options in refractory disease.	2013	02	15	Blood	Giulino-Roth	Lisa
23143597	10.1038/ng.2468	The genetic landscape of mutations in Burkitt lymphoma.	Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of MYC, but the contribution of other genetic mutations to the disease is largely unknown. Here, we describe the first completely sequenced genome from a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and germline DNA from the same affected individual. We further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that were recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Our data implicate a number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B, SALL3, FTCD and PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas and not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work thus elucidates commonly occurring gene-coding mutations in Burkitt lymphoma and implicates ID3 as a new tumor suppressor gene.	2013	02	13	Nat Genet	Love	Cassandra
21590771	10.1002/path.2911	Loss of BAF250a (ARID1A) is frequent in high-grade endometrial carcinomas.	Mutation of the ARID1A gene and loss of the corresponding protein BAF250a has recently been described as a frequent event in clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary. To determine whether BAF250a loss is common in other malignancies, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BAF250a was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) in more than 3000 cancers, including carcinomas of breast, lung, thyroid, endometrium, kidney, stomach, oral cavity, cervix, pancreas, colon and rectum, as well as endometrial stromal sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, sex cord-stromal tumours and four major types of lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma). We found that BAF250a loss is frequent in endometrial carcinomas but infrequent in other types of malignancies, with loss observed in 29% (29/101) of grade 1 or 2 and 39% (44/113) of grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium, 18% (17/95) of uterine serous carcinomas and 26% (6/23) of uterine clear cell carcinomas. Since endometrial cancers showed BAF250a loss, we stained whole tissue sections for BAF250a expression in nine cases of atypical hyperplasia and 10 cases of atypical endometriosis. Of the nine cases of complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia, all showed BAF250a expression; however, of 10 cases of atypical endometriosis (the putative precursor lesion for ovarian clear cell and endometrioid carcinoma), one case showed loss of staining for BAF250a in the atypical areas, with retention of staining in areas of non-atypical endometriosis. This was the sole case that recurred as an endometrioid carcinoma, indicating that BAF250a loss may be an early event in carcinogenesis. Since BAF250a loss is seen in endometrial carcinomas at a rate similar to that seen in ovarian carcinomas of clear cell and endometrioid type, and is uncommon in other malignancies, we conclude that loss of BAF250a is a particular feature of carcinomas arising from endometrial glandular epithelium.	2011	08	24	J Pathol	Wiegand	Kimberly C
19066270	10.1093/jnci/djn416	The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and glucocorticoid resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Glucocorticoids are used in the curative treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Resistance to glucocorticoids is an important adverse prognostic factor in newly diagnosed ALL patients but its mechanism is unknown. Because SWI/SNF complex-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for glucocorticoid transcriptional activity in vitro, we investigated whether expression of subunits of the SWI/SNF complex was related to glucocorticoid resistance in ALL. Gene expression and in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone and dexamethasone were assessed in a training set of primary ALL cells from 177 children with newly diagnosed ALL and a validation set of cells from an independent cohort of 95 ALL patients. The global test method was used to select pathways whose genes were associated with drug sensitivity. Genes involved in chromatin remodeling were identified by use of the Gene Ontology database. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down mRNA expression of SMARCA4 in glucocorticoid-sensitive Jurkat human ALL cells. Spearman rank correlation, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression were used to investigate associations between gene expression and glucocorticoid sensitivity. All statistical tests were two-sided. Statistically significant associations between decreased expression in ALL cells of genes for core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex-SMARCA4, ARID1A, and SMARCB1-and resistance to prednisolone and dexamethasone were identified in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, expression of SMARCA4 (P &lt; .001 and r = -0.43), ARID1A (P = .016 and r = -0.29), and SMARCB1 (P = .019 and r = -0.29) in ALL cells was statistically significantly associated with dexamethasone sensitivity, and SMARCA4 expression (P = .018 and r = -0.28) was statistically significantly associated with prednisolone sensitivity. Prednisolone resistance was higher in SMARCA4 shRNA-transfected Jurkat cells (drug concentration lethal to 50% of the leukemia cells [LC(50)] = 277 microM) than in control shRNA-transfected cells (LC(50) = 174 microM, difference = 103 microM, 95% confidence interval of the difference = 100 to 106 microM; P &lt; .001, t test). Decreased expression of as many as three subunits of the SWI/SNF complex appears to be associated with glucocorticoid resistance in primary ALL cells.	2009	01	06	J Natl Cancer Inst	Pottier	Nicolas
33788417	10.1002/pbc.29036	Novel risk factors for glucarpidase use in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Hispanic ethnicity, age, and the ABCC4 gene.	Carboxypeptidase G<sub>2</sub> (CPDG<sub>2</sub> ; glucarpidase) is a rescue drug for patients at risk for kidney injury from high-dose methotrexate (MTX). As there are no strategies for predicting patients who will require CDPG<sub>2</sub> , we evaluated the role of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors for CPDG<sub>2</sub> use. Cases who received CPDG<sub>2</sub> and controls who did not were identified by chart review of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received MTX doses between 1000 and 5000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> between 2010 and 2017. We used multivariable Bayesian logistic regression to evaluate the association of CPDG<sub>2</sub> use with demographic and clinical variables and, on a subset of patients, with genetic ancestry and 49 single nucleotide variants previously associated with MTX toxicity. We identified 423 patients who received 1592 doses of MTX. Of the 18 patients who received CPDG<sub>2</sub> , 17 (94%) were Hispanic. No patients who received 1000 or 2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of MTX received CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio: 4.68; 95% compatibility interval: 1.63-15.06) and older age (1.87 [1.17-3.17]) were associated with receiving CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Of the 177 patients in the genomic cohort, 11 received CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Each additional G allele of rs7317112 in ABCC4 increased the odds of requiring CPDG<sub>2</sub> (3.10 [1.12-6.75]). Six other loci (NTRK1/rs10908521, TSG1/rs9345389, STT3B/rs1353327, SCLO1B1/rs4149056, GATA3/rs3824662, ARID5B/rs10821936) demonstrated probabilities of association between 88% and 97%. We demonstrated that demographic characteristics, including Hispanic ethnicity and age, are associated with CPDG<sub>2</sub> use. Additionally, we provide evidence that inherited genetic variation is associated with risk of requiring CPDG<sub>2</sub> . If validated in independent populations, this information could be leveraged to develop targeted toxicity prevention strategies for children with ALL.	2022	03	11	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Zobeck	Mark C
33891562	10.18632/aging.202903	Age-related differences of genetic susceptibility to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Inherited predispositions to acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been well investigated in pediatric patients, but studies on adults, particularly Chinese patients, are limited. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 466 all-age Chinese patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1,466 non-ALL controls to estimate the impact of age on ALL susceptibility in the Chinese population. Among the 17 reported loci, 8 have been validated in pediatric and 1 in adult patients. The strongest association signal was identified at <i>ARID5B</i> locus and gradually decreased with age, while the signal at <i>GATA3</i> exhibited the opposite trend and significantly impact on adult patients. With genome-wide approaches, germline variants at 2q14.3 rank as the top inherited predisposition to adult patients (e.g., rs73956024, <i>P</i> = 4.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and separate the genetic risk of pediatric vs. adult patients (<i>P</i> = 3.6 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), whereas variants at 15q25.3 (e.g., rs11638062) have a similar impact on patients in different age groups (overall <i>P</i> = 2.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Our analysis highlights the impact of age on genetic susceptibility to ALL in Chinese patients.	2021	07	26	Aging (Albany NY)	Hao	Qing
31573954	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0190	<i>ARID5B</i> Influences Antimetabolite Drug Sensitivity and Prognosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Treatment outcomes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved steadily, but a significant proportion of patients still experience relapse due to drug resistance, which is partly explained by inherited and/or somatic genetic alternations. Recently, we and others have identified genetic variants in the <i>ARID5B</i> gene associated with susceptibility to ALL and also with relapse. In this study, we sought to characterize the molecular pathway by which ARID5B affects antileukemic drug response in patients with ALL. We analyzed association of ARID5B expression in primary human ALL blasts with molecular subtypes and treatment outcome. Subsequent mechanistic studies were performed in ALL cell lines by manipulating <i>ARID5B</i> expression isogenically, in which we evaluated drug sensitivity, metabolism, and molecular signaling events. <i>ARID5B</i> expression varied substantially by ALL subtype, with the highest level being observed in hyperdiploid ALL. Lower <i>ARID5B</i> expression at diagnosis was associated with the risk of ALL relapse, and further reduction was noted at ALL relapse. In isogenic ALL cell models <i>in vitro</i>, <i>ARID5B</i> knockdown led to resistance specific to antimetabolite drugs (i.e., 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate), without significantly affecting sensitivity to other antileukemic agents. <i>ARID5B</i> downregulation significantly inhibited ALL cell proliferation and caused partial cell-cycle arrest. At the molecular level, the cell-cycle checkpoint regulator p21 (encoded by <i>CDKN1A</i>) was most consistently modulated by ARID5B, plausibly as its direct transcription regulation target. Our data indicate that ARID5B is an important molecular determinant of antimetabolite drug sensitivity in ALL, in part, through p21-mediated effects on cell-cycle progression.	2020	10	01	Clin Cancer Res	Xu	Heng
31704777	10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106339	Novel phenotypes observed in patients with <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia/familial thrombocytopenia syndrome and a biallelic <i>ARID5B</i> risk allele as leukaemogenic cofactor.	<i>Background.</i> The phenotypes of patients with the recently discovered, dominant, <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome are variable, and the exact mechanism of leukaemogenesis remains unclear. <i>Patients and Methods.</i> Here, we present novel clinical and laboratory phenotypes of seven individuals from three families with <i>ETV6</i> germline mutations and a refined genetic analysis of one child with additional high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL), aiming to elucidate second oncogenic hits. <i>Results.</i> Four individuals from two pedigrees harboured one novel or one previously described variant in the central domain of <i>ETV6</i> (c.592C&gt;T, p.Gln198* or c.641C&gt;T, p.Pro241Leu, respectively). Neutropenia was an accompanying feature in one of these families that also harboured a variant in <i>RUNX1</i> (c.1098_1103dup, p.Ile366_Gly367dup), while in the other, an autism-spectrum disorder was observed. In the third family, the index patient suffered from HD-ALL and life-threatening pulmonary mucor mycosis, and had a positive family history of 'immune' thrombocytopenia. Genetic analyses revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the ETS domain of <i>ETV6</i> (c.1136T&gt;C, p.Leu379Pro) along with absence of heterozygosity of chromosome (10)(q21.2q21.3), yielding a biallelic leukaemia risk allele in <i>ARID5B</i> (rs7090445-C). The neutrophil function was normal in all individuals tested, and the platelet immune histochemistry of all three pedigrees showed delta-storage-pool defect-like features and cytoskeletal defects. <i>Conclusions.</i> Our clinical observations and results of high-resolution genetic analyses extend the spectrum of possible phenotypes cosegregating with <i>ETV6</i> germline mutations. Further, we propose <i>ARID5B</i> as potential leukaemogenic cofactor in patients with <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome.	2021	06	08	J Med Genet	Karastaneva	Anna
31870219	10.1080/08880018.2019.1705949	Association of <i>ABCC2</i> with levels and toxicity of methotrexate in Malaysian Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).	Studies had shown that genetic polymorphism plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics variation of high dose methotrexate (MTX), 5000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> regimen. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic variations associated with the serum level and toxicity of MTX in Malaysian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thirty-eight patients were genotyped for rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>), rs4948496 (<i>ARID5B</i>), rs1801133 (<i>MTHFR</i>) and rs4149056 (<i>SLCO1B1</i>). Serum levels of MTX at 48 h post 24 h of intravenous infusion were analyzed by high<i>-</i>performance liquid chromatography<i>-</i>mass spectrometry. The <i>ABCC2</i> genotype was significantly associated with the serum levels of MTX at 48 h after treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Patients with CT and TT of rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>) and TC and CC of rs4948496 (<i>ARID5B</i>) were significantly associated with leukopenia grade I-IV (Fisher Exact Test; <i>p</i> = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). The three most common MTX related toxicities were leukopenia (60.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase enzyme (47.4%), and thrombocytopenia (47.4%). Our results demonstrate that by prescreening of patients for <i>ABCC2</i> and <i>ARID5B</i> associated with the serum levels and adverse effects of MTX would identify patients at risk and therefore help a pediatric oncologist to personalize chemotherapy drugs for precision health.	2020	11	13	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Razali	Rizal Husaini
32488880	10.1002/jcla.23414	Association of TLX1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Han Chinese children.	Studies on gene polymorphism association are centered on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a common hematological malignancy in children younger than 16 years. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some genes, such as ARID5B and CDKN2B, are associated with the risk of childhood ALL. T-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1), a member of the HOX gene family, was identified based on its abnormal expression in T-lineage leukemia. This study aimed to determine whether TLX1 is associated with B-ALL and which SNP plays a significant role in ALL. A total of 217 cases of ALL and 241 controls were included in this study. Six tag SNPs (rs75329544, rs946328, rs12415670, rs2075879, rs17113735, and rs1051723) were selected, and genotyping was carried out on Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Rs17113735 was possibly the risk locus associated with increased risk for ALL, whereas rs946328 was possibly associated with decreased risk for ALL. Moreover, rs17113735 was likely to be the risk locus for B-cell ALL (B-ALL), and rs2075879 was associated with decreased risk for B-ALL (P &lt; .05). All SNPs in the two sample types (ALL and B-ALL samples) demonstrated linkage disequilibrium except between rs75329544 and rs2075879. Haplotype analysis showed no significant difference between the cases and controls in the two sample types. TLX1 gene polymorphisms are associated with ALL (rs17113735 and rs946328) and possibly play a significant role in B-ALL (rs17113735 and rs2075879). This work provides a reference for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.	2021	07	05	J Clin Lab Anal	Mei	Endian
30770347	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0801	Is There Etiologic Heterogeneity between Subtypes of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? A Review of Variation in Risk by Subtype.	Although substantial advances in the identification of cytogenomic subtypes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been made in recent decades, epidemiologic research characterizing the etiologic heterogeneity of ALL by subtype has not kept pace. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning subtype-specific epidemiologic risk factor associations with ALL subtype defined by immunophenotype (e.g., B-cell vs. T-cell) and cytogenomics (including gross chromosomal events characterized by recurring numerical and structural abnormalities, along with cryptic balanced rearrangements, and focal gene deletions). In case-control analyses investigating nongenetic risk factors, home paint exposure is associated with hyperdiploid, <i>MLL</i>-rearranged, and <i>ETV6</i>-<i>RUNX1</i> subtypes, yet there are few differences in risk factor associations between T- and B-ALL. Although the association between maternal smoking and ALL overall has been null, maternal smoking is associated with an increasing number of gene deletions among cases. GWAS-identified variants in <i>ARID5B</i> have been the most extensively studied and are strongly associated with hyperdiploid B-ALL. <i>GATA3</i> single nucleotide variant rs3824662 shows a strong association with Ph-like ALL (OR = 3.14). However, there have been relatively few population-based studies of adequate sample size to uncover risk factors that may define etiologic heterogeneity between and within the currently defined cytogenomic ALL subtypes.	2020	07	16	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Williams	Lindsay A
30810385	10.1089/gtmb.2018.0283	Association of ARID5B and IKZF1 Variants with Leukemia from Northern India.	Leukemia is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by elevated proliferation of white blood cells. Various genetic studies have assessed the contributory roles of several single nucleotide polymorphisms with the development of leukemia. The role of genetic variation in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes has previously been identified in various population groups; however, the role of these variants in the north Indian populations of Jammu and Kashmir is unknown. In this study, we explored the association of the newly identified genetic variants, rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1, with leukemic patients from Jammu and Kashmir of northern India. The variants were genotyped using TaqMan allele discrimination assays for 616 individuals (210 leukemic cases and 406 healthy controls). The association of each SNP with the disease was evaluated using logistic regression. It was observed that the variants rs6964823 (IKZF1) and rs10740055 (ARID5B) showed significant associations with odds ratio (OR) and p-values of 1.5 (1.0-2.3 at 95% confidence interval [CI]) and 0.04; and 2.5 (1.5-4.1 at 95% CI) and 0.0002, respectively. We also evaluated the cumulative effect for both the variants by combining the risk genotypes and obtained and OR of 4.9. It was found that the variants rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1 act individually and additively as risk factors in the development of leukemia in the populations of Jammu and Kashmir in Northern India.	2019	05	21	Genet Test Mol Biomarkers	Bhat	Amrita
31076442	10.1182/blood.2018874503	The enhancer RNA <i>ARIEL</i> activates the oncogenic transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 regulates the transcriptional program in T-ALL. ARID5B is one of the critical downstream targets of TAL1, which further activates the oncogenic regulatory circuit in T-ALL cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular functions of the noncoding RNA, ARID5B-inducing enhancer associated long noncoding RNA (<i>ARIEL</i>), in T-ALL pathogenesis. We demonstrated that <i>ARIEL</i> is specifically activated in <i>TAL1</i> <sup>+</sup> T-ALL cases, and its expression is associated with <i>ARID5B</i> enhancer activity. <i>ARIEL</i> recruits mediator proteins to the <i>ARID5B</i> enhancer, promotes enhancer-promoter interactions, and activates the expression of <i>ARID5B</i>, thereby positively regulating the TAL1-induced transcriptional program and the <i>MYC</i> oncogene. The TAL1 complex coordinately regulates the expression of <i>ARIEL</i> Knockdown of <i>ARIEL</i> inhibits cell growth and survival of T-ALL cells in culture and blocks disease progression in a murine xenograft model. Our results indicate that <i>ARIEL</i> plays an oncogenic role as an enhancer RNA in T-ALL.	2020	01	14	Blood	Tan	Shi Hao
31111395	10.1007/s12185-019-02658-2	ARID5B gene polymorphisms and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.	Genome-wide association studies have implicated several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) gene in children with ALL; however, whether ARID5B variants (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) are associated with childhood ALL remains controversial. We performed this study to obtain more conclusive results. Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 26 studies were included. Analyses stratified by ethnicity revealed that three polymorphisms are significantly associated with the odds of childhood ALL in Caucasians, and rs10994982 and rs7089424 with the odds of childhood ALL in Asian populations. Furthermore, subtype analyses provided strong evidence that the three polymorphisms are highly associated with the risk of B-cell ALL. Our findings indicate that the ARID5B variants (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) are significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL.	2019	12	11	Int J Hematol	Yang	Ju-Le
31221981	10.1038/s12276-019-0230-6	The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.	Recent studies on mutations in cancer genomes have distinguished driver mutations from passenger mutations, which occur as byproducts of cancer development. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) project identified 299 genes and 24 pathways/biological processes that drive tumor progression (Cell 173: 371-385 e318, 2018). Of the 299 driver genes, 12 genes are involved in histones, histone methylation, and demethylation (Table 1). Among these 12 genes, those encoding the histone demethylases JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A were identified as cancer driver genes. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH)1/2, drive tumor progression by producing an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which is a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate, O<sub>2</sub>-dependent dioxygenases such as Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases, and DNA demethylases. Studies on oncometabolites suggest that histone demethylases mediate metabolic changes in chromatin structure. We have reviewed the most recent findings regarding cancer-specific metabolic reprogramming and the tumor-suppressive roles of JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A. We have also discussed mutations in other isoforms such as the JARID1A, 1B, 1D of KDM5 subfamilies and the JMJD3/KDM6B of KDM6 subfamilies, which play opposing roles in tumor progression as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer cell type.

31227872	10.1007/s00277-019-03730-x	Variants in ARID5B gene are associated with the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Mexican children.	A high impact of ARID5B SNPs on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility has been described in Hispanic children; therefore, it is relevant to know if they influence the high incidence of childhood-ALL in Mexicans. Seven SNPs (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, rs4948488) of ARID5B were analyzed in 384 controls and 298 ALL children using genomic DNA and TaqMan probes. The SNPs were analyzed for deviation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotypic and allelic frequencies between controls and patients. The association between SNPs and ALL susceptibility was calculated, and haplotype and ancestry analyses were conducted. All SNPs were associated with ALL, pre-B ALL, and hyperdiploid-ALL susceptibility (p &lt; 0.05). No association with T-ALL and gene fusions was found (p &gt; 0.05). The seven SNPs were associated with risk of pre-B ALL in younger children; however, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, and rs4948488 were not associated with susceptibility in older children and adolescents. The CAG haplotype (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) was strongly associated with ALL risk in our population (p &lt; 0.00001). The frequency of all risk alleles in our ALL, pre-B, and hyperdiploid-ALL patients was higher than that in Hispanic children reported. This is the first report showing the association between rs2393732, rs2393782, and rs4948488 with pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL children. The G allele at rs2893881 confers major risk for pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL in Mexican (OR, 2.29) than in Hispanic children (OR, 1.71). The genetic background of our population could influence the susceptibility to ALL and explain its high incidence in Mexico.	2019	09	17	Ann Hematol	Reyes-León	Adriana
31274788	10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000038	Genetic polymorphisms of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 are associated with B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Chinese pediatric population.	Several ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were confirmed to be significantly associated with the susceptibility of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on Caucasian populations in previous studies. Similar investigations in Asian populations were less. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between ARID5B SNPs rs7089424, rs10994982, and the risk of ALL in Chinese pediatric population. A total of 190 pediatric ALL patients and 270 controls were enrolled in this study. PCR amplification combined with mass spectrometry were used to evaluate the genotypes of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982. χ test was used in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the SNPs for analyzing statistical differences between patients and controls. There were significant differences in the risk allele frequencies of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 between B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients and controls (rs7089424, G allele: p = 0.001; rs10994982, A allele: p = 0.000). The genotype distributions of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 were also statistically different in B-ALL patients compared with controls (rs7089424, p = 0.004; rs10994982, p = 0.001). Further analyzing the relevance of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 genotypes to clinical risk classification of ALL showed GG genotype of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 were strikingly correlated with the medium-risk and low-risk groups of B-ALL. Finally, GG and GT genotypes of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 seemed to be responsible for the hyperdiploid subtype susceptibility of childhood B-ALL. ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 might serve as genetic susceptibility markers for B-ALL in Chinese pediatric population. Moreover, the two ARID5B SNPs are associated with the risk of B-hyperdiploid ALL, which had a better therapeutic response than other ALL subtypes.	2020	06	23	J Chin Med Assoc	Tao	Ran
31350265	10.1182/blood.2018890764	Inherited genetic susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome.	Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 20-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and distinct somatic features, including CRLF2 rearrangement in ∼50% of cases; however, the role of inherited genetic variation in DS-ALL susceptibility is unknown. We report the first genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, comprising a meta-analysis of 4 independent studies, with 542 DS-ALL cases and 1192 DS controls. We identified 4 susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance: rs58923657 near IKZF1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; Pmeta = 5.32 × 10-15), rs3731249 in CDKN2A (OR, 3.63; Pmeta = 3.91 × 10-10), rs7090445 in ARID5B (OR, 1.60; Pmeta = 8.44 × 10-9), and rs3781093 in GATA3 (OR, 1.73; Pmeta = 2.89 × 10-8). We performed DS-ALL vs non-DS ALL case-case analyses, comparing risk allele frequencies at these and other established susceptibility loci (BMI1, PIP4K2A, and CEBPE) and found significant association with DS status for CDKN2A (OR, 1.58; Pmeta = 4.1 × 10-4). This association was maintained in separate regression models, both adjusting for and stratifying on CRLF2 overexpression and other molecular subgroups, indicating an increased penetrance of CDKN2A risk alleles in children with DS. Finally, we investigated functional significance of the IKZF1 risk locus, and demonstrated mapping to a B-cell super-enhancer, and risk allele association with decreased enhancer activity and differential protein binding. IKZF1 knockdown resulted in significantly higher proliferation in DS than non-DS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate a higher penetrance of the CDKN2A risk locus in DS and serve as a basis for further biological insights into DS-ALL etiology.	2020	02	03	Blood	Brown	Austin L

We investigated the association between the <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 C &gt; T, rs10994982 A &gt; G, and susceptibility to ALL in a cohort of Egyptian individuals and investigated their role in relation to disease outcome. Real-time PCR typing was done for <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and rs10994982 SNPs for 128 pediatric ALL (pALL), 45 adult ALL (aALL), and 436 healthy controls. Significant risk associations were found between the C allele (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.02), CC genotype (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.72), CT genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.011, OR = 1.45) of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and pediatric ALL especially T-ALL and adult ALL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The CA haplotype (C allele of rs10821936 + A allele of rs10994982) was associated with the risk of ALL either pediatric ALL or adult ALL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In the studied Egyptian population, it can be concluded that the C allele, CC, and CT genotypes of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and the CA haplotype may be a susceptibility risk factor for pediatric and adult ALL. However, the SNPs of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and rs10994982 were not found to be strongly associated with ALL outcomes.	2020	04	09	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Mosaad	Youssef M

29335448	10.1038/s41598-017-19127-7	Regional evaluation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia genetic susceptibility loci among Japanese.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed mostly in populations of European and Hispanic ancestry have confirmed an inherited genetic basis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but these associations are less clear in other races/ethnicities. DNA samples from ALL patients (aged 0-19 years) previously enrolled onto a Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group trial were collected during 2013-2015, and underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping resulting in 527 B-cell ALL for analysis. Cases and control data for 3,882 samples from the Nagahama Study Group and Aichi Cancer Center Study were combined, and association analyses across 10 previous GWAS-identified regions were performed after targeted SNP imputation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in Japanese and other populations were evaluated using the varLD score based on 1000 Genomes data. Risk associations for ARID5B (rs10821936, OR = 1.84, P = 6 × 10<sup>-17</sup>) and PIP4K2A (rs7088318, OR = 0.76, P = 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) directly transferred to Japanese, and the IKZF1 association was detected by an alternate SNP (rs1451367, OR = 1.52, P = 2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Marked regional LD differences between Japanese and Europeans was observed for most of the remaining loci for which associations did not transfer, including CEBPE, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and ELK3. This study represents a first step towards characterizing the role of genetic susceptibility in childhood ALL risk in Japanese.	2018	11	20	Sci Rep	Urayama	Kevin Y
29504848	10.1080/08916934.2018.1446525	Signalling pathways identified in salivary glands from primary Sjögren's syndrome patients reveal enhanced adipose tissue development.	A characteristic feature of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is the destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands mediated by mononuclear cell infiltration. Adipocytes can also occupy a large portion of the salivary gland (SG) tissue area, although little is known about their significance in pSS. We have previously investigated adipose tissue infiltration in SG biopsies from pSS patients and non-SS sicca controls. Our findings indicated the distinct incidence of adipose tissue replacement in pSS patients, where adipocytes were detected in interleukin (IL) 6 rich regions. We now aimed to examine the development of adipocytes in the SG microenvironment, and delineate their possible involvement in immune reactions. A microarray analysis was performed on SG from 6 pSS patients and 6 non-SS controls, where the expression levels of genes involved in adipose tissue development, inflammatory responses, and lymphoma development were assessed. Real-time PCR was carried out on SG from 14 pSS patients and 15 non-SS controls to account for IL6, IL10, and IL17 mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen SG tissue using IL17 was also conducted. Our results indicate signalling pathways identified in SG of pSS patients displayed genes leading to prominent adipose tissue development and reduced mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (ARID5B, OXCT1, BDH1, SOX8, HMGCS2, FTO, ECHS1, PCCA, ACADL and ACADVL), inflammatory responses (IL1R1, IL7R, IL10RA, IL15, IL18RAP, CCL2, CCL5, CCL22, CXCR6, CD14, and CD48), and lymphoma development via JAK-STAT signalling (STAT2, TYK2, EBI3, FAS, TNFRSF1B, MAP3K8, HMOX1, LTB, TNF, STAT1, and BAK1). Genes involved in interferon production and signalling were also detected (IRF1, IRF9, and IRF7), in addition to IL6, IL10, and IL17. Higher mRNA levels of IL6, IL17 and IL10 were observed in the SG of pSS patients compared to controls. Moreover, IL17 positive cells were detected mostly interstitially in the SG and around adipocytes, also within the focal infiltrates. In conclusion, adipocyte development seems to be more prominent in the SG of pSS patients, where adipose tissue replacement is also evident. Whether this is due to disease progression, or the repair process, remains to be investigated. Detection of IL17 positive adipocytes in the target organ suggests their involvement in immune reactions.	2019	10	03	Autoimmunity	Aqrawi	Lara A
29654272	10.1038/s41375-018-0110-4	Identification of novel lncRNAs regulated by the TAL1 complex in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB) positively regulate each other and coordinately regulate the expression of their downstream target genes in T-ALL cells. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells. This included a known lncRNA (lnc-OAZ3-2:7) located near the RORC gene, which was expressed in normal thymocytes but repressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cells.	2019	06	13	Leukemia	Ngoc	Phuong Cao Thi
28256501	10.1038/ncomms14616	Genetic and regulatory mechanism of susceptibility to high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at 10p21.2.	Despite high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL) being the most common subgroup of paediatric ALL, its aetiology remains unknown. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated association at 10q21.2. Here, we sought to determine how this region influences HD-ALL risk. We impute genotypes across the locus, finding the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7090445 highly associated with HD-ALL (P=1.54 × 10<sup>-38</sup>), and residing in a predicted enhancer element. We show this region physically interacts with the transcription start site of ARID5B, that alleles of rs7090445 have differential enhancer activity and influence RUNX3 binding. RUNX3 knock-down reduces ARID5B expression and rs7090445 enhancer activity. Individuals carrying the rs7090445-C risk allele also have reduced ARID5B expression. Finally, the rs7090445-C risk allele is preferentially retained in HD-ALL blasts consistent with inherited genetic variation contributing to arrest of normal lymphocyte development, facilitating leukaemic clonal expansion. These data provide evidence for a biological mechanism underlying hereditary risk of HD-ALL at 10q21.2.	2018	12	11	Nat Commun	Studd	James B
28381164	10.1177/1010428317697573	Association of ARID5B gene variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children.	Studies have shown an association between ARID5B gene polymorphisms and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the association between ARID5B variants and acute lymphoblastic leukemia among the Arab population still needs to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ARID5B variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children. A total of 14 ARID5B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 289 Yemeni children, of whom 136 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 153 were controls, using the nanofluidic Dynamic Array (Fluidigm 192.24 Dynamic Array). Using logistic regression adjusted for age and gender, the risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We found that nine SNPs were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under additive genetic models: rs7073837, rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10821936, rs4506592, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. Furthermore, the recessive models revealed that six SNPs were risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. The gender-specific impact of these SNPs under the recessive genetic model revealed that SNPs rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs6479779 in females, and rs10821938 and rs7923074 in males were significantly associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk. Under the dominant model, SNPs rs7073837, rs10821936, rs7896246, and rs6479778 in males only showed striking association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The additive model revealed that SNPs with significant association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were rs10821936 (both males and females); rs7073837, rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs4948487 (females only); and rs7089424, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074 (males only). In addition, the ARID5B haplotype block (CGAACACAA) showed a higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The haplotype (CCCGACTGC) was associated with protection against acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In conclusion, our study has shown that ARID5B variants are associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children with several gender biases of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms reported.	2017	04	18	Tumour Biol	Al-Absi	Boshra
28751478	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-0360	Novel Gene and Network Associations Found for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Using Case-Control and Family-Based Studies in Multiethnic Populations.	<b>Background:</b> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, suggesting that germline variants influence ALL risk. Although multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified variants predisposing children to ALL, it remains unclear whether genetic heterogeneity affects ALL susceptibility and how interactions within and among genes containing ALL-associated variants influence ALL risk.<b>Methods:</b> Here, we jointly analyzed two published datasets of case-control GWA summary statistics along with germline data from ALL case-parent trios. We used the gene-level association method PEGASUS to identify genes with multiple variants associated with ALL. We then used PEGASUS gene scores as input to the network analysis algorithm HotNet2 to characterize the genomic architecture of ALL.<b>Results:</b> Using PEGASUS, we confirmed associations previously observed at genes such as <i>ARID5B, IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B</i>, and <i>PIP4K2A</i>, and we identified novel candidate gene associations. Using HotNet2, we uncovered significant gene subnetworks that may underlie inherited ALL risk: a subnetwork involved in B-cell differentiation containing the ALL-associated gene <i>CEBPE</i>, and a subnetwork of homeobox genes, including <i>MEIS1</i><b>Conclusions:</b> Gene and network analysis uncovered loci associated with ALL that are missed by GWA studies, such as <i>MEIS1</i> Furthermore, ALL-associated loci do not appear to interact directly with each other to influence ALL risk, and instead appear to influence leukemogenesis through multiple, complex pathways.<b>Impact:</b> We present a new pipeline for <i>post hoc</i> analysis of association studies that yields new insight into the etiology of ALL and can be applied in future studies to shed light on the genomic underpinnings of cancer. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(10); 1531-9. ©2017 AACR</i>.	2018	05	29	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Nakka	Priyanka
28817678	10.1371/journal.pone.0180488	Family-based exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia among Hispanics confirms role of ARID5B in susceptibility.	We conducted an exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among Hispanics to confirm and identify novel variants associated with disease risk in this population. We used a case-parent trio study design; unlike more commonly used case-control studies, this study design is ideal for avoiding issues with population stratification bias among this at-risk ethnic group. Using 710 individuals from 323 Guatemalan and US Hispanic families, two inherited SNPs in ARID5B reached genome-wide level significance: rs10821936, RR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.70-3.14, p = 1.7×10-8 and rs7089424, RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.64-3.01, p = 5.2×10-8. Similar results were observed when restricting our analyses to those with the B-ALL subtype: ARID5B rs10821936 RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.02, p = 9.63×10-8 and ARID5B rs7089424 RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.57-2.88, p = 2.81×10-7. Notably, effect sizes observed for rs7089424 and rs10821936 in our study were &gt;20% higher than those reported among non-Hispanic white populations in previous genetic association studies. Our results confirmed the role of ARID5B in childhood ALL susceptibility among Hispanics; however, our assessment did not reveal any strong novel inherited genetic risks for acute lymphoblastic leukemia among this ethnic group.	2017	10	18	PLoS One	Archer	Natalie P
28905228	10.1007/s12032-017-1038-7	Genetic susceptibility in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and a leading cause of death due to disease in children. The genetic basis of ALL susceptibility has been supported by its association with certain congenital disorders and, more recently, by several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These GWAS identified common variants in ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, LHPP and ELK3 influencing ALL risk. However, the risk variants of these SNPs were not validated in all populations, suggesting that some of the loci could be population specific. On the other hand, the currently identified risk SNPs in these genes only account for 19% of the additive heritable risk. This estimation indicates that additional susceptibility variants could be discovered. In this review, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in genetic susceptibility of childhood ALL in all GWAS and subsequent studies and we will also point to future directions that could be explored in the near future.	2018	05	09	Med Oncol	Gutierrez-Camino	Angela
29326336	10.1101/gad.302646.117	ARID5B as a critical downstream target of the TAL1 complex that activates the oncogenic transcriptional program and promotes T-cell leukemogenesis.	The oncogenic transcription factor <i>TAL1/SCL</i> induces an aberrant transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. However, the critical factors that are directly activated by TAL1 and contribute to T-ALL pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identified <i>AT-rich interactive domain 5B</i> (<i>ARID5B</i>) as a collaborating oncogenic factor involved in the transcriptional program in T-ALL. <i>ARID5B</i> expression is down-regulated at the double-negative 2-4 stages in normal thymocytes, while it is induced by the TAL1 complex in human T-ALL cells. The enhancer located 135 kb upstream of the <i>ARID5B</i> gene locus is activated under a superenhancer in T-ALL cells but not in normal T cells. Notably, ARID5B-bound regions are associated predominantly with active transcription. ARID5B and TAL1 frequently co-occupy target genes and coordinately control their expression. ARID5B positively regulates the expression of TAL1 and its regulatory partners. ARID5B also activates the expression of the oncogene <i>MYC</i> Importantly, ARID5B is required for the survival and growth of T-ALL cells<i>,</i> and forced expression of ARID5B in immature thymocytes results in thymus retention, differentiation arrest, radioresistance, and tumor formation in zebrafish. Our results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and <i>MYC</i> in T-ALL, thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.	2018	02	08	Genes Dev	Leong	Wei Zhong
26941364	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0528	Pathway Analysis of Genome-wide Association Study in Childhood Leukemia among Hispanics.	The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is nearly 20% higher among Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites. Previous studies have shown evidence for association between risk of ALL and variation within IKZF1, ARID5B, CEBPE, CDKN2A, GATA3, and BM1-PIP4K2A genes. However, variants identified only account for &lt;10% of the genetic risk of ALL. We applied pathway-based analyses to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biologic pathways were overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among SNPs. Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may involve distinct biologic mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and focal adhesion (PFDR &lt; 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell malignancies. Several candidate genes for ALL, such as COL6A6 and COL5A1, were identified through targeted maximum likelihood estimation. This is the first study to show distinct biologic pathways are overrepresented in different ALL subtypes using pathway-based approaches, and identified potential gene candidates using causal inference methods. The findings demonstrate that newly developed bioinformatics tools and causal inference methods can provide insights to furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia.

27184773	10.3109/08880018.2016.1161685	Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, CDKN2A, and CEBPE with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Tunisian children and their contribution to racial differences in leukemia incidence.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focusing on pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2), CDKN2A (9p21.3), and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly associated to the risk of developing pediatric ALL. These studies have been conducted in European and Thai populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of pediatric ALL. In order to explore the impact of these variants on pediatric ALL risk in the Tunisian population, we genotyped 58 cases of pediatric ALL and 150 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs7089424 (10q21.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Our results, which are consistent with findings in European populations, show that 3 SNPs, i.e., rs4132601 (P = .00116, odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.42, 5.87]), rs7089424 (P = .0022, OR = 0.49, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.79]), and rs2239633 (P = .0010, OR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.75]) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing pediatric ALL (P &lt; .05). Furthermore, we show differences in allele frequencies in SNPs between Tunisian and Caucasian and/or Thai populations (e.g., CEBPE, rs2239633; population attributable risk [PAR] ∼15-fold the PAR of Thai population). These differences, combined with differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between populations and differences in size between populations, may contribute to racial differences in pediatric ALL incidence. 	2017	04	07	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Gharbi	Hanene
27644650		Association of Genetic Variants in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with Risk of Childhood de novo B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in India.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous genetic disease and its etiology remains poorly understood. Recent genome wide association and replication studies have highlighted specic polymorphisms contributing to childhood ALL predispositions mostly in European populations. It is unclear if these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of ALL. The current case-control study evaluated variants in ARID5B (rs7089424, rs10821936), IKZF1 (rs4132601) and CEBPE (rs2239633) genes, which appear most significantly associated with risk of developing childhood B-lineage ALL. Using TaqMan assays, genotyping was conducted for 162 de novo B-lineage ALL cases and 150 unrelated healthy controls in India. Appropriate statistical methods were applied. Genotypic and allelic frequencies differed significantly between cases and controls at IKZF1-rs4132601 (p=0.039, p=0.015) and ARID5B-rs10821936 (p=0.028, p=0.026). Both rs10821936 (p=0.019; OR 0.67; 95% CI=0.47-0.94) and rs4132601 (p=0.018; OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.48-0.94) were associated with reduced disease risk. Moreover, gender- analysis revealed male-specific risk associations for rs10821936 (p=0.041 CT+CC) and rs4132601 (p=0.005 G allele). Further, ARID5B-rs7089424 and CEBPE-rs2239633 showed a trend towards decreased disease risk but without significance (p=0.073; p=0.73). Our findings provide the rst evidence that SNPs ARID5B- rs10821936 and IKZF1-rs4132601 are associated with decreased B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Indian children. Understanding the effects of these variants in different ethnic groups is crucial as they may confer different risk of ALL within different populations.	2017	02	02	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Bhandari	Prerana
28476190	10.1016/j.arcmed.2016.12.003	ARID5B, CEBPE and PIP4K2A Germline Genetic Polymorphisms and Risk of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Mexican Patients: A MIGICCL Study.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of childhood cancer-related deaths worldwide. Multiples studies have shown that ALL seems to be originated by an interaction between environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. The ARID5B polymorphisms are among the most reproducible ALL associated-risk alleles in different populations. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of ARID5B, CEBPE, and PIP4K2 risk alleles for the development of ALL in children from Mexico City and Yucatan, Mexico. A study was conducted with a total of 761 unrelated subjects. Two hundred eighty five ALL cases (111 from Yucatan and 174 from Mexico City) and 476 healthy subjects. Genotyping included the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A), rs10821936 (ARID5B), rs7089424 (ARID5B) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms. Associations between ALL and rs10821936 and rs7089424 ARID5B SNPs were found (OR = 1.9, 95% CI (1.5-2.4) and OR = 2.0, 95% CI (1.6-2.5), respectively). Moreover, a higher risk was observed in the homozygous risk genotypes of carriers from Mexico City (OR = 3.1, 95% CI (2.0-4.9) and OR 3.1, CI 95% (2.0-4.8), respectively). Otherwise, the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms were not associated with ALL risk. Our analysis suggests that ARID5B confers risk for childhood ALL in a Mexican population.	2017	07	06	Arch Med Res	Bekker-Méndez	Vilma Carolina
24707947	10.3109/10428194.2014.910662	Genetic markers in a multi-ethnic sample for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk.	Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple risk loci for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but mostly in European/White populations, despite Hispanics having a greater risk. We re-examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of known associations with childhood ALL and known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region lymphoma risk markers in a multi-ethnic population. Significant associations were found in two ARID5B variants (rs7089424 and rs10821936). We replicated a strong risk association in non-Hispanic White males with rs2395185, a protective marker for lymphoma. Another HLA region marker, rs2647012, showed a risk association among Hispanics only, while a strong protective association was found with rs1048456, a follicular lymphoma risk marker. Our study validated this new case-control sample by confirming genetic markers associated with childhood ALL, and yielded new associations with lymphoma markers. Despite positive results, our study did not provide any clues as to why Hispanics have a higher susceptibility to childhood leukemia, suggesting that environmental factors may have a strong contribution.	2015	10	07	Leuk Lymphoma	Kennedy	Amy E

25150625	10.1016/j.bcmd.2014.07.011	Concordant B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in non-twinned siblings.	Associating the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with genetic predisposition is still a challenge. Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1 usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53, and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found in the parents. Altogether, our data suggest that genetic predisposition aligned with chance haa an additive effect in BCP-ALL outcome.	2015	07	29	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Pombo-de-Oliveira	Maria S
25761407	10.1007/s10552-015-0550-3	Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and surrogates for early-life infections with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanic children.	Genome-wide association studies focusing on European-ancestry populations have identified ALL risk loci on IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. To capture the impacts of these genes on ALL risk in the California Hispanic population, we comprehensively assessed the variation within the genes and further assessed the joint effects between the genetic variation and surrogates for early-life infections (the presence of older siblings, daycare attendance, and ear infections). Genotypic data for 323 Hispanic ALL cases and 454 controls from the California Childhood Leukemia Study were generated using Illumina OmniExpress v1 platform. Logistic regression assuming a log-additive model estimated odds ratios (OR) associated with each SNP, adjusted for age, sex, and the first five principal components. In addition, we examined potential interactions between six ALL risk alleles and surrogates for early-life infections using logistic regression models that included an interaction term. Significant associations between genotypes at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and ALL risk were identified: rs7780012, OR 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.71 (p = 0.004); rs7089424, OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.65 (p = 1.16 × 10(-9)); rs4982731, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.37-2.08 (p = 2.35 × 10(-6)), respectively. Evidence for multiplicative interactions between genetic variants and surrogates for early-life infections with ALL risk was not observed. Consistent with findings in non-Hispanic White population, our study showed that variants within IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE were associated with increased ALL risk, and the effects for ARID5B and CEBPE were most prominent in the high-hyperdiploid ALL subtype in the California Hispanic population. Results implicate the ARID5B, CEBPE, and IKZF1 genes in the pathogenesis of childhood ALL.	2016	03	21	Cancer Causes Control	Hsu	Ling-I
25806972	10.1371/journal.pone.0121348	ARID5B, IKZF1 and non-genetic factors in the etiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: the ESCALE study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified that frequent polymorphisms in ARID5B and IKZF1, two genes involved in lymphoid differentiation, increase the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These findings markedly modified the current field of research on the etiology of ALL. In this new context, the present exploratory study investigated the possible interactions between these at-risk alleles and the non-genetic suspected ALL risk factors that were of sufficient prevalence in the French ESCALE study: maternal use of home insecticides during pregnancy, preconception paternal smoking, and some proxies for early immune modulation, i.e. breastfeeding, history of common infections before age one year, and birth order. The analyses were based on 434 ALL cases and 442 controls of European origin, drawn from the nationwide population-based case-control study ESCALE. Information on non-genetic factors was obtained by standardized telephone interview. Interactions between rs10740055 in ARID5B or rs4132601 in IKZF1 and each of the suspected non-genetic factors were tested, with the SNPs coded as counts of minor alleles (trend variable). Statistical interactions were observed between rs4132601 and maternal insecticide use (p = 0.012), breastfeeding p = 0.017) and repeated early common infections (p = 0.0070), with allelic odds ratios (OR) which were only increased among the children not exposed to insecticides (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.4), those who had been breastfed (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.5) and those who had had repeated early common infections (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.5, 3.8). The allelic ORs were close to one among children exposed to insecticides, who had not been breastfed and who had had no or few common infections. Repeated early common infections interacted with rs10740055 (p = 0.018) in the case-only design. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these observations of a modification of the effect of the at-risk alleles by non-genetic factors are chance findings or reflect true underlying mechanisms. 	2016	02	17	PLoS One	Rudant	Jérémie
26104880	10.1038/ncomms8553	Inherited coding variants at the CDKN2A locus influence susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children.	There is increasing evidence from genome-wide association studies for a strong inherited genetic basis of susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, yet the effects of protein-coding variants on ALL risk have not been systematically evaluated. Here we show a missense variant in CDKN2A associated with the development of ALL at genome-wide significance (rs3731249, P=9.4 × 10(-23), odds ratio=2.23). Functional studies indicate that this hypomorphic variant results in reduced tumour suppressor function of p16(INK4A), increases the susceptibility to leukaemic transformation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, and is preferentially retained in ALL tumour cells. Resequencing the CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus in 2,407 childhood ALL cases reveals 19 additional putative functional germline variants. These results provide direct functional evidence for the influence of inherited genetic variation on ALL risk, highlighting the important and complex roles of CDKN2A-CDKN2B tumour suppressors in leukaemogenesis. 	2016	04	05	Nat Commun	Xu	Heng
26575185	10.1371/journal.pone.0143343	Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test Using ddPCR (SMART-ddPCR): An Accurate Method for Assessment of Preferential Allelic Imbalance in Tumor DNA.	The extent to which heritable genetic variants can affect tumor development has yet to be fully elucidated. Tumor selection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles, a phenomenon called preferential allelic imbalance (PAI), has been demonstrated in some cancer types. We developed a novel application of digital PCR termed Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test using Droplet Digital PCR (SMART-ddPCR) for accurate assessment of tumor PAI, and have applied this method to test the hypothesis that heritable SNPs associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may demonstrate tumor PAI. These SNPs are located at CDKN2A (rs3731217) and IKZF1 (rs4132601), genes frequently lost in ALL, and at CEBPE (rs2239633), ARID5B (rs7089424), PIP4K2A (rs10764338), and GATA3 (rs3824662), genes located on chromosomes gained in high-hyperdiploid ALL. We established thresholds of AI using constitutional DNA from SNP heterozygotes, and subsequently measured allelic copy number in tumor DNA from 19-142 heterozygote samples per SNP locus. We did not find significant tumor PAI at these loci, though CDKN2A and IKZF1 SNPs showed a trend towards preferential selection of the risk allele (p = 0.17 and p = 0.23, respectively). Using a genomic copy number control ddPCR assay, we investigated somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) underlying AI at CDKN2A and IKZF1, revealing a complex range of alterations including homozygous and hemizygous deletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, with varying degrees of clonality. Copy number estimates from ddPCR showed high agreement with those from multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assays. We demonstrate that SMART-ddPCR is a highly accurate method for investigation of tumor PAI and for assessment of the somatic alterations underlying AI. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified 16 recurrent SCNA loci that contain heritable cancer risk SNPs associated with a matching tumor type, and which represent candidate PAI regions warranting further investigation. 	2016	06	28	PLoS One	de Smith	Adam J
23975371	10.1007/s13277-013-1097-0	ARID5B gene rs10821936 polymorphism is associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis based on 39,116 subjects.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children. Two recent genome-wide association studies and several replicated studies have provided convincing evidence that inherited genetic variation in ARID5B contributes to childhood ALL predisposition. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the association between ARID5B genetic polymorphism and the risk for ALL. We conducted a search of case-control studies on the association of ARID5B genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to ALL in PubMed, EMBASE, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data from eligible studies were extracted for meta-analysis. ALL risk associated with ARID5B genetic polymorphism was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Nine articles including 13 case-control studies were included in the present meta-analysis. We found that rs10821936 polymorphism in ARID5B gene was associated with increased risk for ALL (P &lt; 0.0001; OR = 1.27; 95%CI, 1.17-1.37). This meta-analysis suggests that ARID5B genetic polymorphism was associated with the increased risk of ALL.	2014	03	26	Tumour Biol	Guo	Lei-Ming
24200646	10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.10.003	High-resolution melting analyses for genetic variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility loci in Taiwan.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a heterogeneous disease that includes multiple subtypes is defined by cell lineage and chromosome anomalies. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several ARID5B and IKZF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of ALL. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and convenient technique to detect SNPs; we thereby detected SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We enrolled 79 pediatric ALL patients and 80 healthy controls. Polymorphic variants of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs7073837, rs10740055, and rs7089424) were detected by HRM, and SNPs were analyzed for association with childhood ALL. The distribution of genotype rs7073837 in ARID5B significantly differed between ALL and controls (P=0.046), while those of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs10740055 and rs7089424) did not. We analyzed the association for SNPs with B lineage ALL to find rs7073837 in ARID5B, conferring a higher risk for B lineage ALL (odds ratio, OR=1.70, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.01-2.87, P=0.049). HRM is a practical method to detect SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We found that rs7073837 in ARID5B correlated with a risk for childhood B lineage ALL.	2014	08	13	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Lin	Chien-Yu

24712521	10.1111/bjh.12886	Associations of novel genetic variations in the folate-related and ARID5B genes with the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of high-dose methotrexate in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.	High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) plays an important role in the consolidation therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in many treatment regimens worldwide. However, there is a large interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the drug. We investigated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the folate metabolic pathway, transporter molecules and transcription proteins on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of MTX and 7-hydroxy-methotrexate (7-OH-MTX). 63 SNPs of 14 genes were genotyped and a total of 463 HD-MTX courses (administered according to the ALL-BFM 95 and ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocols) were analysed. Haematological, hepatic and renal toxicities, estimated by routine laboratory parameters were evaluated. Random forest and regression trees were used for variable selection and model building. Linear mixed models were established to prove the significance of the selected variables. SNPs (rs4948502, rs4948496, rs4948487) of the ARID5B gene were associated with the serum levels of MTX (P &lt; 0·02), serum levels and area under the curve of 7-OH-MTX (P &lt; 0·02) and with hypoproteinaemia (P = 0·004). SLCO1B1 rs4149056 also showed a significant association with serum MTX levels (P &lt; 0·001). Our findings confirm the association of novel genetic variations in folate-related and ARID5B genes with the serum MTX levels and acute toxicity.	2014	10	09	Br J Haematol	Csordas	Katalin
24753091	10.1002/ajh.23727	Genomic ancestry and somatic alterations correlate with age at diagnosis in Hispanic children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Hispanic children have a higher incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than non-Hispanic whites but tend to be diagnosed at older ages. In genome-wide association studies, Native American ancestry and polymorphisms in six genes have been associated with ALL risk. In multivariable regression models, we investigated whether genomic ancestry, inherited risk SNPs, or acquired somatic alterations were associated with differences in age at diagnosis in Hispanic children with B-cell ALL. Genome-wide array data were used to estimate each participant's percent membership in the three Hispanic ancestral populations: Native American, African, and European. Each 20% increase in European ancestry was associated with a six month younger age at diagnosis (95% CI = 0.36-11.6 months, P = 0.037). Correspondingly, each 20% increase in Native American ancestry was associated with a six-month older age at diagnosis (P = 0.037). Both the TEL-AML1 translocation and high-hyperdiploidy were associated with younger age at diagnosis (24.4 months, P = 2.0 x 10(-4) and 12.4 months, P = 0.011, respectively), while CDKN2A and IKZF1 deletions were associated with older age at diagnosis (19.7 months, P = 7.0 x 10(-4) and 18.1 months, P = 0.012, respectively). No associations with age at diagnosis were observed for RAS mutation, PAX5 deletion or for known heritable risk alleles in IKZF1, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, GATA3, ARID5B, or CEBPE. Because younger age at diagnosis is associated with improved treatment outcomes for children with ALL, the effect of European ancestry on ALL survival may be mediated by its effect on age at diagnosis, or by proxy, its association with more treatable molecular subtypes of ALL.	2014	10	09	Am J Hematol	Walsh	Kyle M
25096228	10.1159/000363660	A new system identification approach to identify genetic variants in sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.	We propose in this paper a set-valued (SV) system model, which is a generalized form of logistic (LG) and Probit (Probit) regression, to be considered as a method for discovering genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants in next-generation sequencing studies, for a binary phenotype. We propose a new SV system identification method to estimate all underlying key system parameters for the Probit model and compare it with the LG model in the setting of genetic association studies. Across an extensive series of simulation studies, the Probit method maintained type I error control and had similar or greater power than the LG method, which is robust to different distributions of noise: logistic, normal, or t distributions. Additionally, the Probit association parameter estimate was 2.7-46.8-fold less variable than the LG log-odds ratio association parameter estimate. Less variability in the association parameter estimate translates to greater power and robustness across the spectrum of minor allele frequencies (MAFs), and these advantages are the most pronounced for rare variants. For instance, in a simulation that generated data from an additive logistic model with an odds ratio of 7.4 for a rare single nucleotide polymorphism with a MAF of 0.005 and a sample size of 2,300, the Probit method had 60% power whereas the LG method had 25% power at the α = 10(-6) level. Consistent with these simulation results, the set of variants identified by the LG method was a subset of those identified by the Probit method in two example analyses. Thus, we suggest the Probit method may be a competitive alternative to the LG method in genetic association studies such as candidate gene, genome-wide, or next-generation sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.	2015	04	23	Hum Hered	Kang	Guolian
25124600	10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.15.6211	Associations between AT-rich interactive domain 5B gene polymorphisms and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, replicated studies reported some inconsistent results in different populations. Using meta-analysis, we here aimed to clarify the nature of the genetic risks contributed by the two polymorphisms (rs10994982, rs7089424) for developing childhood ALL. Through searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and manually searching relevant references, a total of 14 articles with 16 independent studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to assess the associations. Both SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 showed significant associations with childhood ALL risk in all genetic models after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, subtype analyses of B-lineage ALL provided strong evidence that SNP rs10994982 is highly associated with the risk of developing B-hyperdiploid ALL. These results indicate that SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 are indeed significantly associated with increased risk of childhood ALL. 	2017	01	24	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Zeng	Hui

25310577	10.1371/journal.pone.0110255	Confirmation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia variants, ARID5B and IKZF1, and interaction with parental environmental exposures.	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have established association of ARID5B and IKZF1 variants with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors alone appear to make a relatively minor contribution to disease risk. The polygenic nature of childhood ALL predisposition together with the timing of environmental triggers may hold vital clues for disease etiology. This study presents results from an Australian GWAS of childhood ALL cases (n = 358) and population controls (n = 1192). Furthermore, we utilised family trio (n = 204) genotypes to extend our investigation to gene-environment interaction of significant loci with parental exposures before conception, and child's sex and age. Thirteen SNPs achieved genome wide significance in the population based case/control analysis; ten annotated to ARID5B and three to IKZF1. The most significant SNPs in these regions were ARID5B rs4245595 (OR 1.63, CI 1.38-1.93, P = 2.13×10(-9)), and IKZF1 rs1110701 (OR 1.69, CI 1.42-2.02, p = 7.26×10(-9)). There was evidence of gene-environment interaction for risk genotype at IKZF1, whereby an apparently stronger genetic effect was observed if the mother took folic acid or if the father did not smoke prior to pregnancy (respective interaction P-values: 0.04, 0.05). There were no interactions of risk genotypes with age or sex (P-values &gt;0.2). Our results evidence that interaction of genetic variants and environmental exposures may further alter risk of childhood ALL however, investigation in a larger population is required. If interaction of folic acid supplementation and IKZF1 variants holds, it may be useful to quantify folate levels prior to initiating use of folic acid supplements.	2015	09	17	PLoS One	Evans	Tiffany-Jane
22422485	10.1002/pbc.24131	Genetic variants modify susceptibility to leukemia in infants: a Children's Oncology Group report.	The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is commonly rearranged in infant leukemia (IL). Genetic determinants of susceptibility to IL are unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have identified susceptibility loci at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. We genotyped these loci in 171 infants with leukemia and 384 controls and evaluated associations overall, by subtype [ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)], and by presence (+) or absence (-) of MLL rearrangements. Homozygosity for a variant IKZF1 allele (rs11978267) increased risk of infant AML [Odds ratio (OR) = 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-8.4]; the increased risk was similar for AML/MLL+ and MLL- cases. In contrast, risk of ALL/MLL- was increased in infants homozygous for the IKZF1 variant (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.8-14.5) but the variant did not modify risk of ALL/MLL+. For ARID5B (rs10821936), homozygosity for the variant allele increased risk for the ALL/MLL- subgroup only (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 2.5-20.6). There was little evidence of an association with the CEBP variant (rs2239633). IKZF1 is expressed in early hematopoiesis, including precursor myeloid cells. Our data provide the first evidence that IKZF1 modifies susceptibility to infant AML, irrespective of MLL rearrangements, and could provide important new etiologic insights into this rare and heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy.	2013	03	07	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Ross	Julie A
23382691	10.1371/journal.pgen.1003225	Loci associated with N-glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G show pleiotropy with autoimmune diseases and haematological cancers.	Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247 individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of 1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P&lt;2.27 × 10(-9)) in the discovery analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation of a single plasma protein using GWAS. The results may also provide an explanation for the reported pleiotropy and antagonistic effects of loci involved in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.	2013	05	30	PLoS Genet	Lauc	Gordan
23512250	10.1093/jnci/djt042	Novel susceptibility variants at 10p12.31-12.2 for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in ethnically diverse populations.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and the incidence of ALL varies by ethnicity. Although accumulating evidence indicates inherited predisposition to ALL, the genetic basis of ALL susceptibility in diverse ancestry has not been comprehensively examined. We performed a multiethnic genome-wide association study in 1605 children with ALL and 6661 control subjects after adjusting for population structure, with validation in three replication series of 845 case subjects and 4316 control subjects. Association was tested by two-sided logistic regression. A novel ALL susceptibility locus at 10p12.31-12.2 (BMI1-PIP4K2A, rs7088318, P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) was identified in the genome-wide association study, with independent replication in European Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans (P = .001, .009, and .04, respectively). Association was also validated at four known ALL susceptibility loci: ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and CDKN2A/2B. Associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants were consistent across ethnicity, with multiple independent signals at IKZF1 and BMI1-PIP4K2A loci. The frequency of ARID5B and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants differed by ethnicity, in parallel with ethnic differences in ALL incidence. Suggestive evidence for modifying effects of age on genetic predisposition to ALL was also observed. ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants cumulatively conferred strong predisposition to ALL, with children carrying six to eight copies of risk alleles at a ninefold (95% confidence interval = 6.9 to 11.8) higher ALL risk relative to those carrying zero to one risk allele at these four single nucleotide polymorphisms. These findings indicate strong associations between inherited genetic variation and ALL susceptibility in children and shed new light on ALL molecular etiology in diverse ancestry.	2013	07	08	J Natl Cancer Inst	Xu	Heng
23608171	10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.028	Association of three polymorphisms in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a Chinese population.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focus on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2) and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly related to the risk of childhood ALL. These polymorphisms may lead to abnormal expression and dysfunction of the corresponding transcription factors and are likely to increase the risk of ALL. To validate the relationship between these SNPs and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL cases and 673 controls. We determined that the SNP rs10821936 in ARID5B was statistically significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL (P&lt;0.0001). The results were also significant for the subgroup analysis of high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk ALL as well as B-lineage ALL. Statistically significant differences were not found in the SNPs for IKZF1 and CEBPE. In conclusion, ARID5B rs10821936 could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese children.	2013	08	05	Gene	Wang	Yaping
23692655	10.1016/j.leukres.2013.04.022	ARID5B and IKZF1 variants, selected demographic factors, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.	Interactions between common germline variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 and other known childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk factors were queried using biospecimens and data from 770 ALL cases and 384 controls. Case-control comparisons revealed dose-dependent associations between ARID5B rs10821936, ARID5B rs10994982, and IKZF1 rs11978267 and childhood ALL overall, and B lineage and B lineage hyperdiploid ALL examined separately (all allelic odds ratios ≥1.33, Ptrend≤0.001). No heterogeneity was observed between ORs for males and females (all Pinteraction≥0.48). Likewise, no significant genotype-birth weight interactions were detected (all Pinteraction≥0.12) among cases. These results indicate similar ALL risk across strata of known risk factors. 	2013	09	17	Leuk Res	Linabery	Amy M
23836053	10.1007/s10552-013-0256-3	Genetic variants in ARID5B and CEBPE are childhood ALL susceptibility loci in Hispanics.	Recent genome-wide studies conducted in European Whites have identified novel susceptibility genes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to examine whether these loci are susceptibility genes among Hispanics, whose reported incidence of childhood ALL is the highest of all ethnic groups in California, and whether their effects differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). We genotyped 13 variants in these genes among 706 Hispanic (300 cases, 406 controls) and 594 NHW (225 cases, 369 controls) participants in a matched population-based case-control study in California. We found significant associations for the five studied ARID5B variants in both Hispanics (p values of 1.0 × 10(-9) to 0.004) and NHWs (p values of 2.2 × 10(-6) to 0.018). Risk estimates were in the same direction in both groups (ORs of 1.53-1.99 and 1.37-1.84, respectively) and strengthened when restricted to B-cell precursor high-hyperdiploid ALL (&gt;50 chromosomes; ORs of 2.21-3.22 and 1.67-2.71, respectively). Similar results were observed for the single CEBPE variant. Hispanics and NHWs exhibited different susceptibility loci at CDKN2A. Although IKZF1 loci showed significant susceptibility effects among NHWs (p &lt; 1 × 10(-5)), their effects among Hispanics were in the same direction but nonsignificant, despite similar minor allele frequencies. Future studies should examine whether the observed effects vary by environmental, immunological, or lifestyle factors.	2014	06	11	Cancer Causes Control	Chokkalingam	Anand P
23996088	10.1182/blood-2013-03-491316	Variation at 10p12.2 and 10p14 influences risk of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and phenotype.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer diagnosed in economically developed countries with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, accounting for approximately 70% of ALL. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided the first unambiguous evidence for common inherited susceptibility to BCP-ALL, identifying susceptibility loci at 7p12.2, 9p21.3, 10q21.2, and 14q11.2. To identify additional BCP-ALL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1658 cases and 4723 controls, with validation in 1449 cases and 1488 controls. Combined analysis identified novel loci mapping to 10p12.2 (rs10828317, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; P = 2.30 × 10(-9)) and 10p14 marked by rs3824662 (OR = 1.31; P = 8.62 × 10(-12)). The single nucleotide polymorphism rs10828317 is responsible for the N215S polymorphism in exon 7 of PIP4K2A, and rs3824662 localizes to intron 3 of the transcription factor and putative tumor suppressor gene GATA3. The rs10828317 association was shown to be specifically associated with hyperdiploid ALL, whereas the rs3824662-associated risk was confined to nonhyperdiploid non-TEL-AML1 + ALL. The risk allele of rs3824662 was correlated with older age at diagnosis (P &lt; .001) and significantly worse event-free survivorship (P &lt; .0001). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to BCP-ALL and the influence of constitutional genotype on disease development. 	2014	01	07	Blood	Migliorini	Gabriele
24013273	10.1007/s00432-013-1512-3	Intron 3 of the ARID5B gene: a hot spot for acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility.	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) have been associated with risk for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After reviewing previous studies, we realized that the most significant associations were restricted to intron 3, but the mechanism(s) by which those SNPs affect ALL risk remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the association between genetic variants of the intron 3 region of ARID5B and the incidence of B-ALL in a Spanish population. We also aimed to find a functional explanation for the association, searching for copy number variations (CNVs), and changes in ARID5B expression associated with the genotypes of the SNPs. We analyzed 10 SNPs in intron 3 of ARID5B in a Spanish population of 219 B-ALL patients and 397 unrelated controls with the Taqman Open Array platform. CNVs were analyzed in 23 patients and 17 controls using the Cytogenetics Whole-genome 2.7 M platform. Expression of ARID5B transcript 1 was quantified by qPCR and related to SNPs genotype in seven ALL cell lines. Association between intron 3 and B-ALL risk was confirmed for all of the SNPs evaluated in our Spanish population. We could not explain this association by the presence of CNVs. We neither detected changes in the expression of ARID5B isoform associated with the genotype of the SNPs. The intron 3 of ARID5B gene was found to be strongly associated with B-ALL risk in the Spanish population examined. However, neither CNVs nor changes in mRNA expression were found to be responsible for this association.	2013	12	16	J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	Gutiérrez-Camino	Ángela
22076464	10.1038/leu.2011.302	Identification of germline susceptibility loci in ETV6-RUNX1-rearranged childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease of the white blood cells. The etiology of ALL is believed to be multifactorial and likely to involve an interplay of environmental and genetic variables. We performed a genome-wide association study of 355 750 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 474 controls and 419 childhood ALL cases characterized by a t(12;21)(p13;q22) - the most common chromosomal translocation observed in childhood ALL - which leads to an ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The eight most strongly associated SNPs were followed-up in 951 ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases and 3061 controls from Germany/Austria and Italy, respectively. We identified a novel, genome-wide significant risk locus at 3q28 (TP63, rs17505102, P(CMH)=8.94 × 10(-9), OR=0.65). The separate analysis of the combined German/Austrian sample only, revealed additional genome-wide significant associations at 11q11 (OR8U8, rs1945213, P=9.14 × 10(-11), OR=0.69) and 8p21.3 (near INTS10, rs920590, P=6.12 × 10(-9), OR=1.36). These associations and another association at 11p11.2 (PTPRJ, rs3942852, P=4.95 × 10(-7), OR=0.72) remained significant in the German/Austrian replication panel after correction for multiple testing. Our findings demonstrate that germline genetic variation can specifically contribute to the risk of ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood ALL. The identification of TP63 and PTPRJ as susceptibility genes emphasize the role of the TP53 gene family and the importance of proteins regulating cellular processes in connection with tumorigenesis.	2012	07	05	Leukemia	Ellinghaus	E
22291082	10.1200/JCO.2011.38.0345	ARID5B genetic polymorphisms contribute to racial disparities in the incidence and treatment outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Recent genome-wide screens have identified genetic variations in ARID5B associated with susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to determine the contribution of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to racial disparities in ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome. We compared the association between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL susceptibility in whites (&gt; 95% European genetic ancestry; 978 cases and 1,046 controls) versus in Hispanics (&gt; 10% Native American ancestry; 330 cases and 541 controls). We determined the relationships between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL relapse risk in 1,605 children treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9904/9905 clinical trials. Among 49 ARID5B SNPs interrogated, 10 were significantly associated with ALL susceptibility in both whites and Hispanics (P &lt; .05), with risk alleles consistently more frequent in Hispanics than in whites. rs10821936 exhibited the most significant association in both races (P = 8.4 × 10(-20) in whites; P = 1 × 10(-6) in Hispanics), and genotype at this SNP was highly correlated with local Native American genetic ancestry (P = 1.8 × 10(-8)). Multivariate analyses in Hispanics identified an additional SNP associated with ALL susceptibility independent of rs10821936. Eight ARID5B SNPs were associated with both ALL susceptibility and relapse hazard; the alleles related to higher ALL incidence were always linked to poorer treatment outcome and were more frequent in Hispanics. ARID5B polymorphisms are important determinants of childhood ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome, and they contribute to racial disparities in this disease.	2012	06	08	J Clin Oncol	Xu	Heng
