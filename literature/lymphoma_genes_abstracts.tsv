35255429	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2021.151886	De Novo CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A genomic profiling study and prognostic analysis of 46 patients.	We reported 46 cases of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma which abnormally expressed CD5 protein (De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL), which had attracted researcher's attention for a period of time for its poor prognosis. However, there were few studies on its molecular change. In the present article, we summarized the genetic alterations using a lymphopanel detection method by Next Generation Sequencing(NGS). The most frequently mutated genes were MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> (20/46, 43.5%), followed by PIMI (19/46, 41.3%), IGLL5 (13/46, 28.3%)and CD79B (11/46, 23.9%). We further investigated the relationship between gene alterations and prognosis using OS(Overall survival) and PFS(Progression-free survival). MYD88, CREBBP, and ACTB mutation were significantly associated with inferior OS (P = 0.032, 0.000, 0.001), PIMI, CREBBP, ACTB and CXCR4 mutation were significantly associated with inferior PFS (P = 0.016, 0.001, 0.045, 0.024). Meanwhile, we found that De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL had BCL-6(9/46,19.6%), C-MYC (4/46, 8.7%) and IRF4 (2/19, 10.5%) rearrangement, but without BCL-2 rearrangement, there were no significantly associations with prognosis. In summary, our research explored the gene alterations of De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL in a relatively large scale for the first time, the most common gene mutation was MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> which was also a potential prognostic factor, providing a potential therapeutic target for the patients of De Novo CD5-positive DLBCL.	2022	05	23	Ann Diagn Pathol	Fan	Yue
35344115	10.1007/s11033-022-07337-w	Identification and validation of suitable housekeeping genes for gene expression studies in BCR-ABL1 positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The stability of the housekeeping gene (HKG) expression is an absolute prerequisite for accurate normalization of target gene expression in a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). In RQ-PCR, the widely used normalization approach involves the standardization of target genes to the most stable HKG control genes. According to the recent literature, in different experimental conditions the HKGs exhibit either up or down-regulation and thus affecting the gene expression profiles of target genes which leads to erroneous results. This implies that it is very important to select the appropriate HKG and verify the expression stability of the HKG before quantification of the target gene. The present study aims to analyze six different HKGs for their expression profiles and stability in BCR-ABL1 negative cases and validate them in BCR-ABL1 positive cases, detected by multiplex reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Six commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ABL1, RNA18S, ACTB, GUSB, and EEF2) were selected in this study. RQ-PCR was performed on 24 BCR-ABL1 negative cases and the outcomes were validated on 24 BCR-ABL1 positive cases. RefFinder™, a web-based composite software was used to check the stability of HKG genes by different algorithms and comprehensive ranking of each HKG gene in BCR-ABL1 negative cases and finally validated in BCR-ABL1 positive cases. It was found that RNA18S, ABL1 and GUSB are good stable HKG genes, which showed minimum variability in gene expression compared to GAPDH, EEF2, and ACTB, the most commonly used HKG.	2022	07	12	Mol Biol Rep	Gupta	Dikshat Gopal
35765478	10.14202/vetworld.2022.1333-1340	Investigation of proteomic profiles in canine lymphoma using tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics approach.	Specific tumor biomarkers are useful for the early diagnosis of cancer or can predict the recurrence of neoplastic disease in humans and animals. Lymphoma in dogs could be classified into B-, T-, and NK-cell origins. T-cell lymphoma has the worst prognosis with a shorter survival time and disease-free interval. This study aimed to identify the differential serum protein expressions of canine B- and T-cell lymphomas compared with healthy dogs using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Serum samples were collected from 20 untreated canine lymphomas (14 B-cells and 6 T-cells) and four healthy control dogs. Sera peptides from each sample were processed for TMT 10-plex tagging and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS). Differential proteome profiling was then compared between lymphoma and control. We discovered 20 elevated and 14 decreased serum proteins in the lymphoma group relative to the healthy group. Six candidate increased proteins in canine lymphomas were beta-actin cytoplasmic 1 (ACTB, p=0.04), haptoglobin (p=0.002), beta-2 microglobulin (aaaaaaaa2M, p=0.007), beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (APOH, p=0.03), metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1, p=0.03), and CD44 antigen (p=0.02). When compared between B- and T-cell lymphomas, B-cell phenotypes had upregulated immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain V region GOM (p=0.02), clusterin (p=0.01), apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1, p=0.05), and plasminogen (p=0.02). These findings were investigated quantitative serum proteomes between B- and T-cell lymphomas using TMT-based MS. ACTB, aaaaaaaa2M, APOH, TIMP-1, CD44 antigen, Ig heavy chain V region GOM, and APOC1 are novel candidate proteins and might serve as a lymphoma biomarker in dogs. However, evaluation with an increased sample size is needed to confirm their diagnostic and prognostic ability.	2022	07	16	Vet World	Fonghem	Piyanoot
33404293	10.1080/15548627.2020.1871204	BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy is required for mitochondrial remodeling during the differentiation of optic nerve oligodendrocytes.	Retinal ganglion cell axons are heavily myelinated (98%) and myelin damage in the optic nerve (ON) severely affects vision. Understanding the molecular mechanism of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes will be essential for developing new therapeutic approaches for ON demyelinating diseases. To this end, we developed a new method for isolation and culture of ON-derived oligodendrocyte lineage cells and used it to study OPC differentiation. A critical aspect of cellular differentiation is macroautophagy/autophagy, a catabolic process that allows for cell remodeling by degradation of excess or damaged cellular molecules and organelles. Knockdown of ATG9A and BECN1 (pro-autophagic proteins involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation) led to a significant reduction in proliferation and survival of OPCs. We also found that autophagy flux (a measure of autophagic degradation activity) is significantly increased during progression of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant change in mitochondrial dynamics during oligodendrocyte differentiation, which is associated with a significant increase in programmed mitophagy (selective autophagic clearance of mitochondria). This process is mediated by the mitophagy receptor BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like). BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial network formation, mitochondrial function and the viability of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes. Our studies provide novel evidence that proper mitochondrial dynamics is required for establishment of functional mitochondria in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings are significant because targeting BNIP3L-mediated programmed mitophagy may provide a novel therapeutic approach for stimulating myelin repair in ON demyelinating diseases.<b>Abbreviations:</b> A2B5: a surface antigen of oligodendrocytes precursor cells, A2B5 clone 105; ACTB: actin, beta; APC: an antibody to label mature oligodendrocytes, anti-adenomatous polyposis coli clone CC1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG9A: autophagy related 9A; AU: arbitrary units; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; BNIP3: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; CASP3: caspase 3; CNP: 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase; Ctl: control; COX8: cytochrome c oxidase subunit; CSPG4/NG2: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4; DAPI: 4'6-diamino-2-phenylindole; DNM1L: dynamin 1-like; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FIS1: fission, mitochondrial 1; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP: glial fibrillary growth factor; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HsESC: human embryonic stem cell; IEM: immunoelectron microscopy; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBP: myelin basic protein; MFN2: mitofusin 2; Mito-Keima: mitochondria-targeted monomeric keima-red; Mito-GFP: mitochondria-green fluorescent protein; Mito-RFP: mitochondria-red fluorescent protein; MitoSOX: red mitochondrial superoxide probe; MKI67: antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki 67; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; O4: oligodendrocyte marker O4; OLIG2: oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2; ON: optic nerve; OPA1: OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase; OPC: oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; PDL: poly-D-lysine; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RGC: retinal ganglion cell; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR: real time polymerase chain reaction; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOD2: superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; TUBB: tubulin, beta; TUBB3: tubulin, beta 3 class III.	2022	04	07	Autophagy	Yazdankhah	Meysam
33952317	10.1186/s13148-021-01091-9	Methylated markers accurately distinguish primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) from other CNS tumors.	Definitive diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) requires invasive surgical brain biopsy, causing treatment delays. In this paper, we identified and validated tumor-specific markers that can distinguish PCNSL from other CNS tumors in tissues. In a pilot study, we tested these newly identified markers in plasma. The Methylation Outlier Detector program was used to identify markers in TCGA dataset of 48 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 656 glioblastomas and lower-grade gliomas. Eight methylated markers clearly distinguished DLBCL from gliomas. Marker performance was verified (ROC-AUC of ≥ 0.989) in samples from several GEO datasets (95 PCNSL; 2112 other primary CNS tumors of 11 types). Next, we developed a novel, efficient assay called Tailed Amplicon Multiplexed-Methylation-Specific PCR (TAM-MSP), which uses two of the methylation markers, cg0504 and SCG3 triplexed with ACTB. FFPE tissue sections (25 cases each) of PCNSL and eight types of other primary CNS tumors were analyzed using TAM-MSP. TAM-MSP distinguished PCNSL from the other primary CNS tumors with 100% accuracy (AUC = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, P &lt; 0.001). The TAM-MSP assay also detected as few as 5 copies of fully methylated plasma DNA spiked into 0.5 ml of healthy plasma. In a pilot study of plasma from 15 PCNSL, 5 other CNS tumors and 6 healthy individuals, methylation in cg0504 and SCG3 was detectable in 3/15 PCNSL samples (20%). The Methylation Outlier Detector program identified methylated markers that distinguish PCNSL from other CNS tumors with accuracy. The high level of accuracy achieved by these markers was validated in tissues by a novel method, TAM-MSP. These studies lay a strong foundation for a liquid biopsy-based test to detect PCNSL-specific circulating tumor DNA.	2022	01	24	Clin Epigenetics	Downs	Bradley M
34598060	10.1016/j.ctarc.2021.100465	Prioritising breast cancer theranostics: A current medical longing in oncology.	The Theranostics approach has full potential to completely transform the contemporary medicine system to a patient-centric approach, as it is emerging in quite efficient manner, over the past few years. The primary impetus of this review is to analyse the patent growth in the domain of breast cancer theranostics. This wholesome analysis provides an insight into the current technological and R &amp; D advancement over the years, in breast cancer theranostics. Thus, guide the end-users in getting the conclusion for policymaking and other public recommendations. This patent assessment also foretells about the future trends to carry out further achievements. Due to their easy availability, information richness, &amp; versatility, patent's role in R&amp;D policy has been emphasized by stake holders of innovation including scientists time to time. Graphical Abstract: The figure illustrates the applied technologies used for breast cancer theranostics by top three forward cited patents (A) The oligonucleotides with specific sequences (comprised of at least one of DNA, RNA, PNA. LNA, UNA or combination)<sup>1</sup> are capable of binding a targeted tumor protein (PARP1, HISTIHIB, HISTIHID, NCL, FBL, SFPQ, RPL12, ACTB, HIST1H4A, SSBP1, NONO, H2AFJ, and DDX21, forming a tumor protein complex or subunit or their fragments and might block the tumoral activity.

34925435	10.3389/fgene.2021.677650	Genetic Landscape of Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Systemic Review and Association Analysis With Next-Generation Sequencing.	In our research, we screened 1,495 documents, compiled the whole-exome sequencing data of several studies, formed a data set including 92 observations of RRDLBCL (Relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and performed association analysis on the high-frequency mutations among them. The most common mutations in the data set include TTN, KMT2D, TP53, IGLL5, CREBBP, BCL2, MYD88, and SOCS1 etc. Among these, CREBBP, KMT2D, and BCL2 have a strong association with each other, and SOCS1 has a strong association with genes such as STAT6, ACTB, CIITA, ITPKB, and GNA13. TP53 lacks significant associations with most genes. Through SOM clustering, expression-level analysis and protein interaction analysis of common gene mutations, we believe that RRDLBCL can be divided into five main types. We tested the function of the model and described the clinical characteristics of each subtype through a targeted sequencing RRDLBCL cohort of 96 patients. The classification is stated as follows: 1) JAK-STAT-related type: including STAT6, SOCS1, CIITA, etc. The genetic lineage is similar to PMBL and cHL. Retrospective analysis suggests that this subtype responds poorly to induction therapy (R-CHOP, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). 2) BCL-CREBBP type: Epigenetic mutations such as KMT2D and CREBBP are more common in this type, and are often accompanied by BCL2 and EZH2 mutations. 3) MCD type: including MYD88 and CD79B, PIM1 is more common in this subtype. 4) TP53 mutation: TP53 mutant patients, which suggests the worst prognosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and worst response to CART treatment. 5) Undefined type (Sparse item type): Major Genetic Change Lacking Type, which has a better prognosis and better response to CART treatment. We also reviewed the literature from recent years concerning the previously mentioned common gene mutations.	2021	12	21	Front Genet	Gao	Fan
31242129	10.1080/15548627.2019.1635380	<i>MIR145-3p</i> promotes autophagy and enhances bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma by targeting <i>HDAC4</i>.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with poor survival. Autophagy, a stress-responsive catabolic process mediated by lysosomal activity, plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of MM. Growing evidence has indicated that dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with the aberrant autophagy in various human cancers. However, to date, few miRNAs have been reported to directly modulate autophagy in the pathobiology of MM. In this study, we investigated the role of <i>MIR145-3p</i> (microRNA 145-3p) in MM, with focus on cellular processes autophagy and cell death. Our results provided evidence that downregulation of <i>MIR145-3p</i> expression was associated with disease progression in human MM. <i>MIR145-3p</i> triggered autophagic flux through direct targeting of <i>HDAC4</i> (histone deacetylase 4) in MM cells, leading to enhanced apoptosis. Silencing <i>HDAC4</i> recapitulated the effects of <i>MIR145-3p</i>, whereas enforced expression of <i>HDAC4</i> abrogated the effects of <i>MIR145-3p</i>. Furthermore, we showed that suppression of <i>HDAC4</i> by <i>MIR145-3p</i> resulted in upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BCL2L11 and caused MTORC1 inactivation, which in turn led to enhanced autophagy and cell death. Importantly, we demonstrated that <i>MIR145-3p</i> mimic could potentiate the anti-MM activity of bortezomib in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. Overall, our findings indicate that <i>MIR145-3p</i> exerted a tumor suppression function in MM by inducing autophagic cell death and suggest that <i>MIR145-3p</i>-based targeted therapy would represent a novel strategy for MM treatment.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; 3'-UTR: 3'-untranslated region; 7-AAD: 7-aminoactinomycin D; ACTB: actin beta; ANXA5: annexin A5; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; B2M: beta-2-microglobulin; BAF: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BCL2L11: BCL2 like 11; Bort: bortezomib; CASP3: caspase 3; CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit-8; CQ: chloroquine; Ct: threshold cycle; ctrl: control; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HDAC4: histone deacetylase 4; ISS: International Staging System; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; miRNAs: microRNAs; <i>MIR145-3p</i>: microRNA 145-3p; MM: multiple myeloma; mRNA: messenger RNA; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; PCs: plasma cells; PFS: progression-free survival; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription PCR; RPS6KB1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SD: standard deviation; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; STV: starvation; TUBB: tubulin beta class I.	2021	06	07	Autophagy	Wu	Hongkun
32349449	10.3390/ijms21093093	Prevalence of Cytoplasmic Actin Mutations in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma: A Functional Assessment Based on Actin Three-Dimensional Structures.	Mutations in actins have been linked to several developmental diseases. Their occurrence across different cancers has, however, not been investigated. Using the cBioPortal database we show that human actins are infrequently mutated in patient samples of various cancers types. Nevertheless, ranking these studies by mutational frequency suggest that some have a higher percentage of patients with <i>ACTB</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> mutations. Within studies on hematological cancers, mutations in <i>ACTB</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> are associated with lymphoid cancers since none have currently been reported in myeloid cancers. Within the different types of lymphoid cancers <i>ACTB</i> mutations are most frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and <i>ACTG1</i> mutations in multiple myeloma. We mapped the ACTB and ACTG1 mutations found in these two cancer types on the 3D-structure of actin showing they are in regions important for actin polymer formation or binding to myosin. The potential effects of the mutations on actin properties imply that mutations in cytoplasmic actins deserve dedicated research in DLBCL and multiple myeloma.	2021	02	01	Int J Mol Sci	Witjes	Laura
32565964	10.3892/ol.2020.11552	Comprehensive characterization of driver genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common hematological malignancy and is one of the most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Large-scale genomic studies have defined genetic drivers of DLBCL and their association with functional and clinical outcomes. However, the lymphomagenesis of DLBCL is yet to be fully understood. In the present study, four computational tools OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, integrated Cancer Genome Score and Driver Genes and Pathways were used to detect driver genes and driver pathways involved in DLBCL. The aforementioned tools were also used to perform an integrative investigation of driver genes, including co-expression network, protein-protein interaction, copy number variation and survival analyses. The present study identified 208 driver genes and 31 driver pathways in DLBCL. <i>IGLL5, MLL2, BTG2, B2M, PIM1, CARD11</i> were the top five frequently mutated genes in DLBCL. <i>NOTCH3, LAMC1, COL4A1, PDGFRB</i> and <i>KDR</i> were the 5 hub genes in the blue module that were associated with patient age. <i>TP53, MYC, EGFR, PTEN, IL6, STAT3, MAPK8, TNF</i> and <i>CDH1</i> were at the core of the protein-protein interaction network. <i>PRDM1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, TNFAIP3, RSPO3</i> were the top five frequently deleted driver genes in DLBCL, while <i>ACTB, BTG2, PLET1, CARD11, DIXDC1</i> were the top five frequently amplified driver genes in DLBCL. High <i>EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA</i> and <i>RECQL4</i> expression was associated with decreased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. High <i>XPO1</i> and <i>LYN</i> expression were associated with increased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. The present study improves the understanding of the biological processes and pathways involved in lymphomagenesis. The driver genes, <i>EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA, RECQL4, XPO1</i> and <i>LYN</i>, pave the way for developing prognostic biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for DLBCL.	2020	09	28	Oncol Lett	Fan	Zheng
31108950	10.3390/genes10050376	Identification and Validation of Novel Reference Genes in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Droplet Digital PCR.	Droplet digital PCR is the most robust method for absolute nucleic acid quantification. However, RNA is a very versatile molecule and its abundance is tissue-dependent. RNA quantification is dependent on a reference control to estimate the abundance. Additionally, in cancer, many cellular processes are deregulated which consequently affects the gene expression profiles. In this work, we performed microarray data mining of different childhood cancers and healthy controls. We selected four genes that showed no gene expression variations (<i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i>) and four classical reference genes (<i>ACTB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>RPL4</i> and RPS18). Gene expression was validated in 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by means of droplet digital PCR. We observed that <i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i> were expressed ~100 times less than <i>ACTB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>RPL4</i> and <i>RPS18</i>. However, we observed excellent correlations among the new reference genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). We propose that <i>PSMB6</i>, <i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>UBQLN2</i> and <i>UQCR2</i> are housekeeping genes with low expression in childhood cancer.	2020	02	14	Genes (Basel)	Villegas-Ruíz	Vanessa
29433359	10.1080/15548627.2017.1390636	Piperlongumine restores the balance of autophagy and apoptosis by increasing BCL2 phosphorylation in rotenone-induced Parkinson disease models.	Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease and is caused by genetics, environmental factors and aging, with few treatments currently available. Apoptosis and macroautophagy/autophagy play critical roles in PD pathogenesis; as such, modulating their balance is a potential treatment strategy. BCL2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) is a key molecule regulating this balance. Piperlongumine (PLG) is an alkaloid extracted from Piper longum L. that has antiinflammatory and anticancer effects. The present study investigated the protective effects of PLG in rotenone-induced PD cell and mouse models. We found that PLG administration (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 4 wk attenuated motor deficits in mice and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra induced by oral administration of rotenone (10 mg/kg) for 6 wk. PLG improved cell viability and enhanced mitochondrial function in primary neurons and SK-N-SH cells. These protective effects were exerted via inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy through enhancement of BCL2 phosphorylation at Ser70. These results demonstrate that PLG exerts therapeutic effects in a rotenone-induced PD models by restoring the balance between apoptosis and autophagy. 6-OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine; ACTB, actin, beta; BafA1, bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BAK1, BCL2-antagonist/killer 1; BAX, BCL2-associated X protein; BCL2, B cell leukemia/lymphoma2; BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy related; CoQ10, coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>; COX4I1/COX IV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; CsA, cyclosporine A; ED50, 50% effective dose; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; JC-1, tetraethylbenz-imidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; l-dopa, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine; MAPK8/JNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NFE2L2/NRF2, nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PD, Parkinson disease; PLG, piperlongumine; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PI, propidium iodide; PtdIns3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PTX, paclitaxel; Rap, rapamycin; SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome 1; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; WIPI2, WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2; ZFYVE1/DFCP1, zinc finger, FYVE domain containing 1.	2019	10	03	Autophagy	Liu	Jia
27868373	10.1002/ajmg.a.38057	Acute myeloid leukemia in Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome.	Baraitser-Winter malformation syndrome (BWMS), Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FA), and craniofrontofacial syndromes (CFFs) have all been recently proposed to be part of the same phenotypic spectrum of Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF), which is characterized by facial dysmorphism, ocular coloboma, brain malformations, and intellectual disabilities. In addition to that, the recent discovery of missense mutations in one of the two ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic β- and γ-acting-encoding genes ACTB (7p22.1) and ACTG1 (17q25.3) in patients carrying a clinical diagnosis of BWSM, FA, or CCF has provided further evidence that these clinical conditions do indeed belong to the same entity at the molecular level. Two cases of BWCFF patients presenting with malignancies (i.e., acute lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous lymphoma) have been published thus far. Here, we report a 21-year-old female with molecularly confirmed FA, who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The present finding may indicate that actinopathies could be cancer-predisposing syndromes although small numbers and publication bias should be taken into account. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2017	10	24	Am J Med Genet A	Cianci	Paola
28807016	10.1186/s12885-017-3536-6	Endogenous controls of gene expression in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced T-cell lymphoma in p53-deficient mice.	Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an increasingly important technique for gene expression profiling because it can provide insights into complex biological and pathological processes and be used to predict disease or treatment outcomes. Although normalized data are necessary for an accurate estimation of mRNA expression levels, several pieces of evidence suggest that the expression of so-called housekeeping genes is not stable. This study aimed to validate reference genes for the normalization of real-time PCR in an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced T-cell lymphoma mouse model. T-cell lymphomas were generated in p53-deficient mice by treatment with 37.5 mg/kg MNU. Thymus and spleen were identified as the primary target organs with the highest incidences of lymphomas. We analyzed the RNA expression levels of eight potential endogenous reference genes (Gapdh, Rn18s, Actb, Hprt, B2M, Rplp0, Gusb, Ctbp1). The expression stabilities of these reference genes were tested at different time points after MNU treatment using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. A total of 65% of MNU-treated mice developed T-cell lymphomas, with the spleen and thymus as the major target organs. All candidate reference genes were amplified efficiently by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene stability evaluation after MNU treatment and during lymphomagenesis revealed that Ctbp1 and Rplp0 were the most stably expressed genes in the thymus and spleen, respectively. RT-PCR of thymus RNA using two additional sets of primer confirmed that Ctbp1 was the most stable of all the candidate reference genes. We provided suitable endogenous controls for gene expression studies in the T-cell lymphoma model.	2018	05	03	BMC Cancer	Wu	Xi
26852652	10.1016/j.bcmd.2015.11.006	ETV6/RUNX1 transcript is a target of RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The oncofetal RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 (IGF2 mRNA binding protein 1) is overexpressed in a subset of cancers and promotes cell cycle, migration and aggressive phenotype by regulating post-transcriptionally a number of key mRNAs (e. g, ACTB, CD44, CTNNB1, KRAS, MAPK4, MYC, PTEN and others). IGF2BP1 is also overexpressed in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the biological significance of this phenomenon has not been addressed so far. We have identified leukemia fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA to be highly enriched in immunoprecipitated fraction of endogenous IGF2BP1 from a model cell line REH and t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL samples. Furthermore, downregulation of IGF2BP1 by two-fold has resulted in a corresponding decrease of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA validating this transcript as a target of IGF2BP1 protein in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. These data infer that IGF2BP1 is a potent regulator of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA stability and potentially link this evolutionary-highly conserved protein to cell transformation events in ETV6/RUNX1-mediated leukemogenesis of t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. 	2016	10	25	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Stoskus	Mindaugas
25052316	10.1038/ejhg.2014.95	Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome: delineation of the spectrum in 42 cases.	Baraitser-Winter, Fryns-Aftimos and cerebrofrontofacial syndrome types 1 and 3 have recently been associated with heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in one of the two ubiquitous cytoplasmic actin-encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1 that encode β- and γ-actins. We present detailed phenotypic descriptions and neuroimaging on 36 patients analyzed by our group and six cases from the literature with a molecularly proven actinopathy (9 ACTG1 and 33 ACTB). The major clinical anomalies are striking dysmorphic facial features with hypertelorism, broad nose with large tip and prominent root, congenital non-myopathic ptosis, ridged metopic suture and arched eyebrows. Iris or retinal coloboma is present in many cases, as is sensorineural deafness. Cleft lip and palate, hallux duplex, congenital heart defects and renal tract anomalies are seen in some cases. Microcephaly may develop with time. Nearly all patients with ACTG1 mutations, and around 60% of those with ACTB mutations have some degree of pachygyria with anteroposterior severity gradient, rarely lissencephaly or neuronal heterotopia. Reduction of shoulder girdle muscle bulk and progressive joint stiffness is common. Early muscular involvement, occasionally with congenital arthrogryposis, may be present. Progressive, severe dystonia was seen in one family. Intellectual disability and epilepsy are variable in severity and largely correlate with CNS anomalies. One patient developed acute lymphocytic leukemia, and another a cutaneous lymphoma, indicating that actinopathies may be cancer-predisposing disorders. Considering the multifaceted role of actins in cell physiology, we hypothesize that some clinical manifestations may be partially mutation specific. Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome is our suggested designation for this clinical entity. 	2015	10	22	Eur J Hum Genet	Verloes	Alain
25696013		Selection of superior reference genes' combination for quantitative real-time PCR in B-cell lymphomas.	Normalization of real-time quantitative PCR data to appropriate reference genes is crucial to accurately interpret results. Many genes commonly used as reference standards do not perform as expected, depending on cell type and experimental design. In our previous work, we addressed the issue of suitable reference genes for lymphoid tissue and successfully applied the normalization factor-based approach to discriminate lymphoid malignancies according to their cyclin D1 mRNA level. Here, we addressed the problem of reference gene selection and sufficient number on an enlarged sample set with seven candidate genes. The experimental set included 165 samples of spleens, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with different types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas along with non-neoplastic lymphoid specimens. For the first time, we compared all major stability ranking algorithms of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) applets geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder and tested candidate reference genes on a large and heterogeneous set of fresh clinical lymphoid samples. We concluded that a normalization-based approach using three reference genes (YWHAZ, UBC and ACTB) allows for robust reduction of the variance in real-time PCR results and that the further addition of reference genes does not improve data normalization. This creates a clinically applicable tool for PCR-based lymphoma diagnostics. 	2015	12	15	Ann Clin Lab Sci	Potashnikova	Daria
25715028	10.1080/15548627.2015.1017191	BAX and BAK1 are dispensable for ABT-737-induced dissociation of the BCL2-BECN1 complex and autophagy.	Disruption of the complex of BECN1 with BCL2 or BCL2L1/BCL-XL is an essential switch that turns on cellular autophagy in response to environmental stress or treatment with BH3 peptidomimetics. Recently, it has been proposed that BCL2 and BCL2L1/BCL-XL may inhibit autophagy indirectly through a mechanism dependent on the proapoptotic BCL2 family members, BAX and BAK1. Here we report that the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, induces autophagy in parallel with disruption of BCL2-BECN1 binding in 2 different apoptosis-deficient cell types lacking BAX and BAK1, namely in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells and in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. We conclude that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 induces autophagy through a BAX and BAK1-independent mechanism that likely involves disruption of BECN1 binding to antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. 	2016	03	07	Autophagy	Pedro	Jose Manuel Bravo-San
25984893	10.1080/15548627.2015.1034402	The GST-BHMT assay reveals a distinct mechanism underlying proteasome inhibition-induced macroautophagy in mammalian cells.	By monitoring the fragmentation of a GST-BHMT (a protein fusion of glutathionine S-transferase N-terminal to betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase) reporter in lysosomes, the GST-BHMT assay has previously been established as an endpoint, cargo-based assay for starvation-induced autophagy that is largely nonselective. Here, we demonstrate that under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inhibition by either pharmaceutical or genetic manipulations induces similar autophagy-dependent GST-BHMT processing. However, mechanistically this proteasome inhibition-induced autophagy is different from that induced by starvation as it does not rely on regulation by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase]) and PRKAA/AMPK (protein kinase, AMP-activated, α catalytic subunit), the upstream central sensors of cellular nutrition and energy status, but requires the presence of the cargo receptors SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) and NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) that are normally involved in the selective autophagy pathway. Further, it depends on ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress signaling, in particular ERN1/IRE1 (endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1) and its main downstream effector MAPK8/JNK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 8), but not XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), by regulating the phosphorylation-dependent disassociation of BCL2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) from BECN1 (Beclin 1, autophagy related). Moreover, the multimerization domain of GST-BHMT is required for its processing in response to proteasome inhibition, in contrast to its dispensable role in starvation-induced processing. Together, these findings support a model in which under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inactivation induces autophagy-dependent processing of the GST-BHMT reporter through a distinct mechanism that bears notable similarity with the yeast Cvt (cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting) pathway, and suggest the GST-BHMT reporter might be employed as a convenient assay to study selective macroautophagy in mammalian cells. 	2016	02	23	Autophagy	Rui	Yan-Ning
26043155	10.1080/15548627.2015.1055439	TNFAIP3 promotes survival of CD4 T cells by restricting MTOR and promoting autophagy.	Autophagy plays important roles in metabolism, differentiation, and survival in T cells. TNFAIP3/A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that is thought to be a negative regulator of autophagy in cell lines. However, the role of TNFAIP3 in autophagy remains unclear. To determine whether TNFAIP3 regulates autophagy in CD4 T cells, we first analyzed Tnfaip3-deficient naïve CD4 T cells in vitro. We demonstrated that Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited reduced MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) puncta formation, increased mitochondrial content, and exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These results indicate that TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in CD4 T cells. We then investigated the mechanism by which TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy signaling. We found that TNFAIP3 bound to the MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complex and that Tnfaip3-deficient cells displayed enhanced ubiquitination of the MTOR complex and MTOR activity. To confirm the effects of enhanced MTOR activity in Tnfaip3-deficient cells, we analyzed cell survival following treatment with Torin1, an MTOR inhibitor. Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited fewer cell numbers than the control cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the impaired survival of Tnfaip3-deficient cells was ameliorated with Torin1 treatment in vitro and in vivo. The effect of Torin1 was abolished by Atg5 deficiency. Thus, enhanced MTOR activity regulates the survival of Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells. Taken together, our findings illustrate that TNFAIP3 restricts MTOR signaling and promotes autophagy, providing new insight into the manner in which MTOR and autophagy regulate survival in CD4 T cells. 	2016	04	18	Autophagy	Matsuzawa	Yu
24275555	10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.11.021	Peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure induces sex-specific programming of disease susceptibilities in adult mouse offspring.	Vulnerability of the fetus upon maternal obesity can potentially occur during all developmental phases. We aimed at elaborating longer-term health outcomes of fetal overnutrition during the earliest stages of development. We utilized Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice to induce pre-conceptional and gestational obesity and followed offspring outcomes in the absence of any postnatal obesogenic influences. Male adult offspring developed overweight, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis; all these features were not observed in females. Instead, they showed impaired fasting glucose and a reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. Influences of the interaction of maternal diet∗sex concerned offspring genes involved in fatty liver disease, lipid droplet size regulation and fat mass expansion. These data suggest that a peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure is sufficient to shape offspring gene expression patterns and health outcomes in a sex- and organ-specific manner, indicating varying developmental vulnerabilities between sexes towards metabolic disease in response to maternal overnutrition. 	2014	04	16	Biochim Biophys Acta	Dahlhoff	M
24418552	10.1016/j.virol.2013.11.022	HTLV-1 infects human mesenchymal stromal cell in vitro and modifies their phenotypic characteristics.	The typical characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be affected by inflammatory microenvironment; however, the exact contribution of HTLV-1 to MSC dysfunction remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that MSC cell surface molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are upregulated by contact with HTLV-1, and HLA-DR was most highly expressed in MSCs co-cultured with MT2 cells. The expression levels of VCAM-1 and HLA-DR were increased in MSCs cultured in the presence of PBMCs isolated from HTLV-1-infected symptomatic individuals compared with those cultured with cells from asymptomatic infected individuals or healthy subjects. HTLV-1 does not impair the MSC differentiation process into osteocytes and adipocytes. In addition, MSCs were efficiently infected with HTLV-1 in vitro through direct contact with HTLV-1-infected cells; however, cell-free virus particles were not capable of causing infection. In summary, HTLV-1 can alter MSC function, and this mechanism may contribute to the pathogenesis of this viral infection. 	2014	04	07	Virology	Rodrigues	Evandra Strazza
23266771	10.1016/j.cca.2012.12.012	ACTB in cancer.	Beta-actin (ACTB) has traditionally been regarded as an endogenous housekeeping gene and has been widely used as a reference gene/protein in quantifying expression levels in tumors. However, ACTB is closely associated with a variety of cancers and accumulating evidence indicates that ACTB is de-regulated in liver, melanoma, renal, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, breast, prostate, ovarian cancers, leukemia and lymphoma. ACTB is generally found to be up-regulated in the majority of tumor cells and tissues. The abnormal expression and polymerization of ACTB and the resulting changes to the cytoskeleton are revealed to be associated with the invasiveness and metastasis of cancers. The current review explores relevant mechanisms, integrates current understandings, and provides suggestions for future studies of the roles of ACTB in tumors.	2013	08	27	Clin Chim Acta	Guo	Chunmei
23326330	10.1371/journal.pone.0052384	Activated ERM protein plays a critical role in drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25.	We have previously demonstrated that the CCR9/CCL25 signaling pathway plays an important role in drug resistance in human acute T-lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) by inducing activation of ERM protein with polarized distribution in T-ALL cell line MOLT4. However, the mechanism of action of the activated ERM protein in the drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25 remains uncharacterized. Here we investigated the mechanism of CCR9/CCL25-initiated drug resistance in CCR9-high-expressing T-ALL cells. Our results showed that 1) the function of P-gp was increased after treatment with CCL25; 2) P-gp colocalized and co-immunoprecipitated with p-ERM and F-actin in CCL25 treated cells; and 3) ERM-shRNA conferred drug sensitivity coincident with release of ERM interactions with P-gp and F-actin after treatment with CCL25. These data suggest it is pivotal that P-gp associate with the F-actin cytoskeleton through p-ERM in CCR9/CCL25 induced multidrug resistance of T-ALL cells. Strategies aimed at inhibiting P-gp-F-actin cytoskeleton association may be helpful in increasing the efficiency of therapies in T-ALL.	2013	07	05	PLoS One	Zhang	Li
23849470	10.1186/1756-8722-6-52	Protein biomarkers distinguish between high- and low-risk pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a tissue specific manner.	The current study evaluated the differential expression detected in the proteomic profiles of low risk- and high risk- ALL pediatric patients to characterize candidate biomarkers related to diagnosis, prognosis and patient targeted therapy. Bone marrow and peripheral blood plasma and cell lysates samples were obtained from pediatric patients with low- (LR) and high-risk (HR) ALL at diagnosis. As controls, non-leukemic pediatric patients were studied. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out by G- banding and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization. Differential proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The differential expression of certain proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The obtained data revealed that CLUS, CERU, APOE, APOA4, APOA1, GELS, S10A9, AMBP, ACTB, CATA and AFAM proteins play a significant role in leukemia prognosis, potentially serving as distinctive biomarkers for leukemia aggressiveness, or as suppressor proteins in HR-ALL cases. In addition, vitronectin and plasminogen probably contributed to leukemogenesis, whilst bicaudal D-related protein 1 could afford a significant biomarker for pediatric ALL therapeutics. 	2014	05	05	J Hematol Oncol	Braoudaki	Maria
22343534	10.1073/pnas.1121343109	Discovery and prioritization of somatic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by whole-exome sequencing.	To gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.	2012	05	04	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Lohr	Jens G
19309015	10.1002/elps.200800508	2-D PAGE-based comparison of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in sensitive and resistant mantle cell lymphoma.	Although gene expression following bortezomib treatment has been previously explored, direct effects of bortezomib-induced proteasome inhibition on protein level has not been analyzed so far. Using 2-D PAGE in five mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, we screened for cellular protein level alterations following treatment with 25 nM bortezomib for up to 4 h. Using MS, we identified 38 of the 41 most prominent reliably detected protein spots. Twenty-one were affected in all cell lines, whereas the remaining 20 protein spots were exclusively altered in sensitive cell lines. Western blot analysis was performed for 17 of the 38 identified proteins and 70.6% of the observed protein level alterations in 2-D gels was verified. All cell lines exhibited alterations of the cellular protein levels of heat shock-induced protein species (HSPA9, HSP7C, HSPA5, HSPD1), whereas sensitive cell lines also displayed altered cellular protein levels of energy metabolism (ATP5B, AK5, TPI1, ENO-1, ALDOC, GAPDH), RNA and transcriptional regulation (HNRPL, SFRS12) and cell division (NEBL, ACTB, SMC1A, C20orf23) as well as tumor suppressor genes (ENO-1, FH). These proteins clustered in a tight interaction network centered on the major cellular checkpoints TP53. The results were confirmed in primary mantle cell lymphoma, thus confirming the critical role of these candidate proteins of proteasome inhibition.	2009	08	18	Electrophoresis	Weinkauf	Marc
20031021	10.1016/j.rbmo.2009.09.024	Apoptosis in normal ovaries of women with and without endometriosis.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors predisposing to implants of endometriotic lesions in normal ovarian cortexes of women with and without endometriosis by assessing the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors and follicular density. Ovarian biopsies were performed during laparoscopy in 18 patients with endometrioma and in 10 healthy women. Detection of apoptosis was performed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay. p53 and BCL2 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate BAX , BAK , BCL2 , BCL-XL , survivin and beta-actin ( ACTB ) expression. The p53 protein was positive in a significantly higher number of secondary follicles, whereas the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein was positive in all follicles in unaffected tissue of endometriotic women, compared with the controls. Overexpression of the BCL2 and survivin genes and a decreased BAX and BAK gene expression were observed in the endometriotic group although only the difference in survivin expression was significant (P = 0.016). The BCL2 / BAX ratio showed an increased value in the ovarian cortex in controls compared with endometriosis patients. In conclusion, the reduction of apoptosis in unaffected tissue in women with endometriosis suggests that they may be predisposed to develop endometriosis.	2010	02	25	Reprod Biomed Online	Depalo	Raffaella
17823310	10.1182/blood-2007-04-087775	HGAL, a lymphoma prognostic biomarker, interacts with the cytoskeleton and mediates the effects of IL-6 on cell migration.	HGAL is a newly identified germinal center (GC)-specific gene whose expression by the tumor cells correlates with a favorable prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. The function of HGAL is unknown. Previous studies demonstrated that HGAL is dispensable for GC formation, immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. Herein, we identify a role for HGAL in the regulation of cell motility. We demonstrate that IL-6 induces the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue of the HGAL protein via the Lyn kinase, and promotes its relocalization from the cytoplasm to podosome-like structures. Further, IL-6-induced HGAL phosphorylation increases its interaction with myosin II and is associated with inhibition of cell migration. Knockdown of endogenous HGAL ameliorates IL-6-induced inhibition of cell migration, whereas overexpression of HGAL imparts inhibitory effects of IL-6 on cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that HGAL is involved in negative regulation of lymphocyte migration, thus constraining lymphocytes to the GC. Inhibition of lymphocyte migration might contribute to the less aggressive clinical behavior of HGAL-expressing lymphomas.	2008	02	26	Blood	Lu	Xiaoqing
16105984	10.1182/blood-2005-03-1204	p130Cas mediates the transforming properties of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase.	Translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been described in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) and in stromal tumors. The most frequent translocation, t(2;5), generates the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Along with transformation, NPM-ALK induces morphologic changes in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells, suggesting a direct role of ALK in cell shaping. In this study, we used a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach to search for proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and identified p130Cas (p130 Crk-associated substrate) as a novel interactor of NPM-ALK. In 293 cells and in fibroblasts as well as in human ALK-positive lymphoma cell lines, NPM-ALK was able to bind p130Cas and to induce its phosphorylation. Both of the effects were dependent on ALK kinase activity and on the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), since no binding or phosphorylation was found with the kinase-dead mutant NPM-ALK(K210R) or in the presence of a Grb2 dominant-negative protein. Phosphorylation of p130Cas by NPM-ALK was partially independent from Src (tyrosine kinase pp60c-src) kinase activity, as it was still detectable in Syf-/- cells. Finally, p130Cas-/- (also known as Bcar1-/-) fibroblasts expressing NPM-ALK showed impaired actin filament depolymerization and were no longer transformed compared with wild-type cells, indicating an essential role of p130Cas activation in ALK-mediated transformation.	2006	01	18	Blood	Ambrogio	Chiara
1505215	10.1159/000133336	Sublocalization of an invasion-inducing locus and other genes on human chromosome 7.	By somatic cell fusion studies between noninvasive mouse T-lymphoma cells and invasive human activated normal T-cells we have previously shown that the genetic information responsible for the induction of invasive and metastatic potential in interspecies T-cell hybrids is located on human chromosome 7. Apparently, genes derived from normal activated T-cells are dominantly expressed in the hybrids and control the invasive and, as a consequence, metastatic potential of these T-lymphoma cells. To sublocalize the invasion-inducing locus on chromosome 7 we have generated hybrids that harbor only specific regions of human chromosome 7 with or without a small fragment of human chromosome 21. Analysis of these hybrids revealed that the invasion-inducing locus maps to 7p12----cen. The human DNA complement of the hybrids was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a large panel of chromosome 7-specific DNA probes. Several of these genes could be further sublocalized. These included: ARAF2 to 7p12----cen, D7S21 to 7pter----p12, ACTB to 7p15----p12, EGFR to 7p12, MDH2 to 7cen----q22, and PDGFA to 7pter----p15.	1992	09	22	Cytogenet Cell Genet	Habets	G G
34265801	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001780	Plasticity of Mature B Cells Between Follicular and Classic Hodgkin Lymphomas: A Series of 22 Cases Expanding the Spectrum of Transdifferentiation.	Follicular lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma can be associated in composite and/or sequential lymphomas. Common IGH and BCL2 rearrangements have already been identified between both contingents of these entities, but mutation profiles have not yet been investigated. The main objective of this study was to analyze the transdifferentiation process that may occur between Hodgkin and follicular contingents in sequential and composite lymphomas to better characterize these entities. From 2004 to 2020, a retrospective multicentric study was performed, including 9 composite and 13 sequential lymphomas. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, polymerase chain reaction of IGH and IGK rearrangements, next-generation sequencing of IGK rearrangement, and targeted next-generation sequencing (TNGS) on a panel of genes frequently mutated in lymphomas were performed on each contingent of composite and sequential lymphomas. For TNGS, each contingent was isolated by laser capture microdissection. Clinical presentation and evolution were more aggressive in sequential than composite lymphomas. By fluorescent in situ hybridization, common rearrangements of BCL6 and BCL2 were identified between both contingents. Similarly, a common clonal relationship was established by evaluating IGH and IGK rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing. By TNGS, the same pathogenic variants were identified in both contingents in the following genes: CREBBP, KMT2D, BCL2, EP300, SF3B1, SOCS1, ARID1A, and BCOR. Specific pathogenic variants for each contingent were also identified: XPO1 for Hodgkin lymphoma contingent and FOXO1, TNFRSF14 for follicular lymphoma contingent. This study reinforces the hypothesis of a transdifferentiation process between Hodgkin and follicular contingent of sequential/composite lymphomas.	2022	02	14	Am J Surg Pathol	Trecourt	Alexis
34560683	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001813	A Comprehensive Clinicopathologic and Molecular Study of 19 Primary Effusion Lymphomas in HIV-infected Patients.	Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is associated with human herpesvirus 8 and frequently with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We report here a single-center series of 19 human immunodeficiency virus-associated PELs, including 14 EBV+ and 5 EBV- PELs. The objectives were to describe the clinicopathologic features of PELs, with a focus on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, to search for genetic alterations by targeted deep sequencing analysis, and to compare the features between EBV+ and EBV- cases. All the patients were male, and the median age at diagnosis was 47 years old (interquartile range: 40 to 56 y). Reflecting the terminal B-cell differentiation, immunophenotypic profiles showed low expression levels of B-cell markers, including CD19 (0/19), CD20 (1/19), CD79a (0/19), PAX5 (1/19), BOB1 (3/19), and OCT2 (4/19), contrasting with a common expression of CD38 (10/19), CD138 (7/19), and IRF4/MUM1 (18/19). We observed a frequent aberrant expression of T-cell markers, especially CD3 (10/19), and less frequently CD2 (2/19), CD4 (3/19), CD5 (1/19), and CD8 (0/19). Only 2 cases were PD-L1 positive on tumor cells and none PD-1 positive. With respect to immune cells, 3 samples tested positive for PD-L1 and 5 for PD-1. Our 36-gene lymphopanel revealed 7 distinct variants in 5/10 PELs, with either a single or 2 mutations per sample: B2M (n=2), CD58 (n=1), EP300 (n=1), TNFAIP3 (n=1), ARID1A (n=1), and TP53 (n=1). Finally, we did not observe any major clinical, pathologic, or immunohistochemical differences between EBV+ and EBV- PELs and the outcome was similar (2-y overall survival probability of 61.9% [95% confidence interval, 31.2-82.1] vs. 60.0% [95% confidence interval, 12.6-88.2], respectively, P=0.62).	2022	03	07	Am J Surg Pathol	Calvani	Julien
34649275	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005316	Worse outcome and distinct mutational pattern in follicular lymphoma with anti-HBc positivity.	Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), mainly for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). We studied a cohort of 121 patients with FL for HBV infection status, clinical features, and gene mutational profile. Anti-HBc was detectable in 16 patients (13.2%), although all had undetectable HBV DNA. Anti-HBcore+ (anti-HBc+) cases presented with older age at diagnosis than anti-HBc- cases (68.1 vs 57.2 years; P = .007) and higher β2-microglobulin (56.3% vs 28.9%; P = .04). All patients included in the study fulfilled criteria for treatment and received therapy with rituximab or rituximab-containing chemotherapy. There were no episodes of HBV reactivation or HBV hepatitis during treatment and/or maintenance. Remarkably, anti-HBc+ patients had significantly lower 10-year progression-free survival (PFS; 12.9% vs 58.3%; P &lt; .0001) and overall survival (OS; 22.0% vs 86.2%; P &lt; .0001), that remained at multivariate analysis. Gene mutational profiling of all cases showed that anti-HBc+ cases had higher incidence of ARID1A mutations and absence of EP300 mutations, 2 key epigenetic regulators in FL. Overall, our study shows that FL patients with resolved HBV infection have a worse outcome independently of other well-known clinical risk factors and a distinct gene mutational profile.	2022	03	10	Blood Adv	Fernández-Rodríguez	Concepción
34791836	10.1002/cam4.4422	Identification of a genetic signature enriching for response to ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma in the DAWN phase 2 trial.	The single-arm DAWN trial (NCT01779791) of ibrutinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 20.9% and a median response duration of 19.4 months. This biomarker analysis of the DAWN dataset sought to determine genetic classifiers for prediction of response to ibrutinib treatment. Whole exome sequencing was performed on baseline tumor samples. Potential germline variants were excluded; a custom set of 1216 cancer-related genes was examined. Responder- versus nonresponder-associated variants were identified using Fisher's exact test. Classifiers with increasing numbers of genes were created using a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selected genes, adding the most nonresponders to the existing ""predicted nonresponders"" set and were evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. Exome data were generated from 88 patient samples and 13,554 somatic mutation variants were inferred. Response data were available for 83 patients (17 responders, 66 nonresponders). Each sample showed 100 to &gt;500 mutated genes, with greater variance across nonresponders. The overall variant pattern was consistent with previous FL studies; 75 genes had mutations in &gt;10% of patients, including genes previously reported as associated with FL. Univariate analysis yielded responder-associated genes FANCA, HISTH1B, ANXA6, BTG1, and PARP10, highlighting the importance of functions outside of B-cell receptor signaling, including epigenetic processes, DNA damage repair, cell cycle/proliferation, and cell motility/invasiveness. While nonresponder-associated genes included well-known TP53 and CARD11, genetic classifiers developed using nonresponder-associated genes included ATP6AP1, EP400, ARID1A, SOCS1, and TBL1XR1, suggesting resistance to ibrutinib may be related to broad biological functions connected to epigenetic modification, telomere maintenance, and cancer-associated signaling pathways (mTOR, JAK/STAT, NF-κB). The results from univariate and genetic classifier analyses provide insights into genes associated with response or resistance to ibrutinib in FL and identify a classifier developed using nonresponder-associated genes, which warrants further investigation.

35038193	10.1111/his.14617	Incidence, clinicopathological features and genetics of in-situ follicular neoplasia: a comprehensive screening study in a Japanese cohort.	In-situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN) is a histologically recognizable neoplastic proliferation of follicular lymphoma (FL)-like B cells confined to the germinal centres. While some ISFNs are associated with overt FL, others are incidentally identified as isolated or pure forms in individuals without evidence of overt FL. The prevalence of incidentally found isolated ISFN is approximately 3% in Europe; however, no screening study has been conducted in Asia. To investigate the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of ISFNs in the Japanese population, we conducted histopathological screening of the lymph nodes (LNs) resected for solid tumours or inflammatory conditions. We screened for ISFN in 5700 LNs from 340 individuals using immunohistochemistry for BCL2 and identified seven ISFNs, with an incidence of 2.1%. The median age of the individuals with ISFN was 67 years, none of whom developed overt FL, with a median follow-up of 59 months. Next-generation sequencing was performed in five ISFNs, and 10 variants in seven FL-associated genes were identified. The identified variants included HIST1H1E (n = 2), ARID1A (n = 2), KMT2D (n = 1), CARD11 (n = 1), BCL7A (n = 1), CREBBP (n = 1) and TNFRSF14 (n = 1). The incidence of isolated ISFN in the Japanese population is not significantly different from that in Europe, presumably reflecting the recent increase in FL in Japan. These incidentally found ISFNs have a low potential to transform into overt FL. Although mutations of FL-associated genes are already present in ISFNs, further molecular studies are needed to identify driver genes leading to the transformation of ISFN to overt FL.	2022	03	30	Histopathology	Oishi	Naoki
35054466	10.3390/life12010073	The Pathologic and Genetic Characteristics of Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma.	Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a neoplasm of NK cells or cytotoxic T cells presenting in extranodal sites, most often in the nasal cavity. The typical immunophenotypes are cCD3+, sCD3-, CD4-, CD5-, CD8-, CD16-, and CD56+ with the expression of cytotoxic molecules. Tumor subsets express NK cell receptors, CD95/CD95L, CD30, MYC, and PDL1. Virtually all the tumor cells harbor the EBV genome, which plays a key role in lymphomagenesis as an epigenetic driver. EBV-encoded oncoproteins modulate the host-cell epigenetic machinery, reprogramming the viral and host epigenomes using host epigenetic modifiers. NGS analysis revealed the mutational landscape of ENKTL, predominantly involving the JAK-STAT pathway, epigenetic modifications, the RNA helicase family, the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, and tumor suppressors, which indicate an important role of these pathways and this group of genes in the lymphomagenesis of ENKTL. Recently, three molecular subtypes were proposed, the tumor-suppressor/immune-modulator (TSIM), MGA-BRDT (MB), and HDAC9-EP300-ARID1A (HEA) subtypes, and they are well-correlated with the cell of origin, EBV pattern, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes. A future investigation into the function and interaction of discovered genes would be very helpful for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of ENKTL and establishing better treatment strategies.	2022	01	28	Life (Basel)	Kim	Hyunsung
35172382	10.1002/JLB.5A0721-361R	Genomic heterogeneity contributed to different prognosis between adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic.	The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults is inferior to that in children. Hence, ALL remains challenging to cure in the adult population. Aberrant genetic alterations have been observed in ALL, although the patterns of differential gene alterations in adult and pediatric ALL have not been comprehensively determined on a genome-wide scale. We investigated the biologic differences in genomic profiles between adults (n = 64) and children (n = 54) with ALL and relationship between genomic heterogeneity and prognosis. The 2 populations showed similar common mutation types but an increased prevalence of genetic alterations in adult ALL. The median numbers of gene mutations were 17 (range: 1-53) and 4.5 (range: 1-19) per sample in adult and pediatric ALL, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). An increased number of gene mutations and age were significantly correlated (R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.5853, p &lt; 0.001). We identified 122 and 53 driver genes in adult and pediatric ALL samples, respectively. IKZF1, IDH1, and TTN mutations were significantly enriched in adult patients with ALL. KRAS, ARID1A, and CREBBP mutations were significantly enriched in pediatric patients with ALL (p &lt; 0.05). The incidence of relapse was 40.0% and 9.6% in adult and pediatric patients with ALL, respectively (p = 0.003). The overall survival and relapse-free survival of adult patients with ALL were poorer than those of pediatric patients with ALL (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). This genomic landscape enhances the understanding of the biologic differences in ALL between the 2 populations and provides insight for developing therapeutic approaches.	2022	08	26	J Leukoc Biol	Chen	Yanxin
35317330	10.14740/wjon1436	Non-GCB Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma With an Atypical Disease Course: A Case Report and Clinical Exome Analysis.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid tumor among other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (30-40% of all cases). This type of lymphoma is characterized by significant differences in treatment response and the heterogeneity of clinical traits. Approximately 60% of patients are cured using standard chemotherapy (CT), while in 10-15% of cases, the tumor is characterized by an extremely aggressive course and resistance to even the most high-dose programs with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is characterized by poor prognosis. Here, we describe a clinical case of diffuse ABC-DLBCL with an atypical disease course. Complete remission was achieved after four courses of CT, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). However, early relapse occurred 2 months after the completion of treatment. According to the results of cytogenetic studies, significant chromosome breakdowns were observed. Exome sequencing allowed for the detection of several novel mutations that affect components of the NOTCH2 and NF-κB signaling pathways, a number of epigenetic regulators (<i>KMT2D</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>MEF2B</i>), as well as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (<i>CD58</i> and <i>CD70</i>). Whether these mutations were the result of therapy or were originally present in the lymphoid tumor remains unclear. Nevertheless, the introduction of genomic technologies into clinical practice is important for making a diagnosis and developing a DLBCL treatment regimen with the use of targeted drugs.	2022	03	24	World J Oncol	Tsygankova	Svetlana
35454811	10.3390/cancers14081904	Deciphering Genetic Alterations of Hairy Cell Leukemia and Hairy Cell Leukemia-like Disorders in 98 Patients.	Hairy cell leukemia (cHCL) patients have, in most cases, a specific clinical and biological presentation with splenomegaly, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, monocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia, identification of hairy cells that express CD103, CD123, CD25, CD11c and identification of the V600E mutation in the B-Raf proto-oncogene (<i>BRAF</i>) in 90% of cases. Monocytopenia is absent in vHCL and SDRPL patients and the abnormal cells do not express CD25 or CD123 and do not present the <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation. Ten percent of cHCL patients are BRAF<sup>WT</sup> and the distinction between cHCL and HCL-like disorders including the variant form of HCL (vHCL) and splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) can be challenging. We performed deep sequencing in a large cohort of 84 cHCL and 16 HCL-like disorders to improve insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases. <i>BRAF</i> mutations were detected in 76/82 patients of cHCL (93%) and additional mutations were identified in Krüppel-like Factor 2 (<i>KLF2</i>) in 19 patients (23%) or <i>CDKN1B</i> in 6 patients (7.5%). Some <i>KLF2</i> genetic alterations were localized on the cytidine deaminase (AID) consensus motif, suggesting AID-induced mutations. When analyzing sequential samples, a clonal evolution was identified in half of the cHCL patients (6/12 pts). Among the 16 patients with HCL-like disorders, we observed an enrichment of <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations in vHCL/SDRPL (3/5 pts) and genes involved in the epigenetic regulation (<i>KDM6A, EZH2, CREBBP, ARID1A</i>) (3/5 pts). Furthermore, <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations were associated with a bad prognosis and a shorter time to next treatment (TTNT) and progression-free survival (PFS), independently of the HCL classification.	2022	07	16	Cancers (Basel)	Maitre	Elsa
35727053	10.1002/cncr.34348	Differential prognostic effect of systemic inflammation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy: A post hoc analysis of the phase 3 OAK trial.	A proinflammatory diathesis, as measured by the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), heralds an adverse disease course for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This post hoc analysis used data from the phase 3 OAK trial (NCT02008227), which randomized previously treated patients with NSCLC to atezolizumab or docetaxel. The main objective was assessing the differential impact of the pretreatment NLR on overall survival according to the treatment modality. In addition, patients' genomic characteristics were assessed according to their inflammatory status with a circulating free DNA (cfDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. In all, 600 and 575 patients with NLR data were included in the atezolizumab and docetaxel cohorts, respectively, with a median NLR of 4 (interquartile range, 2.6-6.7) for the pooled population. An NLR ≥4 was associated with a positive smoking status (88.6% vs. 78.1%; p &lt; .01), male sex (66.4% vs. 57.6%; p = .01), a worse performance status (71.3% vs. 55.2%; p &lt; .01), a higher number of metastatic sites (63.2% vs. 51.6%; p = .01), squamous histology (32.1% vs. 21.4%; p &lt; .01), and tissue KRAS mutations (30% vs. 18.7%; p = .02) but not with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression or the tissue epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status. A pretreatment NLR ≥4 was more strongly associated with mortality after atezolizumab (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.01) versus docetaxel (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.60; multivariable [MVA] interaction p = .08). The HR for an increased risk of death for PD-L1-negative/NLR ≥4 patients (compared with PD-L1-positive/NLR &lt;4 patients) was significantly higher in the atezolizumab cohort (MVA interaction p = .01). The exclusion of EGFR/ALK-positive patients further increased the prognostic ability of the baseline NLR in favor of atezolizumab (MVA interaction p = .02). Pretreatment cfDNA data from NGS showed that patients with a high blood tumor mutation burden (cutoff, 16 mut/Mb) had a higher median NLR (4.6 vs. 3.7; p = .01). After adjustments for multiple comparisons, none of the selected variants of interest (EGFR, KRAS, TP53, KEAP1, STK11, SMARCA4, ARID1A, and targeted DNA damage response and repair genes) were significantly associated with the NLR. A low baseline NLR identified patients with NSCLC who derived a greater survival benefit from atezolizumab in comparison with those identified in the docetaxel cohort. The NLR could complement PD-L1 expression in tailoring treatment in this setting.	2022	08	08	Cancer	Cortellini	Alessio
35794096	10.1038/s41467-022-31355-8	Clinical relevance of molecular characteristics in Burkitt lymphoma differs according to age.	While survival has improved for Burkitt lymphoma patients, potential differences in outcome between pediatric and adult patients remain unclear. In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25 ± 4% versus 6 ± 2%, p-value 0.0002). This identifies a promising molecular marker for relapse incidence in pediatric BL which will be used in future clinical trials.	2022	07	08	Nat Commun	Burkhardt	Birgit
35879731	10.1186/s40364-022-00401-4	Dynamic change of soluble interleukin-2 receptor distinguished molecular heterogeneity and microenvironment alterations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma with variable clinical outcomes and prediction of prognosis remains important for long-term remission. We performed serial serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) measurement pretreatment and before each cycle of the treatment in 599 patients with de novo DLBCL. Genomic and transcriptomic features were analyzed by 223 DNA- and 227 RNA-sequencing, respectively. Applying the cut-off value to sIL-2R pretreatment and cycle 2 (C2) level, patients were classified into FINE subtype (pretreatment low level) with good prognosis, RES subtype (pretreatment high level and C2 low level) with intermediate prognosis, and RET subtype (pretreatment high level and C2 high level) with poor prognosis, independent of International Prognostic Index. In ""others"" genetic subtype, dynamic change of sIL-2R showed prognostic significance and genetic features. Compared with FINE subtype, RES subtype had increased ARID1A and MYD88 mutations, and RET subtype had increased KMT2D, LYN and SOCS1 mutations. RES and RET subtypes showed significant enrichment in oncogenic pathways, such as ERK, NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and immune-associated pathways. As for tumor microenvironment, RES subtype exhibited increased recruiting activity of CD8 + T, T helper 1, and natural killer cells, and RET subtype with increased recruiting activity of CD4 + T and regulatory T cells in silico. There was a positive correlation between transcripts of IL-2R and immune checkpoint expressions including PD-1 and CTLA-4. Our findings identified that dynamic change of sIL-2R, with this simple and easy detection method in peripheral blood, had long-term prognostic effect and specific relation to microenvironment alterations in DLBCL.	2022	07	29	Biomark Res	Huo	Yu-Jia
36001451	10.1097/PAS.0000000000001956	Targeted Mutational Profiling Reveals Clonal Relationships in Metachronous Occurrence of Classic Hodgkin and Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphomas.	Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) patients may infrequently present with a prior or recurrent disease with discordant histology resembling non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These include primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or mediastinal gray-zone lymphoma (MGZL). Such patients are often refractory to standard therapy and their diagnosis is hampered by significant morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap and insufficient molecular data. Among 509 CHL patients seen at an academic medical center, 6 patients had a prior or subsequent diagnosis different from CHL. Paired tissue samples were evaluated by targeted mutational analysis using a 164-gene panel. Our findings show multiple shared variants indicative of a clonal relationship between the CHL and the PMBL, DLBCL, or MGZL diagnoses. Most frequent mutated genes included TNFAIP3 (4 of 6, 66.7%), STAT6 (3 or 6, 50%), ARID1A (3 of 6, 50%), and XPO1 (3 of 5, 60%). Three patients showed the same oncogenic variant within the XPO1 gene (E571K), and mutations in TNFAIP3 and B2M were observed in 2 of the 5 patients with shared variants. In addition, differences in the mutation profile between the lymphoma pairs were also observed, which could represent clonal evolution. Mutational profiling could be of benefit in patients with recurrent/refractory disease with discordant histology, where the clonal relationship could be helpful to inform and guide therapeutic decisions. These findings provide further evidence of a true biological continuum surrounding CHL, PMBL, DLBCL, and MGZL and shed light on underlying genetic events and their clinical impact.	2022	08	24	Am J Surg Pathol	Singh	Kunwar
33431788	10.1038/s41392-020-00437-8	CREBBP/EP300 mutations promoted tumor progression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through altering tumor-associated macrophage polarization via FBXW7-NOTCH-CCL2/CSF1 axis.	Epigenetic alterations play an important role in tumor progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the biological relevance of epigenetic gene mutations on tumor microenvironment remains to be determined. The core set of genes relating to histone methylation (KMT2D, KMT2C, EZH2), histone acetylation (CREBBP, EP300), DNA methylation (TET2), and chromatin remodeling (ARID1A) were detected in the training cohort of 316 patients by whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) and in the validation cohort of 303 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL by targeted sequencing. Their correlation with peripheral blood immune cells and clinical outcomes were assessed. Underlying mechanisms on tumor microenvironment were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Among all 619 DLBCL patients, somatic mutations in KMT2D (19.5%) were most frequently observed, followed by mutations in ARID1A (8.7%), CREBBP (8.4%), KMT2C (8.2%), TET2 (7.8%), EP300 (6.8%), and EZH2 (2.9%). Among them, CREBBP/EP300 mutations were significantly associated with decreased peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios, as well as inferior progression-free and overall survival. In B-lymphoma cells, the mutation or knockdown of CREBBP or EP300 inhibited H3K27 acetylation, downregulated FBXW7 expression, activated the NOTCH pathway, and downstream CCL2/CSF1 expression, resulting in tumor-associated macrophage polarization to M2 phenotype and tumor cell proliferation. In B-lymphoma murine models, xenografted tumors bearing CREBBP/EP300 mutation presented lower H3K27 acetylation, higher M2 macrophage recruitment, and more rapid tumor growth than those with CREBBP/EP300 wild-type control via FBXW7-NOTCH-CCL2/CSF1 axis. Our work thus contributed to the understanding of aberrant histone acetylation regulation on tumor microenvironment as an alternative mechanism of tumor progression in DLBCL.	2022	03	04	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Huang	Yao-Hui
33829512	10.1111/his.14378	Bcl-2-negative IGH-BCL2 translocation-negative follicular lymphoma of the thyroid differs genetically and epigenetically from Bcl-2-positive IGH-BCL2 translocation-positive follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL), comprising a minor subset of primary thyroid lymphomas, is divided into two groups based on Bcl-2 expression and IGH-BCL2 translocation. The clinicopathological features exhibited by Bcl-2-negative IGH-BCL2 translocation-negative FL of the thyroid (Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL) are different from those of conventional FL; however, its lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we collected samples from seven patients with Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL to investigate their epigenetic and genetic aberrations. The immunohistochemical profiles of epigenetic modifiers and the methylation status of histones were examined, including EZH2, MLL2/KMT2D, CBP/CREBBP, EP300, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFL and Bcl-2-positive IGH-BCL2 translocation-positive FL of the thyroid (Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFL). Most Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs retained the positivity of epigenetic modifiers and lower expression of H3K27me3, although Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs exhibited aberrant immunohistochemical patterns of EZH2 and CBP/CREBBP and overexpression of H3K27me3. Samples from seven cases were further analysed using targeted sequencing, focusing on the exons of 409 key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs do not have pathogenic mutations of epigenetic modifiers, such as EZH2, MLL2/KMT2D, MLL3/KMT2C, EP300 and ARID1A, which have been reported in FLs in the literature, whereas Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs are probably pathogenic/pathogenic missense mutations or frameshift mutations of these genes. Additionally, novel mutations in TET2 and EP400 were detected in Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs. Different genetic and epigenetic abnormalities might be involved in the oncogenesis of Bcl-2<sup>-</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>-</sup> tFLs from Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> /IGH-BCL2<sup>+</sup> tFLs and other FLs.	2022	01	28	Histopathology	Hamamoto	Yuichiro
34039950	10.1038/s41408-021-00493-5	Genomic insights into the pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by whole-genome and targeted amplicon sequencing.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS) constitute a distinct clinicopathological entity in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. However, its genomic features remain sparsely characterized. Here, we combine whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted amplicon sequencing (tNGS), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) from 47 EBV + DLBCL (NOS) cases to delineate the genomic landscape of this rare disease. Integrated WGS and tNGS analysis clearly distinguished this tumor type from EBV-negative DLBCL due to frequent mutations in ARID1A (45%), KMT2A/KMT2D (32/30%), ANKRD11 (32%), or NOTCH2 (32%). WGS uncovered structural aberrations including 6q deletions (5/8 patients), which were subsequently validated by FISH (14/32 cases). Expanding on previous reports, we identified recurrent alterations in CCR6 (15%), DAPK1 (15%), TNFRSF21 (13%), CCR7 (11%), and YY1 (6%). Lastly, functional annotation of the mutational landscape by sequential gene set enrichment and network propagation predicted an effect on the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway (CSNK2A2, CARD10), IL6/JAK/STAT (SOCS1/3, STAT3), and WNT signaling (FRAT1, SFRP5) alongside aberrations in immunological processes, such as interferon response. This first comprehensive description of EBV + DLBCL (NOS) tumors substantiates the evidence of its pathobiological independence and helps stratify the molecular taxonomy of aggressive lymphomas in the effort for future therapeutic strategies.	2022	01	10	Blood Cancer J	Gebauer	Niklas
34070951	10.3390/diagnostics11060999	Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Cholangiocarcinoma.	The analysis of cfDNA has been applied as a liquid biopsy in several malignancies. However, its value in the diagnosis and prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have not been well defined. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic values of cfDNA level and tumor-specific mutation in circulating DNA (ctDNA) in CCA. The plasma cfDNA levels from 62 CCA patients, 33 benign biliary disease (BBD) patients and 30 normal controls were quantified by fluorescent assay. Targeted probe-based sequencing of 60 genes was applied for mutation profiling in 10 ctDNA samples and their corresponding treatment-naïve tissues. cfDNA levels in CCA were significantly higher than those in BBD and normal controls. We found that cfDNA levels at 0.2175 and 0.3388 ng/µL significantly discriminated CCA from healthy controls and BBD with 88.7 and 82.3% sensitivity and 96.7 and 57.6% specificity, respectively. cfDNA levels showed superior diagnostic efficacy in detecting CCA compared to CEA and CA19-9. <i>ARID1A</i> (30%), <i>PBRM1</i> (30%), <i>MTOR</i> (30%), and <i>FGFR3</i> (30%) mutations were the most common. Using nine frequently mutated genes in the ctDNA samples, the diagnostic accuracy of cfDNA sequencing was 90.8%, with 96.7% average sensitivity and 72.4% specificity. This study supports the use of cfDNA as a diagnosis and prognostic biomarker for CCA.	2021	06	27	Diagnostics (Basel)	Wintachai	Preawwalee
34348985	10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207441	Clinicopathological characteristics and genetic variations of uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours.	To investigate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours (UTROSCTs) and the value of molecular diversity in the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Five patients with UTROSCT were enrolled, and their clinical data, pathological morphologies, immunophenotypes and molecular features were analysed. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation for <i>NCOA1</i>, <i>NCOA2</i>, <i>NCOA3</i>, <i>JAZF1</i> and <i>PHF1</i> and next-generation sequencing for 27 homologous recombination/repair (HRR) pathway genes were performed on five and three UTROSCT specimens, respectively. All five patients were treated for abnormal uterine bleeding and grossly presented with intrauterine polyps. Under a microscope, tumour cells grew diffusely and presented a cordlike arrangement and glandular duct-like structures, with nuclei ranging from round to oval, vesicular chromatin and visible nucleoli in some cases. The mitotic count was less than 3/10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry showed sex cord, epithelial cell and smooth muscle cell biomarkers and diffuse, strong staining for B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2). <i>NCOA1</i> and <i>NCOA3</i> rearrangements were identified in 80% (4/5) of the cases. <i>JAZF1</i> and <i>PHF1</i> rearrangements were not detected in any of five patients. HRR pathway gene mutations were detected in all three patients, including <i>FANCE</i>, <i>ATR</i> and <i>ARID1A</i> mutations in one case each. UTROSCT is a rare mesenchymal tumour, and biopsy specimens are easily misdiagnosed. UTROSCT diagnosis requires the combined use of biomarkers and molecular detection. BCL-2 has potential diagnostic value as a marker. UTROSCT can have mutations related to the HRR pathway, suggesting that this tumour type may be sensitive to platinum/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.	2021	08	05	J Clin Pathol	Ye	Shan
31423576	10.1111/bjh.16159	M7-FLIPI is not prognostic in follicular lymphoma patients with first-line rituximab chemo-free therapy.	The clinical course of follicular lymphoma (FL) is highly variable. Recently the m7-FL international prognostic index (FLIPI) integrating performance status, FLIPI score and the mutational status of seven genes, was shown to stratify patients into ""low-risk"" and ""high-risk"" with respect to 5-year failure-free survival after first-line immunochemotherapy. Our aim was to evaluate the model after rituximab without chemotherapy. The Nordic Lymphoma Group performed two randomized clinical trials on indolent lymphoma patients receiving single rituximab and rituximab with interferon-α2a. In total, 95 FL patients had sufficient fresh-frozen diagnostic material for sequencing. A targeted panel for the genes EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP and CARD11 was utilized for m7-FLIPI score calculation. With a median follow-up of 10·6 years, 76% of patients were alive. No difference in time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as the interval between start of trial therapy and initiation of new therapy or death, nor overall survival (OS) was found between the m7-FLIPI risk groups (log-rank P = 0·94 and 0·99, respectively). EZH2 mutations were associated with longer TTF (log-rank P = 0·04) and in EP300 mutations were associated with shorter TTF (log-rank P = 0·01). We conclude that the prognostic value of the m7-FLIPI clinicogenetic model seems dependent on therapeutic regimen.	2020	08	05	Br J Haematol	Lockmer	Sandra
32083995	10.1200/JCO.19.02314	Genomic Landscape of Waldenström Macroglobulinemia and Its Impact on Treatment Strategies.	Next-generation sequencing has revealed recurring somatic mutations in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), including <i>MYD88</i> (95%-97%), <i>CXCR4</i> (30%-40%), <i>ARID1A</i> (17%), and <i>CD79B</i> (8%-15%). Deletions involving chromosome 6q are common in patients with mutated <i>MYD88</i> and include genes that modulate NFKB, BCL2, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), and apoptosis. Patients with wild-type <i>MYD88</i> WM show an increased risk of transformation and death and exhibit many mutations found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The discovery of <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> mutations in WM has facilitated rational drug development, including the development of BTK and CXCR4 inhibitors. Responses to many agents commonly used to treat WM, including the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, are affected by <i>MYD88</i> and/or <i>CXCR4</i> mutation status. The mutation status of both <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> can be used for a precision-guided treatment approach to WM.	2020	12	23	J Clin Oncol	Treon	Steven P

A 4-year-old female child developed cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis 6 months following a diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imaging revealed no evidence of systemic disease. Seven months later, the first systemic lesion was discovered on laryngoscopy. Restaging Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography at that time revealed new 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positive lesions in the left apical pleural margin, right lower peri-esophageal region, left ventricular myocardium, pancreas, upper pole of the left kidney, and inguinal and gluteal regions consistent with progressive systemic disease. Genomic testing revealed a low tumor mutational burden as well as mutations in KRAS G12A, ARID1A Q524, CDKN2A/B loss, and an alteration in NOTCH1.	2021	01	25	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Jansen	Chandler
32978169	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2147	EZH2-Targeted Therapies in Cancer: Hype or a Reality.	Next-generation genomic sequencing has identified multiple novel molecular alterations in cancer. Since the identification of DNA methylation and histone modification, it has become evident that genes encoding epigenetic modifiers that locally and globally regulate gene expression play a crucial role in normal development and cancer progression. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the enzymatic catalytic subunit of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that can alter gene expression by trimethylating lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27). EZH2 is involved in global transcriptional repression, mainly targeting tumor-suppressor genes. EZH2 is commonly overexpressed in cancer and shows activating mutations in subtypes of lymphoma. Extensive studies have uncovered an important role for EZH2 in cancer progression and have suggested that it may be a useful therapeutic target. In addition, tumors harboring mutations in other epigenetic genes such as <i>ARID1A, KDM6</i>, and <i>BAP1</i> are highly sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, thus increasing its potential as a therapeutic target. Recent studies also suggest that inhibition of EZH2 enhances the response to tumor immunotherapy. Many small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target EZH2 or the PRC2 complex, with some of these inhibitors now in early clinical trials reporting clinical responses with acceptable tolerability. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in targeting EZH2, its successes, and potential limitations, and we discuss the future directions of this therapeutic subclass.	2021	03	29	Cancer Res	Eich	Marie-Lisa
33252851	10.1002/ctm2.221	Influence of oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations on extranodal invasion in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive subtype of lymphoma, and multiple extranodal involvement (ENI) indicates adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations on ENI in DLBCL. The clinical features of 1960 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL were analyzed, and DNA and RNA sequencing was performed on 670 and 349 patients, respectively. Oncogenic mutations and tumor microenvironment alterations were compared according to ENI and evaluated in zebrafish patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Multiple ENI was significantly associated with poor performance status, advanced stage, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, low response rate, and inferior prognosis. Lymphoma invasion of the bones, spleen, bone marrow, liver, and central nervous system were independent unfavorable prognostic factors. MYD88 was frequently mutated in patients with multiple ENI, co-occurred with mutations in CD79B, PIM1, TBL1XR1, BTG1, MPEG1, and PRDM1, and correlated with invasion of the bones, kidney/adrenal glands, breasts, testes, skin, and uterus/ovaries. For tumor microenvironment alterations, patients with multiple ENI showed higher regulatory T-cell (Treg)-recruiting activity, but lower extracellular matrix-encoding gene expression, than those without ENI and with single ENI. Elevated Treg-recruiting activity was related to mutations in B2M, SGK1, FOXO1, HIST1H1E, and ARID1A, and correlated with invasion of the bone marrow and thyroid. Additionally, mutations in MYD88, PIM1, TBL1XR1, SGK1, FOXO1, HIST1H1E, and ARID1A were associated with decreased major histocompatibility complex class I expression. Zebrafish models further revealed relationships between MYD88 mutations and invasion of the kidneys and gonads, as well as B2M mutations and invasion of the bone marrow. Increased CXCR4 expression is linked to bone marrow invasion in an organotropic way. Our findings thus contribute to an improved understanding of the biological behavior of multiple ENI and provide a clinical rationale for targeting ENI in DLBCL.	2020	12	07	Clin Transl Med	Shen	Rong
33376237	10.1038/s41392-020-00331-3	Combination of anti-PD-1 antibody with P-GEMOX as a potentially effective immunochemotherapy for advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma.	Advanced natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTL) has demonstrated poor prognosis with currently available therapies. Here, we report the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody with the P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) regimen in advanced NKTL. Nine patients underwent six 21-day cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody (day 1), pegaspargase 2000 U/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1 and 8) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), followed by anti-PD-1 antibody maintenance every 3 weeks. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and genetic alterations were determined in paraffin-embedded pretreatment tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Responses were assessed using <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG-PET) and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients exhibited significant responses, comprising of seven complete remissions and one partial remission (overall response rate: 88.9%). After a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 6/9 patients (66.7%) remained in complete remission. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (33.3%), neutropenia (33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (33.3%); all of which were manageable and resolved. Immunochemotherapy produced a high response rate in patients with positive PD-L1 expression (5/6, 83.3%). NGS analysis suggested that STAT3/JAK3/PD-L1 alterations and ARID1A mutation were associated with immunochemotherapy efficacy. Mutation in DDX3X and alteration in epigenetic modifiers of KMT2D, TET2, and BCORL1 might indicate a poor response to immunochemotherapy. In conclusion, the anti-PD-1 antibody plus P-GEMOX regimen demonstrated promising efficacy in advanced NKTL. PD-L1 expression combined with specific genetic alterations could be used as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses to immunochemotherapy.	2021	10	13	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Cai	Jun
30886885	10.1016/j.gore.2019.02.007	Endometrial cancer arising after complete remission of uterine malignant lymphoma: A case report and mutation analysis.	Uterine malignant lymphoma is rare and its association with secondary cancer has not been fully described. Here, we report a rare case of endometrial cancer arising after 1 year of complete remission of uterine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). An 88-year-old woman was referred to us for abnormal genital bleeding and was diagnosed with uterine DLBCL. She underwent chemotherapy comprising rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone followed by radiation therapy; subsequently, she achieved complete remission. One year later, she noticed genital bleeding recurrence, and endometrial biopsy revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma. Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Her pathological diagnosis was endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, grade 1 (pT1aN0). Adenocarcinoma was observed over foamy macrophages aggregates, indicating remission of DLBCL. Targeted sequencing of both DLBCL and endometrial cancer revealed 24 gene mutations including the truncation-type mutations of <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>PTEN</i> occurring only in endometrial cancer. These multiple somatic gene mutations accumulating within 1 year imply endometrial carcinogenesis induced by DNA damages caused by treatment for DLBCL. Although the epidemiological risk of secondary malignancies after uterine lymphoma remains unclear, the present case serves as a warning for secondary cancer and highlights the importance of early detection and treatment.	2020	10	01	Gynecol Oncol Rep	Kuno	Ikumi
31123138	10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205727	Intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma: clinicopathological and integrated molecular analysis of two cases provides a clue to disease pathogenesis.	To elucidate the clinicopathological and molecular features of intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma (IVNKTCL). Two cases of IVNKTCL were retrieved from a single-centre cohort composed of 25 intravascular lymphomas. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry were performed. We identified somatic mutations in the following epigenetic regulators: four histone genes (<i>HIST1H2AN</i>, <i>HIST1H2BE</i>, <i>HIST1H2BN</i> and <i>H3F3A),</i> histone deacetylase (<i>HDAC5</i>), two helicases (<i>WRN</i> and <i>DDX3X</i>), two methylation-related enzymes (<i>TET2</i> and <i>DNMT1</i>) and the SNI/SWF pathway (<i>ARID1A</i>). Copy number analysis identified driver gene alterations comprising the loss of <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>HACE1</i> and <i>SMAD4</i>, and the gain of <i>SOX2</i> and histone clusters. RNA sequencing analysis did not indicate the presence of any fusion gene. Both cases were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and showed strong expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This study raises the possibility that, at least for some patients, IVNKTCL may be considered an epigenetic disease with EBV infection-associated aetiopathogenesis.	2019	09	03	J Clin Pathol	Fujikura	Kohei
31300419	10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029546	Sporadic and endemic Burkitt lymphoma have frequent <i>FOXO1</i> mutations but distinct hotspots in the AKT recognition motif.	FOXO1 has an oncogenic role in adult germinal center-derived lymphomas, in which mutations, predominately within the AKT recognition motif, cause nuclear retention of FOXO1, resulting in increased cell proliferation. To determine the prevalence and distribution of <i>FOXO1</i> mutations in pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL), we sequenced a large number of sporadic and endemic BL patient samples. We report a high frequency of <i>FOXO1</i> mutations in both sporadic and endemic BL at diagnosis, occurring in 23/78 (29%) and 48/89 (54%) samples, respectively, as well as 8/16 (50%) cases at relapse. Mutations of T24 were the most common in sporadic BL but were rare in endemic cases, in which mutations of residue S22, also within the AKT recognition motif, were the most frequent. <i>FOXO1</i> mutations were almost always present in the major tumor cell clone but were not associated with outcome. Analysis of other recurrent mutations reported in BL revealed that <i>FOXO1</i> mutations were associated with mutations of <i>DDX3X</i> and <i>ARID1A,</i> but not <i>MYC</i>, <i>TCF3</i>/<i>ID3,</i> or members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. We further show common nuclear retention of the FOXO1 protein, irrespective of mutation status, suggesting alternative unknown mechanisms for maintaining FOXO1 transcriptional activity in BL. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of <i>FOXO1</i> in an endemic cell line produced a significant decrease in cell proliferation, supporting an oncogenic role for <i>FOXO1</i> in endemic BL. Thus, <i>FOXO1</i> is frequently mutated in both sporadic and endemic BL and may offer a potential therapeutic target for pediatric BL patients worldwide.	2020	07	07	Blood Adv	Zhou	Peixun
31747604	10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.083	Targeting Excessive EZH1 and EZH2 Activities for Abnormal Histone Methylation and Transcription Network in Malignant Lymphomas.	Although global H3K27me3 reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, no effective therapeutic strategy for H3K27me3-high malignancies harboring EZH2<sup>WT/WT</sup> has yet been established. We explore epigenome and transcriptome in EZH2<sup>WT/WT</sup> and EZH2<sup>WT/Mu</sup> aggressive lymphomas and show that mutual interference and compensatory function of co-expressed EZH1 and EZH2 rearrange their own genome-wide distribution, thereby establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Direct comparison of leading compounds introduces potency and a mechanism of action of the EZH1/2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat). The synthetic lethality is observed in all lymphoma models and primary adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells. Opposing actions of EZH1/2-polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes are required for facultative heterochromatin formation. Inactivation of chromatin-associated genes (ARID1A, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCB1/SNF5, KDM6A/UTX, BAP1, KMT2D/MLL2) and oncovirus infection (HTLV-1, EBV) trigger EZH1/2 perturbation and H3K27me3 deposition. Our study provides the mechanism-based rationale for chemical dual targeting of EZH1/2 in cancer epigenome.	2020	09	21	Cell Rep	Yamagishi	Makoto
29307627	10.1016/j.humpath.2017.12.025	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma composed predominantly of rhabdoid/epithelioid cells: a frequently misdiagnosed highly aggressive variant.	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is one of the most common sarcoma types in adults with a predilection for the retroperitoneum. We have recently encountered 6 cases of DDL composed predominantly of rounded, rhabdoid or epithelioid cells mimicking rhabdoid melanoma, epithelioid rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients were 5 males and one female aged 64 to 81 years (median, 68). Tumors originated in the retroperitoneum (n=5; 3 in the psoas muscle) and deep soft tissue of the thigh (n=1). All 3 patients with follow-up died of metastatic disease within 4 to 8 months. Preoperative biopsy diagnoses never suggested dedifferentiated liposarcoma as a possibility; instead carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma were on top of suggestions. Five resected tumors were composed predominantly (70%-100%) of anaplastic rounded to oval rhabdoid cells with prominent central nucleoli and paranuclear rhabdoid inclusions. Bi- and multinucleation was a constant feature. The background stroma showed variable myxoid changes and minor mixed inflammatory cells. Two cases showed homologous dedifferentiation and another had sclerosing spindle cell nodule but a well-differentiated lipomatous component was not seen in any. One biopsied case showed solely monotonous small round blue cells with scattered rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of MDM2 (6/6), CDK4 (5/6), pancytokeratin AE/1AE3 (4/6) and diffusely desmin and myogenin (2/6). All cases showed high-level co-amplification of MDM2/CDK4 by in situ hybridization. The SWI/SNF complex components (SMARCB1, SMARCA2, SMARCA4, ARID1A and PBRM1) were intact in all cases. This highly aggressive liposarcoma variant needs to be distinguished from a variety of neoplasms including undifferentiated carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and others.	2019	04	09	Hum Pathol	Agaimy	Abbas
29486633	10.1177/1533034618754475	Loss of ARID1A Expression Correlates With Tumor Differentiation and Tumor Progression Stage in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.	Mutations in the AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene, which encodes a subunit of the Switch/Sucrose nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, can result in loss of protein expression and are associated with different cancers. Here, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the significance of AT-rich interactive domain 1A loss in 73 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases with paired paracancerous normal pancreatic tissues. The relationship between levels of the AT-rich interactive domain 1A protein product, BAF250a, and clinicopathological parameters in the 73 pancreatic cancer specimens was also analyzed. We found that the expression of AT-rich interactive domain 1A in normal pancreatic tissue was higher than that in tumor tissue. Loss of AT-rich interactive domain 1A expression in pancreatic tumors was associated with tumor differentiation ( P = .002) and tumor stage ( P = .048). Meanwhile, BAF250a protein levels were not related to lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, sex, or age and were not associated with survival. Transfection of the pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1 and PANC-1 with small-interfering RNA specific for AT-rich interactive domain 1A resulted in elevated messenger RNA and protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), CyclinD1, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS). The AT-rich interactive domain 1A expression level in the cells was increased following microRNA-31 (miR-31) inhibitor transfection. Our data provide additional evidence that AT-rich interactive domain 1A might function as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic carcinogenesis.	2019	04	01	Technol Cancer Res Treat	Zhang	Li
29669287	10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.078	ZRANB1 Is an EZH2 Deubiquitinase and a Potential Therapeutic Target in Breast Cancer.	Although EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors have shown antitumor effects in EZH2-mutated lymphoma and ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, many cancers do not respond because EZH2 can promote cancer independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. Here we identify ZRANB1 as the EZH2 deubiquitinase. ZRANB1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes EZH2. Depletion of ZRANB1 in breast cancer cells results in EZH2 destabilization and growth inhibition. Systemic delivery of ZRANB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to marked antitumor and antimetastatic effects in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Intriguingly, a small-molecule inhibitor of ZRANB1 destabilizes EZH2 and inhibits the viability of TNBC cells. In patients with breast cancer, ZRANB1 levels correlate with EZH2 levels and poor survival. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential for targeting the EZH2 deubiquitinase ZRANB1.	2019	09	17	Cell Rep	Zhang	Peijing
29989027	10.18632/oncotarget.25601	New generation sequencing of targeted genes in the classical and the variant form of hairy cell leukemia highlights mutations in epigenetic regulation genes.	Classical hairy cell leukemia (HCL-c) is a rare lymphoid neoplasm. <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation, detected in more than 80% of the cases, is described as a driver mutation, but additional genetic abnormalities appear to be necessary for the disease progression. For cases of HCL-c harboring a wild-type <i>BRAF</i> gene, the differential diagnosis of the variant form of HCL (HCL-v) or splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) is complex. We selected a panel of 21 relevant genes based on a literature review of whole exome sequencing studies (<i>BRAF</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, <i>DUSP2</i>, <i>MAPK15</i>, <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>EZH2</i>, <i>KDM6A</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>CDKN1B</i>, <i>XPO1</i>, <i>KLF2</i>, <i>CXCR4</i>, <i>NOTH1</i>, <i>NOTCH2</i>, <i>MYD88</i>, <i>ANXA1</i>, <i>U2AF1</i>, <i>BCOR</i>, and <i>ABCA8</i>). We analyzed 20 HCL-c and 4 HCL-v patients. The analysis of diagnostic samples mutations in <i>BRAF</i> (<i>n</i> = 18), <i>KLF2</i> (<i>n</i> = 4), <i>MAP2K1</i> (<i>n</i> = 3), <i>KDM6A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CDKN1B</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>ARID1A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CREBBP</i> (<i>n</i> = 2) <i>NOTCH1</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) and <i>ARID1B</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> was found in 90% (18/20) of HCL-c patients. In HCL-c patients with <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> , other mutations were found in 33% (6/18) of cases. All 4 HCL-v patients had mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes: <i>KDM6A</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>CREBBP</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) or <i>ARID1A</i> (<i>n</i> = 1). The analysis of sequential samples (at diagnosis and relapse) from 5 patients (2 HCL-c and 3 HCL-v), showed the presence of 2 new subclonal mutations (<i>BCOR<sup>E1430X</sup></i> and <i>XPO1<sup>E571K</sup></i> ) in one patient and variations of the mutated allele frequency in 2 other cases. In the HCL-v disease, we described new mutations targeting <i>KDM6A</i> that encode a lysine demethylase protein. This opens new perspectives for personalized medicine for this group of patients.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Maitre	Elsa
30134235	10.1159/000492835	Frequent Mutations in Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma.	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL-NT or NKTCL), with its aggressive nature and poor prognosis, has been widely studied to discover more effective treatment options. Various somatic gene alterations have been identified by traditional Sanger sequencing. However, recently, novel gene mutations in NKTCL have been revealed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, suggesting the potential for novel targeted therapies. This review discusses recurrent aberrations in NKTCL detected by NGS, which can be categorized into three main groups, specifically, tumor suppressors (TP53, DDX3X, and MGA), the JAK/STAT cascade, and epigenetic modifiers (KMT2D, BCOR, ARID1A, and EP300). Some epigenetic dysregulation and DDX3X mutation, which have been rarely identified by traditional sequencing technology, were recently uncovered with high frequencies by NGS. In this review, we summarize the mutational frequencies of various genes in NKTCL. In general, based on our analysis, BCOR is the most frequently mutated gene (16.9%), followed by TP53 (14.7%), and DDX3X (13.6%). The characterization of such genes provides new insight into the pathogenesis of this disease and indicates new biomarkers or therapeutic targets.	2018	09	18	Cell Physiol Biochem	Zhang	Yanjie

27872090	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1303	Mutational Landscape of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Current standard of care for patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is mainly effective, with high remission rates after treatment. However, the genetic perturbations that give rise to this disease remain largely undefined, limiting the ability to address resistant tumors or develop less toxic targeted therapies. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to interrogate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of 240 pediatric ALL cases with their matched remission samples. Commonly mutated genes fell into several categories, including RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors involved in lineage commitment, and the p53/cell-cycle pathway. Unique recurrent mutational hotspots were observed in epigenetic regulators CREBBP (R1446C/H), WHSC1 (E1099K), and the tyrosine kinase FLT3 (K663R, N676K). The mutant WHSC1 was established as a gain-of-function oncogene, while the epigenetic regulator ARID1A and transcription factor CTCF were functionally identified as potential tumor suppressors. Analysis of 28 diagnosis/relapse trio patients plus 10 relapse cases revealed four evolutionary paths and uncovered the ordering of acquisition of mutations in these patients. This study provides a detailed mutational portrait of pediatric ALL and gives insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.

28401006		Genomic and proteomic characterization of ARID1A chromatin remodeller in ampullary tumors.	<i>AT rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A)</i> is one of the most commonly mutated genes in a broad variety of tumors. The mechanisms that involve <i>ARID1A</i> in ampullary cancer progression remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the frequency of <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>KRAS</i> mutations in ampullary adenomas and adenocarcinomas and in duodenal adenocarcinomas from two cohorts of patients from Singapore and Romania, correlated with clinical and pathological tumor features, and assessed the functional role of <i>ARID1A</i>. In the ampullary adenocarcinomas, the frequency of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>ARID1A</i> mutations was 34.7% and 8.2% respectively, with a loss or reduction of ARID1A protein in 17.2% of the cases. <i>ARID1A</i> mutational status was significantly correlated with ARID1A protein expression level (P=0.023). There was a significant difference in frequency of <i>ARID1A</i> mutation between Romania and Singapore (2.7% versus 25%, P=0.04), suggestive of different etiologies. One somatic mutation was detected in the ampullary adenoma group. <i>In vitro</i> studies indicated the tumor suppressive role of <i>ARID1A</i>. Our results warrant further investigation of this chromatin remodeller as a potential early biomarker of the disease, as well as identification of therapeutic targets in <i>ARID1A</i> mutated ampullary cancers.	2020	09	30	Am J Cancer Res	Nastase	Anca
29025291	10.1556/650.2017.30868	[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and its individualized therapy options].	Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia is a form of lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma that preferentially localizes to the bone marrow and causes a special syndrome characterized by monoclonal IgM hypersecretion. Recent results point to the fact that this disease has at least three different pathobiological forms with different clinical presentation. While mutations of MYD88 occur in 95-97% of the cases, there are CXCR4 mutations in 30-40%, ARID1A mutations in 17% and CD79B mutations in approximately 10% of afflicted individuals. CXCR pathway signaling is able to transcriptionally silence tumor suppressors induced by MYD88 activation. Patients with mutated MYD88 and CXCR4 present with higher tumor burden, slower developing and less deep response upon therapy with more frequent resistance. In this review, based on the most recent data, a treatment selection advice is provided for the therapy of symptomatic patients.

29222279	10.1182/asheducation-2017.1.358	Follicular lymphoma: are we ready for a risk-adapted approach?	Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western hemisphere. The natural history of FL appears to have been favorably impacted by the introduction of rituximab after randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy induction has improved the overall survival. Yet, the disease is biologically and clinically heterogeneous with wide variations in outcomes for individual patients. The ability to accurately risk-stratify patients and then tailor therapy to the individual is an area of ongoing research. Historically, tumor grade, tumor burden, and the FL international prognostic index (version 1 and version 2) have been used to distinguish low-risk from high-risk patients. Biologic factors such as mutations in key genes can identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes to first-line therapy (mutational status of 7 genes [EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOX01, CREBBP, and CARD11] with Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index). More recently, the quality of the response to initial therapy, as measured by either PET imaging or by remission duration, has been show to identify individuals at high risk. However, several unmet needs remain, including a better ability to identify high-risk patients at diagnosis, the development of predictive biomarkers for targeted agents, and strategies to reduce the risk of transformation.	2018	07	18	Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program	Kahl	Brad S

27102345	10.1038/modpathol.2016.79	Comprehensive genomic profiling of orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas identifies frequent alterations in MYD88 and chromatin modifiers: new routes to targeted therapies.	Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the orbit and ocular adnexa is the most common primary orbital malignancy. Treatments for low- (extra-nodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas) and high-grade (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) are associated with local and vision-threatening toxicities. High-grade lymphomas relapse frequently and exhibit poor survival rates. Despite advances in genomic profiling and precision medicine, orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas remain poorly characterized molecularly. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas obtained from a single-center using a panel targeting near-term, clinically relevant genes. Potentially actionable mutations and copy number alterations were prioritized based on gain- and loss-of-function analyses, and catalogued, approved, and investigational therapies. Of 36 informative samples, including marginal zone lymphomas (n=20), follicular lymphomas (n=9), and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=7), 53% harbored a prioritized alteration (median=1, range 0-5/sample). MYD88 was the most frequently altered gene in our cohort, with potentially clinically relevant hotspot gain-of-function mutations identified in 71% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 25% of marginal zone lymphomas. Prioritized alterations in epigenetic modulators were common and included gain-of-function EZH2 and loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (14% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 22% of follicular lymphomas contained alterations in each of these two genes). Single prioritized alterations were also identified in the histone methyltransferases KMT2B (follicular lymphoma) and KMT3B (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Loss-of-function mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma), CDKN2A (diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphoma), PTEN (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), ATM (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and NF1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and gain-of-function mutations in the oncogenes HRAS (follicular lymphoma) and NRAS (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were also observed. Together, our study demonstrates that NGS can be used to profile routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas for identification of somatic-driving alterations and nomination of potential therapeutic strategies.	2018	01	12	Mod Pathol	Cani	Andi K
27590521	10.18632/oncotarget.11773	Deep targeted sequencing in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia unveils distinct mutational patterns between genetic subtypes and novel relapse-associated genes.	To characterize the mutational patterns of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) we performed deep next generation sequencing of 872 cancer genes in 172 diagnostic and 24 relapse samples from 172 pediatric ALL patients. We found an overall greater mutational burden and more driver mutations in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients compared to B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. In addition, the majority of the mutations in T-ALL had occurred in the original leukemic clone, while most of the mutations in BCP-ALL were subclonal. BCP-ALL patients carrying any of the recurrent translocations ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL or TCF3-PBX1 harbored few mutations in driver genes compared to other BCP-ALL patients. Specifically in BCP-ALL, we identified ATRX as a novel putative driver gene and uncovered an association between somatic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway at ALL diagnosis and increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, we identified EP300, ARID1A and SH2B3 as relapse-associated genes. The genes highlighted in our study were frequently involved in epigenetic regulation, associated with germline susceptibility to ALL, and present in minor subclones at diagnosis that became dominant at relapse. We observed a high degree of clonal heterogeneity and evolution between diagnosis and relapse in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL, which could have implications for the treatment efficiency.	2018	05	22	Oncotarget	Lindqvist	C Mårten
27729836	10.5808/GI.2016.14.3.78	Mutational Analysis of Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma Using Targeted Sequencing with a Comprehensive Cancer Panel.	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL), is a malignant disorder of cytotoxic lymphocytes of NK or T cells. It is an aggressive neoplasm with a very poor prognosis. Although extranodal NKTCL reportedly has a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus, the molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has been unexplored. The recent technological advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made DNA sequencing cost- and time-effective, with more reliable results. Using the Ion Proton Comprehensive Cancer Panel, we sequenced 409 cancer-related genes to identify somatic mutations in five NKTCL tissue samples. The sequencing analysis detected 25 mutations in 21 genes. Among them, <i>KMT2D</i>, a histone modification-related gene, was the most frequently mutated gene (four of the five cases). This result was consistent with recent NGS studies that have suggested <i>KMT2D</i> as a novel driver gene in NKTCL. Mutations were also found in <i>ARID1A</i>, a chromatin remodeling gene, and <i>TP53</i>, which also recurred in recent NGS studies. We also found mutations in 18 novel candidate genes, with molecular functions that were potentially implicated in cancer development. We suggest that these genes may result in multiple oncogenic events and may be used as potential bio-markers of NKTCL in the future.	2020	09	30	Genomics Inform	Choi	Seungkyu
25444907	10.1016/j.canlet.2014.11.024	Gene mutations in primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts derived from non-small cell lung cancer.	Molecular annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are useful for the preclinical investigation of anticancer drugs and individualized anticancer therapy. We established 23 PDXs from 88 surgical specimens of lung cancer patients and determined gene mutations in these PDXs and their paired primary tumors by ultradeep exome sequencing on 202 cancer-related genes. The numbers of primary tumors with deleterious mutations in TP53, KRAS, PI3KCA, ALK, STK11, and EGFR were 43.5%, 21.7%, 17.4%, 17.4%, 13.0%, and 8.7%, respectively. Other genes with deleterious mutations in ≥3 (13.0%) primary tumors were MLL3, SETD2, ATM, ARID1A, CRIPAK, HGF, BAI3, EP300, KDR, PDGRRA and RUNX1. Of 315 mutations detected in the primary tumors, 293 (93%) were also detected in their corresponding PDXs, indicating that PDXs have the capacity to recapitulate the mutations in primary tumors. Nevertheless, a substantial number of mutations had higher allele frequencies in the PDXs than in the primary tumors, or were not detectable in the primary tumor, suggesting the possibility of tumor cell enrichment in PDXs or heterogeneity in the primary tumors. The molecularly annotated PDXs generated from this study could be useful for future translational studies. 	2015	04	21	Cancer Lett	Hao	Chuncheng
25779943	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2759	Genetics and Prognostication in Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Revelations from Deep Sequencing.	Mounting evidence supports the clinical significance of gene mutations and immunogenetic features in common mature B-cell malignancies. We undertook a detailed characterization of the genetic background of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), using targeted resequencing and explored potential clinical implications in a multinational cohort of 175 patients with SMZL. We identified recurrent mutations in TP53 (16%), KLF2 (12%), NOTCH2 (10%), TNFAIP3 (7%), MLL2 (11%), MYD88 (7%), and ARID1A (6%), all genes known to be targeted by somatic mutation in SMZL. KLF2 mutations were early, clonal events, enriched in patients with del(7q) and IGHV1-2*04 B-cell receptor immunoglobulins, and were associated with a short median time to first treatment (0.12 vs. 1.11 years; P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, mutations in NOTCH2 [HR, 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-4.4; P = 0.044] and 100% germline IGHV gene identity (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.05-4.55; P = 0.036) were independent markers of short time to first treatment, whereas TP53 mutations were an independent marker of short overall survival (HR, 2.36; 95 % CI, 1.08-5.2; P = 0.03). We identify key associations between gene mutations and clinical outcome, demonstrating for the first time that NOTCH2 and TP53 gene mutations are independent markers of reduced treatment-free and overall survival, respectively.	2016	08	02	Clin Cancer Res	Parry	Marina
25918285	10.1200/JCO.2014.59.2444	Genomic Characterization of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in African Americans by Targeted Massively Parallel Sequencing.	Technologic advances have enabled the comprehensive analysis of genetic perturbations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, African Americans have often been underrepresented in these studies. This ethnic group has higher lung cancer incidence and mortality rates, and some studies have suggested a lower incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Herein, we report the most in-depth molecular profile of NSCLC in African Americans to date. A custom panel was designed to cover the coding regions of 81 NSCLC-related genes and 40 ancestry-informative markers. Clinical samples were sequenced on a massively parallel sequencing instrument, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The study cohort included 99 patients (61% males, 94% smokers) comprising 31 squamous and 68 nonsquamous cell carcinomas. We detected 227 nonsilent variants in the coding sequence, including 24 samples with nonoverlapping, classic driver alterations. The frequency of driver mutations was not significantly different from that of whites, and no association was found between genetic ancestry and the presence of somatic mutations. Copy number alteration analysis disclosed distinguishable amplifications in the 3q chromosome arm in squamous cell carcinomas and pointed toward a handful of targetable alterations. We also found frequent SMARCA4 mutations and protein loss, mostly in driver-negative tumors. Our data suggest that African American ancestry may not be significantly different from European/white background for the presence of somatic driver mutations in NSCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using a comprehensive genotyping approach could identify numerous targetable alterations, with potential impact on therapeutic decisions.	2015	08	21	J Clin Oncol	Araujo	Luiz H
26192917	10.1038/ng.3358	Exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of DDX3X in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.	Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a malignant proliferation of CD56(+) and cytoCD3(+) lymphocytes with aggressive clinical course, which is prevalent in Asian and South American populations. The molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has largely remained elusive. We identified somatic gene mutations in 25 people with NKTCL by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed them in an extended validation group of 80 people by targeted sequencing. Recurrent mutations were most frequently located in the RNA helicase gene DDX3X (21/105 subjects, 20.0%), tumor suppressors (TP53 and MGA), JAK-STAT-pathway molecules (STAT3 and STAT5B) and epigenetic modifiers (MLL2, ARID1A, EP300 and ASXL3). As compared to wild-type protein, DDX3X mutants exhibited decreased RNA-unwinding activity, loss of suppressive effects on cell-cycle progression in NK cells and transcriptional activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Clinically, patients with DDX3X mutations presented a poor prognosis. Our work thus contributes to the understanding of the disease mechanism of NKTCL. 	2016	01	13	Nat Genet	Jiang	Lu
26256760	10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00169-2	Integration of gene mutations in risk prognostication for patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy for follicular lymphoma: a retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical trial and validation in a population-based registry.	Follicular lymphoma is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease, but the prognostic value of somatic mutations has not been systematically assessed. We aimed to improve risk stratification of patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy by integrating gene mutations into a prognostic model. We did DNA deep sequencing to retrospectively analyse the mutation status of 74 genes in 151 follicular lymphoma biopsy specimens that were obtained from patients within 1 year before beginning immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). These patients were recruited between May 4, 2000, and Oct 20, 2010, as part of a phase 3 trial (GLSG2000). Eligible patients had symptomatic, advanced stage follicular lymphoma and were previously untreated. The primary endpoints were failure-free survival (defined as less than a partial remission at the end of induction, relapse, progression, or death) and overall survival calculated from date of treatment initiation. Median follow-up was 7·7 years (IQR 5·5-9·3). Mutations and clinical factors were incorporated into a risk model for failure-free survival using multivariable L1-penalised Cox regression. We validated the risk model in an independent population-based cohort of 107 patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma considered ineligible for curative irradiation. Pretreatment biopsies were taken between Feb 24, 2004, and Nov 24, 2009, within 1 year before beginning first-line immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP). Median follow-up was 6·7 years (IQR 5·7-7·6). We established a clinicogenetic risk model (termed m7-FLIPI) that included the mutation status of seven genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP, and CARD11), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. In the training cohort, m7-FLIPI defined a high-risk group (28%, 43/151) with 5-year failure-free survival of 38·29% (95% CI 25·31-57·95) versus 77·21% (95% CI 69·21-86·14) for the low-risk group (hazard ratio [HR] 4·14, 95% CI 2·47-6·93; p&lt;0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 2·02), and outperformed a prognostic model of only gene mutations (HR 3·76, 95% CI 2·10-6·74; p&lt;0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 1·57). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival were 64% and 78%, respectively, with a C-index of 0·80 (95% CI 0·71-0·89). In the validation cohort, m7-FLIPI again defined a high-risk group (22%, 24/107) with 5-year failure-free survival of 25·00% (95% CI 12·50-49·99) versus 68·24% (58·84-79·15) in the low-risk group (HR 3·58, 95% CI 2·00-6·42; p&lt;0.0001). The positive predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival was 72% and 68% for negative predictive value, with a C-index of 0·79 (95% CI 0·69-0·89). In the validation cohort, risk stratification by m7-FLIPI outperformed FLIPI alone (HR 2·18, 95% CI 1·21-3·92), and FLIPI combined with ECOG performance status (HR 2·03, 95% CI 1·12-3·67). Integration of the mutational status of seven genes with clinical risk factors improves prognostication for patients with follicular lymphoma receiving first-line immunochemotherapy and is a promising approach to identify the subset at highest risk of treatment failure.

26415585	10.1038/ncomms9470	Genomic analyses reveal recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifiers and the JAK-STAT pathway in Sézary syndrome.	Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukaemia of mature T cells with poor prognosis and limited options for targeted therapies. The comprehensive genetic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of SS are unknown. Here we integrate whole-genome sequencing (n=6), whole-exome sequencing (n=66) and array comparative genomic hybridization-based copy-number analysis (n=80) of primary SS samples. We identify previously unknown recurrent loss-of-function aberrations targeting members of the chromatin remodelling/histone modification and trithorax families, including ARID1A in which functional loss from nonsense and frameshift mutations and/or targeted deletions is observed in 40.3% of SS genomes. We also identify recurrent gain-of-function mutations targeting PLCG1 (9%) and JAK1, JAK3, STAT3 and STAT5B (JAK/STAT total ∼11%). Functional studies reveal sensitivity of JAK1-mutated primary SS cells to JAK inhibitor treatment. These results highlight the complex genomic landscape of SS and a role for inhibition of JAK/STAT pathways for the treatment of SS.	2016	05	24	Nat Commun	Kiel	Mark J
26446488	10.1038/ncomms9325	LRF maintains genome integrity by regulating the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair.	Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) is a POZ/BTB and Krüppel (POK) transcriptional repressor characterized by context-dependent key roles in cell fate decision and tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate an unexpected transcription-independent function for LRF in the classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. We find that LRF loss in cell lines and mouse tissues results in defective cNHEJ, genomic instability and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Mechanistically, we show that LRF binds and stabilizes DNA-PKcs on DSBs, in turn favouring DNA-PK activity. Importantly, LRF loss restores ionizing radiation sensitivity to p53 null cells, making LRF an attractive biomarker to direct p53-null LRF-deficient tumours towards therapeutic treatments based on genotoxic agents or PARP inhibitors following a synthetic lethal strategy. 	2016	05	06	Nat Commun	Liu	Xue-Song
26468873	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005158	Distinct Viral and Mutational Spectrum of Endemic Burkitt Lymphoma.	Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is primarily found in children in equatorial regions and represents the first historical example of a virus-associated human malignancy. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and MYC translocations are hallmarks of the disease, it is unclear whether other factors may contribute to its development. We performed RNA-Seq on 20 eBL cases from Uganda and showed that the mutational and viral landscape of eBL is more complex than previously reported. First, we found the presence of other herpesviridae family members in 8 cases (40%), in particular human herpesvirus 5 and human herpesvirus 8 and confirmed their presence by immunohistochemistry in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. Second, we identified a distinct latency program in EBV involving lytic genes in association with TCF3 activity. Third, by comparing the eBL mutational landscape with published data on sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL), we detected lower frequencies of mutations in MYC, ID3, TCF3 and TP53, and a higher frequency of mutation in ARID1A in eBL samples. Recurrent mutations in two genes not previously associated with eBL were identified in 20% of tumors: RHOA and cyclin F (CCNF). We also observed that polyviral samples showed lower numbers of somatic mutations in common altered genes in comparison to sBL specimens, suggesting dual mechanisms of transformation, mutation versus virus driven in sBL and eBL respectively. 	2016	04	04	PLoS Pathog	Abate	Francesco
26473533	10.1038/bcj.2015.89	Mutation of chromatin modifiers; an emerging hallmark of germinal center B-cell lymphomas.	Subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas align with different stages of B-cell development. Germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) each share molecular similarities with normal GCB cells. Recent next-generation sequencing studies have gained insight into the genetic etiology of these malignancies and revealed a high frequency of mutations within genes encoding proteins that modifying chromatin. These include activating and inactivating mutations of genes that perform post-translational modification of histones and organize chromatin structure. Here, we discuss the function of histone acetyltransferases (CREBBP, EP300), histone methyltransferases (KDM2C/D, EZH2) and regulators of higher order chromatin structure (HIST1H1C/D/E, ARID1A and SMARCA4) that have been reported to be mutated in ⩾5% of DLBCL, FL or BL. Mutations of these genes are an emerging hallmark of lymphomas with GCB-cell origins, and likely represent the next generation of therapeutic targets for these malignancies. 	2016	01	25	Blood Cancer J	Lunning	M A
26551670	10.1038/ng.3444	Genomic profiling of Sézary syndrome identifies alterations of key T cell signaling and differentiation genes.	Sézary syndrome is a rare leukemic form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterized by generalized redness, scaling, itching and increased numbers of circulating atypical T lymphocytes. It is rarely curable, with poor prognosis. Here we present a multiplatform genomic analysis of 37 patients with Sézary syndrome that implicates dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoint and T cell signaling. Frequent somatic alterations were identified in TP53, CARD11, CCR4, PLCG1, CDKN2A, ARID1A, RPS6KA1 and ZEB1. Activating CCR4 and CARD11 mutations were detected in nearly one-third of patients. ZEB1, encoding a transcription repressor essential for T cell differentiation, was deleted in over one-half of patients. IL32 and IL2RG were overexpressed in nearly all cases. Our results demonstrate profound disruption of key signaling pathways in Sézary syndrome and suggest potential targets for new therapies. 	2016	06	21	Nat Genet	Wang	Linghua
24366360	10.1182/blood-2013-09-525808	The genomic landscape of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is characterized by highly recurring MYD88 and WHIM-like CXCR4 mutations, and small somatic deletions associated with B-cell lymphomagenesis.	The genetic basis for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) remains to be clarified. Although 6q losses are commonly present, recurring gene losses in this region remain to be defined. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 30 WM patients, which included germline/tumor sequencing for 10 patients. Validated somatic mutations occurring in &gt;10% of patients included MYD88, CXCR4, and ARID1A that were present in 90%, 27%, and 17% of patients, respectively, and included the activating mutation L265P in MYD88 and warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infection, and myelokathexis-syndrome-like mutations in CXCR4 that previously have only been described in the germline. WGS also delineated copy number alterations (CNAs) and structural variants in the 10 paired patients. The CXCR4 and CNA findings were validated in independent expansion cohorts of 147 and 30 WM patients, respectively. Validated gene losses due to CNAs involved PRDM2 (93%), BTG1 (87%), HIVEP2 (77%), MKLN1 (77%), PLEKHG1 (70%), LYN (60%), ARID1B (50%), and FOXP1 (37%). Losses in PLEKHG1, HIVEP2, ARID1B, and BCLAF1 constituted the most common deletions within chromosome 6. Although no recurrent translocations were observed, in 2 patients deletions in 6q corresponded with translocation events. These studies evidence highly recurring somatic events, and provide a genomic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of WM. 	2014	06	16	Blood	Hunter	Zachary R
24435047	10.1182/blood-2013-05-500264	Mutations in linker histone genes HIST1H1 B, C, D, and E; OCT2 (POU2F2); IRF8; and ARID1A underlying the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the western world. FL carries characteristic recurrent structural genomic aberrations. However, information regarding the coding genome in FL is still evolving. Here, we describe the results of massively parallel exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array genomic profiling of 11 highly purified FL cases, and 1 transformed FL case and the validation of selected mutations in 102 FL cases. We report the identification of 15 novel recurrently mutated genes in FL. These include frequent mutations in the linker histone genes HIST1H1 B-E (27%) and mutations in OCT2 (also known as POU2F2; 8%), IRF8 (6%), and ARID1A (11%). A subset of the mutations in HIST1H1 B-E affected binding to DNMT3B, and mutations in HIST1H1 B-E and in EZH2 or ARID1A were largely mutually exclusive, implicating HIST1H1 B-E in epigenetic deregulation in FL. Mutations in OCT2 (POU2F2) affected its transcriptional and functional properties as measured through luciferase assays, the biological analysis of stably transduced cell lines, and global expression profiling. Finally, multiple novel mutated genes located within regions of acquired uniparental disomy in FL are identified. In aggregate, these data substantially broaden our understanding of the genomic pathogenesis of FL. 	2014	05	09	Blood	Li	Hongxiu
23292937	10.1073/pnas.1205299110	Genetic heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of lymphoma in adults. The disease exhibits a striking heterogeneity in gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes, but its genetic causes remain to be fully defined. Through whole genome and exome sequencing, we characterized the genetic diversity of DLBCL. In all, we sequenced 73 DLBCL primary tumors (34 with matched normal DNA). Separately, we sequenced the exomes of 21 DLBCL cell lines. We identified 322 DLBCL cancer genes that were recurrently mutated in primary DLBCLs. We identified recurrent mutations implicating a number of known and not previously identified genes and pathways in DLBCL including those related to chromatin modification (ARID1A and MEF2B), NF-κB (CARD11 and TNFAIP3), PI3 kinase (PIK3CD, PIK3R1, and MTOR), B-cell lineage (IRF8, POU2F2, and GNA13), and WNT signaling (WIF1). We also experimentally validated a mutation in PIK3CD, a gene not previously implicated in lymphomas. The patterns of mutation demonstrated a classic long tail distribution with substantial variation of mutated genes from patient to patient and also between published studies. Thus, our study reveals the tremendous genetic heterogeneity that underlies lymphomas and highlights the need for personalized medicine approaches to treating these patients.	2013	03	21	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Zhang	Jenny
22585168	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0208	Molecular ontogeny of donor-derived follicular lymphomas occurring after hematopoietic cell transplantation.	The relative timing of genetic alterations that contribute to follicular lymphoma remains unknown. We analyzed a donor-recipient pair who both developed grade 2/3A follicular lymphoma 7 years after allogeneic transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions. Both patients harbored identical BCL2/IGH rearrangements also present in 1 in 2,000 cells in the donor lymphocyte infusion, and the same V(D)J rearrangement, which underwent somatic hypermutation both before and after clonal divergence. Exome sequencing of both follicular lymphomas identified 15 shared mutations, of which 14 (including alterations in EP300 and KLHL6) were recovered from the donor lymphocyte infusion by ultra-deep sequencing (average read coverage, 361,723), indicating acquisition at least 7 years before clinical presentation. Six additional mutations were present in only one follicular lymphoma and not the donor lymphocyte infusion, including an ARID1A premature stop, indicating later acquisition during clonal divergence. Thus, ultrasensitive sequencing can map clonal evolution within rare subpopulations during human lymphomagenesis in vivo. For the first time, we define the molecular ontogeny of follicular lymphoma during clonal evolution in vivo. By using ultrasensitive mutation detection, we mapped the time-course of somatic alterations after passage of a malignant ancestor by hematopoietic cell transplantation.	2013	01	15	Cancer Discov	Weigert	Oliver
22915242	10.1007/s00428-012-1303-2	ARID1A expression loss in gastric cancer: pathway-dependent roles with and without Epstein-Barr virus infection and microsatellite instability.	The AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene (ARID1A), which encodes one of the subunits in the Switch/Sucrose Nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, carries mutations and is responsible for loss of protein expression in gastric carcinoma, particularly with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and a microsatellite instability-high phenotype. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the significance of ARID1A loss in 857 gastric carcinoma cases, including 67 EBV(+) and 136 MLH1-lost gastric carcinomas (corresponding to a microsatellite instability-high phenotype). Loss of ARID1A expression was significantly more frequent in EBV(+) (23/67; 34 %) and MLH1-lost (40/136; 29 %) gastric carcinomas than in EBV(-)MLH1-preserved (32/657; 5 %) gastric carcinomas (P &lt; 0.01). Loss of ARID1A correlated with larger tumor size, advanced invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in EBV(-)MLH1-preserved gastric carcinoma. A correlation was found only with tumor size and diffuse-type histology in MLH1-lost gastric carcinoma, but no correlation was observed in EBV(+) gastric carcinoma. Loss of ARID1A expression in EBV(+) gastric carcinoma was highly frequent in the early stage of gastric carcinoma, although EBV infection did not cause downregulation of ARID1A: EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas (n = 8) and lymphomas (n = 15) failed to show loss of ARID1A, and EBV infection did not cause loss of ARID1A in gastric carcinoma cell lines. Taken together, loss of ARID1A may be an early change in carcinogenesis and may precede EBV infection in gastric epithelial cells, while loss of ARID1A promotes cancer progression in gastric cancer cells without EBV infection or loss of MLH1 expression. Loss of ARID1A has different and pathway-dependent roles in gastric carcinoma.	2012	12	31	Virchows Arch	Abe	Hiroyuki
22931316	10.1056/NEJMoa1200710	MYD88 L265P somatic mutation in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is an incurable, IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). The underlying mutation in this disorder has not been delineated. We performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells in 30 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the findings in samples from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy donors. Among the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a somatic variant (T→C) in LPL cells was identified at position 38182641 at 3p22.2 in the samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20 samples from patients with unpaired samples. This variant predicted an amino acid change (L265P) in MYD88, a mutation that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-κB signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3 patients with non-IgM-secreting LPL (91% of all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal tissue samples from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88 signaling reduced IκBα and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, as well as NF-κB nuclear staining, in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Somatic variants in ARID1A in 5 of 30 patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had wild-type MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2. MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia that can be useful in differentiating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from B-cell disorders that have some of the same features.

23091298	10.1182/blood-2012-06-437624	Targeted genomic sequencing of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma identifies recurrent alterations in antiapoptotic and chromatin-remodeling genes.	To ascertain the genetic basis of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (pBL), we performed clinical-grade next-generation sequencing of 182 cancer-related genes on 29 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded primary pBL samples. Ninety percent of cases had at least one mutation or genetic alteration, most commonly involving MYC and TP53. EBV(-) cases were more likely than EBV(+) cases to have multiple mutations (P &lt; .0001). Alterations in tumor-related genes not previously described in BL were identified. Truncating mutations in ARID1A, a member of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, were seen in 17% of cases. MCL1 pathway alterations were found in 22% of cases and confirmed in an expanded panel. Other clinically relevant genomic alterations were found in 20% of cases. Our data suggest the roles of MCL1 and ARID1A in BL pathogenesis and demonstrate that comprehensive genomic profiling may identify additional treatment options in refractory disease.	2013	02	15	Blood	Giulino-Roth	Lisa
23143597	10.1038/ng.2468	The genetic landscape of mutations in Burkitt lymphoma.	Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of MYC, but the contribution of other genetic mutations to the disease is largely unknown. Here, we describe the first completely sequenced genome from a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and germline DNA from the same affected individual. We further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that were recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Our data implicate a number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B, SALL3, FTCD and PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas and not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work thus elucidates commonly occurring gene-coding mutations in Burkitt lymphoma and implicates ID3 as a new tumor suppressor gene.	2013	02	13	Nat Genet	Love	Cassandra
21590771	10.1002/path.2911	Loss of BAF250a (ARID1A) is frequent in high-grade endometrial carcinomas.	Mutation of the ARID1A gene and loss of the corresponding protein BAF250a has recently been described as a frequent event in clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary. To determine whether BAF250a loss is common in other malignancies, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BAF250a was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) in more than 3000 cancers, including carcinomas of breast, lung, thyroid, endometrium, kidney, stomach, oral cavity, cervix, pancreas, colon and rectum, as well as endometrial stromal sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, sex cord-stromal tumours and four major types of lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma). We found that BAF250a loss is frequent in endometrial carcinomas but infrequent in other types of malignancies, with loss observed in 29% (29/101) of grade 1 or 2 and 39% (44/113) of grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium, 18% (17/95) of uterine serous carcinomas and 26% (6/23) of uterine clear cell carcinomas. Since endometrial cancers showed BAF250a loss, we stained whole tissue sections for BAF250a expression in nine cases of atypical hyperplasia and 10 cases of atypical endometriosis. Of the nine cases of complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia, all showed BAF250a expression; however, of 10 cases of atypical endometriosis (the putative precursor lesion for ovarian clear cell and endometrioid carcinoma), one case showed loss of staining for BAF250a in the atypical areas, with retention of staining in areas of non-atypical endometriosis. This was the sole case that recurred as an endometrioid carcinoma, indicating that BAF250a loss may be an early event in carcinogenesis. Since BAF250a loss is seen in endometrial carcinomas at a rate similar to that seen in ovarian carcinomas of clear cell and endometrioid type, and is uncommon in other malignancies, we conclude that loss of BAF250a is a particular feature of carcinomas arising from endometrial glandular epithelium.	2011	08	24	J Pathol	Wiegand	Kimberly C
19066270	10.1093/jnci/djn416	The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and glucocorticoid resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Glucocorticoids are used in the curative treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Resistance to glucocorticoids is an important adverse prognostic factor in newly diagnosed ALL patients but its mechanism is unknown. Because SWI/SNF complex-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for glucocorticoid transcriptional activity in vitro, we investigated whether expression of subunits of the SWI/SNF complex was related to glucocorticoid resistance in ALL. Gene expression and in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone and dexamethasone were assessed in a training set of primary ALL cells from 177 children with newly diagnosed ALL and a validation set of cells from an independent cohort of 95 ALL patients. The global test method was used to select pathways whose genes were associated with drug sensitivity. Genes involved in chromatin remodeling were identified by use of the Gene Ontology database. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down mRNA expression of SMARCA4 in glucocorticoid-sensitive Jurkat human ALL cells. Spearman rank correlation, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression were used to investigate associations between gene expression and glucocorticoid sensitivity. All statistical tests were two-sided. Statistically significant associations between decreased expression in ALL cells of genes for core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex-SMARCA4, ARID1A, and SMARCB1-and resistance to prednisolone and dexamethasone were identified in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, expression of SMARCA4 (P &lt; .001 and r = -0.43), ARID1A (P = .016 and r = -0.29), and SMARCB1 (P = .019 and r = -0.29) in ALL cells was statistically significantly associated with dexamethasone sensitivity, and SMARCA4 expression (P = .018 and r = -0.28) was statistically significantly associated with prednisolone sensitivity. Prednisolone resistance was higher in SMARCA4 shRNA-transfected Jurkat cells (drug concentration lethal to 50% of the leukemia cells [LC(50)] = 277 microM) than in control shRNA-transfected cells (LC(50) = 174 microM, difference = 103 microM, 95% confidence interval of the difference = 100 to 106 microM; P &lt; .001, t test). Decreased expression of as many as three subunits of the SWI/SNF complex appears to be associated with glucocorticoid resistance in primary ALL cells.	2009	01	06	J Natl Cancer Inst	Pottier	Nicolas
33788417	10.1002/pbc.29036	Novel risk factors for glucarpidase use in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Hispanic ethnicity, age, and the ABCC4 gene.	Carboxypeptidase G<sub>2</sub> (CPDG<sub>2</sub> ; glucarpidase) is a rescue drug for patients at risk for kidney injury from high-dose methotrexate (MTX). As there are no strategies for predicting patients who will require CDPG<sub>2</sub> , we evaluated the role of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors for CPDG<sub>2</sub> use. Cases who received CPDG<sub>2</sub> and controls who did not were identified by chart review of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received MTX doses between 1000 and 5000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> between 2010 and 2017. We used multivariable Bayesian logistic regression to evaluate the association of CPDG<sub>2</sub> use with demographic and clinical variables and, on a subset of patients, with genetic ancestry and 49 single nucleotide variants previously associated with MTX toxicity. We identified 423 patients who received 1592 doses of MTX. Of the 18 patients who received CPDG<sub>2</sub> , 17 (94%) were Hispanic. No patients who received 1000 or 2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of MTX received CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio: 4.68; 95% compatibility interval: 1.63-15.06) and older age (1.87 [1.17-3.17]) were associated with receiving CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Of the 177 patients in the genomic cohort, 11 received CPDG<sub>2</sub> . Each additional G allele of rs7317112 in ABCC4 increased the odds of requiring CPDG<sub>2</sub> (3.10 [1.12-6.75]). Six other loci (NTRK1/rs10908521, TSG1/rs9345389, STT3B/rs1353327, SCLO1B1/rs4149056, GATA3/rs3824662, ARID5B/rs10821936) demonstrated probabilities of association between 88% and 97%. We demonstrated that demographic characteristics, including Hispanic ethnicity and age, are associated with CPDG<sub>2</sub> use. Additionally, we provide evidence that inherited genetic variation is associated with risk of requiring CPDG<sub>2</sub> . If validated in independent populations, this information could be leveraged to develop targeted toxicity prevention strategies for children with ALL.	2022	03	11	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Zobeck	Mark C
33891562	10.18632/aging.202903	Age-related differences of genetic susceptibility to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Inherited predispositions to acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been well investigated in pediatric patients, but studies on adults, particularly Chinese patients, are limited. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 466 all-age Chinese patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1,466 non-ALL controls to estimate the impact of age on ALL susceptibility in the Chinese population. Among the 17 reported loci, 8 have been validated in pediatric and 1 in adult patients. The strongest association signal was identified at <i>ARID5B</i> locus and gradually decreased with age, while the signal at <i>GATA3</i> exhibited the opposite trend and significantly impact on adult patients. With genome-wide approaches, germline variants at 2q14.3 rank as the top inherited predisposition to adult patients (e.g., rs73956024, <i>P</i> = 4.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and separate the genetic risk of pediatric vs. adult patients (<i>P</i> = 3.6 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), whereas variants at 15q25.3 (e.g., rs11638062) have a similar impact on patients in different age groups (overall <i>P</i> = 2.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Our analysis highlights the impact of age on genetic susceptibility to ALL in Chinese patients.	2021	07	26	Aging (Albany NY)	Hao	Qing
31573954	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0190	<i>ARID5B</i> Influences Antimetabolite Drug Sensitivity and Prognosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.	Treatment outcomes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved steadily, but a significant proportion of patients still experience relapse due to drug resistance, which is partly explained by inherited and/or somatic genetic alternations. Recently, we and others have identified genetic variants in the <i>ARID5B</i> gene associated with susceptibility to ALL and also with relapse. In this study, we sought to characterize the molecular pathway by which ARID5B affects antileukemic drug response in patients with ALL. We analyzed association of ARID5B expression in primary human ALL blasts with molecular subtypes and treatment outcome. Subsequent mechanistic studies were performed in ALL cell lines by manipulating <i>ARID5B</i> expression isogenically, in which we evaluated drug sensitivity, metabolism, and molecular signaling events. <i>ARID5B</i> expression varied substantially by ALL subtype, with the highest level being observed in hyperdiploid ALL. Lower <i>ARID5B</i> expression at diagnosis was associated with the risk of ALL relapse, and further reduction was noted at ALL relapse. In isogenic ALL cell models <i>in vitro</i>, <i>ARID5B</i> knockdown led to resistance specific to antimetabolite drugs (i.e., 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate), without significantly affecting sensitivity to other antileukemic agents. <i>ARID5B</i> downregulation significantly inhibited ALL cell proliferation and caused partial cell-cycle arrest. At the molecular level, the cell-cycle checkpoint regulator p21 (encoded by <i>CDKN1A</i>) was most consistently modulated by ARID5B, plausibly as its direct transcription regulation target. Our data indicate that ARID5B is an important molecular determinant of antimetabolite drug sensitivity in ALL, in part, through p21-mediated effects on cell-cycle progression.	2020	10	01	Clin Cancer Res	Xu	Heng
31704777	10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106339	Novel phenotypes observed in patients with <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia/familial thrombocytopenia syndrome and a biallelic <i>ARID5B</i> risk allele as leukaemogenic cofactor.	<i>Background.</i> The phenotypes of patients with the recently discovered, dominant, <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome are variable, and the exact mechanism of leukaemogenesis remains unclear. <i>Patients and Methods.</i> Here, we present novel clinical and laboratory phenotypes of seven individuals from three families with <i>ETV6</i> germline mutations and a refined genetic analysis of one child with additional high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL), aiming to elucidate second oncogenic hits. <i>Results.</i> Four individuals from two pedigrees harboured one novel or one previously described variant in the central domain of <i>ETV6</i> (c.592C&gt;T, p.Gln198* or c.641C&gt;T, p.Pro241Leu, respectively). Neutropenia was an accompanying feature in one of these families that also harboured a variant in <i>RUNX1</i> (c.1098_1103dup, p.Ile366_Gly367dup), while in the other, an autism-spectrum disorder was observed. In the third family, the index patient suffered from HD-ALL and life-threatening pulmonary mucor mycosis, and had a positive family history of 'immune' thrombocytopenia. Genetic analyses revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the ETS domain of <i>ETV6</i> (c.1136T&gt;C, p.Leu379Pro) along with absence of heterozygosity of chromosome (10)(q21.2q21.3), yielding a biallelic leukaemia risk allele in <i>ARID5B</i> (rs7090445-C). The neutrophil function was normal in all individuals tested, and the platelet immune histochemistry of all three pedigrees showed delta-storage-pool defect-like features and cytoskeletal defects. <i>Conclusions.</i> Our clinical observations and results of high-resolution genetic analyses extend the spectrum of possible phenotypes cosegregating with <i>ETV6</i> germline mutations. Further, we propose <i>ARID5B</i> as potential leukaemogenic cofactor in patients with <i>ETV6</i>-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome.	2021	06	08	J Med Genet	Karastaneva	Anna
31870219	10.1080/08880018.2019.1705949	Association of <i>ABCC2</i> with levels and toxicity of methotrexate in Malaysian Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).	Studies had shown that genetic polymorphism plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics variation of high dose methotrexate (MTX), 5000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> regimen. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic variations associated with the serum level and toxicity of MTX in Malaysian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thirty-eight patients were genotyped for rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>), rs4948496 (<i>ARID5B</i>), rs1801133 (<i>MTHFR</i>) and rs4149056 (<i>SLCO1B1</i>). Serum levels of MTX at 48 h post 24 h of intravenous infusion were analyzed by high<i>-</i>performance liquid chromatography<i>-</i>mass spectrometry. The <i>ABCC2</i> genotype was significantly associated with the serum levels of MTX at 48 h after treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Patients with CT and TT of rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>) and TC and CC of rs4948496 (<i>ARID5B</i>) were significantly associated with leukopenia grade I-IV (Fisher Exact Test; <i>p</i> = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). The three most common MTX related toxicities were leukopenia (60.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase enzyme (47.4%), and thrombocytopenia (47.4%). Our results demonstrate that by prescreening of patients for <i>ABCC2</i> and <i>ARID5B</i> associated with the serum levels and adverse effects of MTX would identify patients at risk and therefore help a pediatric oncologist to personalize chemotherapy drugs for precision health.	2020	11	13	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Razali	Rizal Husaini
32488880	10.1002/jcla.23414	Association of TLX1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Han Chinese children.	Studies on gene polymorphism association are centered on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a common hematological malignancy in children younger than 16 years. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some genes, such as ARID5B and CDKN2B, are associated with the risk of childhood ALL. T-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1), a member of the HOX gene family, was identified based on its abnormal expression in T-lineage leukemia. This study aimed to determine whether TLX1 is associated with B-ALL and which SNP plays a significant role in ALL. A total of 217 cases of ALL and 241 controls were included in this study. Six tag SNPs (rs75329544, rs946328, rs12415670, rs2075879, rs17113735, and rs1051723) were selected, and genotyping was carried out on Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Rs17113735 was possibly the risk locus associated with increased risk for ALL, whereas rs946328 was possibly associated with decreased risk for ALL. Moreover, rs17113735 was likely to be the risk locus for B-cell ALL (B-ALL), and rs2075879 was associated with decreased risk for B-ALL (P &lt; .05). All SNPs in the two sample types (ALL and B-ALL samples) demonstrated linkage disequilibrium except between rs75329544 and rs2075879. Haplotype analysis showed no significant difference between the cases and controls in the two sample types. TLX1 gene polymorphisms are associated with ALL (rs17113735 and rs946328) and possibly play a significant role in B-ALL (rs17113735 and rs2075879). This work provides a reference for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.	2021	07	05	J Clin Lab Anal	Mei	Endian
30770347	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0801	Is There Etiologic Heterogeneity between Subtypes of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? A Review of Variation in Risk by Subtype.	Although substantial advances in the identification of cytogenomic subtypes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been made in recent decades, epidemiologic research characterizing the etiologic heterogeneity of ALL by subtype has not kept pace. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning subtype-specific epidemiologic risk factor associations with ALL subtype defined by immunophenotype (e.g., B-cell vs. T-cell) and cytogenomics (including gross chromosomal events characterized by recurring numerical and structural abnormalities, along with cryptic balanced rearrangements, and focal gene deletions). In case-control analyses investigating nongenetic risk factors, home paint exposure is associated with hyperdiploid, <i>MLL</i>-rearranged, and <i>ETV6</i>-<i>RUNX1</i> subtypes, yet there are few differences in risk factor associations between T- and B-ALL. Although the association between maternal smoking and ALL overall has been null, maternal smoking is associated with an increasing number of gene deletions among cases. GWAS-identified variants in <i>ARID5B</i> have been the most extensively studied and are strongly associated with hyperdiploid B-ALL. <i>GATA3</i> single nucleotide variant rs3824662 shows a strong association with Ph-like ALL (OR = 3.14). However, there have been relatively few population-based studies of adequate sample size to uncover risk factors that may define etiologic heterogeneity between and within the currently defined cytogenomic ALL subtypes.	2020	07	16	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Williams	Lindsay A
30810385	10.1089/gtmb.2018.0283	Association of ARID5B and IKZF1 Variants with Leukemia from Northern India.	Leukemia is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by elevated proliferation of white blood cells. Various genetic studies have assessed the contributory roles of several single nucleotide polymorphisms with the development of leukemia. The role of genetic variation in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes has previously been identified in various population groups; however, the role of these variants in the north Indian populations of Jammu and Kashmir is unknown. In this study, we explored the association of the newly identified genetic variants, rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1, with leukemic patients from Jammu and Kashmir of northern India. The variants were genotyped using TaqMan allele discrimination assays for 616 individuals (210 leukemic cases and 406 healthy controls). The association of each SNP with the disease was evaluated using logistic regression. It was observed that the variants rs6964823 (IKZF1) and rs10740055 (ARID5B) showed significant associations with odds ratio (OR) and p-values of 1.5 (1.0-2.3 at 95% confidence interval [CI]) and 0.04; and 2.5 (1.5-4.1 at 95% CI) and 0.0002, respectively. We also evaluated the cumulative effect for both the variants by combining the risk genotypes and obtained and OR of 4.9. It was found that the variants rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1 act individually and additively as risk factors in the development of leukemia in the populations of Jammu and Kashmir in Northern India.	2019	05	21	Genet Test Mol Biomarkers	Bhat	Amrita
31076442	10.1182/blood.2018874503	The enhancer RNA <i>ARIEL</i> activates the oncogenic transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 regulates the transcriptional program in T-ALL. ARID5B is one of the critical downstream targets of TAL1, which further activates the oncogenic regulatory circuit in T-ALL cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular functions of the noncoding RNA, ARID5B-inducing enhancer associated long noncoding RNA (<i>ARIEL</i>), in T-ALL pathogenesis. We demonstrated that <i>ARIEL</i> is specifically activated in <i>TAL1</i> <sup>+</sup> T-ALL cases, and its expression is associated with <i>ARID5B</i> enhancer activity. <i>ARIEL</i> recruits mediator proteins to the <i>ARID5B</i> enhancer, promotes enhancer-promoter interactions, and activates the expression of <i>ARID5B</i>, thereby positively regulating the TAL1-induced transcriptional program and the <i>MYC</i> oncogene. The TAL1 complex coordinately regulates the expression of <i>ARIEL</i> Knockdown of <i>ARIEL</i> inhibits cell growth and survival of T-ALL cells in culture and blocks disease progression in a murine xenograft model. Our results indicate that <i>ARIEL</i> plays an oncogenic role as an enhancer RNA in T-ALL.	2020	01	14	Blood	Tan	Shi Hao
31111395	10.1007/s12185-019-02658-2	ARID5B gene polymorphisms and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.	Genome-wide association studies have implicated several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) gene in children with ALL; however, whether ARID5B variants (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) are associated with childhood ALL remains controversial. We performed this study to obtain more conclusive results. Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 26 studies were included. Analyses stratified by ethnicity revealed that three polymorphisms are significantly associated with the odds of childhood ALL in Caucasians, and rs10994982 and rs7089424 with the odds of childhood ALL in Asian populations. Furthermore, subtype analyses provided strong evidence that the three polymorphisms are highly associated with the risk of B-cell ALL. Our findings indicate that the ARID5B variants (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) are significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL.	2019	12	11	Int J Hematol	Yang	Ju-Le
31221981	10.1038/s12276-019-0230-6	The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.	Recent studies on mutations in cancer genomes have distinguished driver mutations from passenger mutations, which occur as byproducts of cancer development. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) project identified 299 genes and 24 pathways/biological processes that drive tumor progression (Cell 173: 371-385 e318, 2018). Of the 299 driver genes, 12 genes are involved in histones, histone methylation, and demethylation (Table 1). Among these 12 genes, those encoding the histone demethylases JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A were identified as cancer driver genes. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH)1/2, drive tumor progression by producing an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which is a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate, O<sub>2</sub>-dependent dioxygenases such as Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases, and DNA demethylases. Studies on oncometabolites suggest that histone demethylases mediate metabolic changes in chromatin structure. We have reviewed the most recent findings regarding cancer-specific metabolic reprogramming and the tumor-suppressive roles of JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A. We have also discussed mutations in other isoforms such as the JARID1A, 1B, 1D of KDM5 subfamilies and the JMJD3/KDM6B of KDM6 subfamilies, which play opposing roles in tumor progression as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer cell type.

31227872	10.1007/s00277-019-03730-x	Variants in ARID5B gene are associated with the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Mexican children.	A high impact of ARID5B SNPs on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility has been described in Hispanic children; therefore, it is relevant to know if they influence the high incidence of childhood-ALL in Mexicans. Seven SNPs (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, rs4948488) of ARID5B were analyzed in 384 controls and 298 ALL children using genomic DNA and TaqMan probes. The SNPs were analyzed for deviation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotypic and allelic frequencies between controls and patients. The association between SNPs and ALL susceptibility was calculated, and haplotype and ancestry analyses were conducted. All SNPs were associated with ALL, pre-B ALL, and hyperdiploid-ALL susceptibility (p &lt; 0.05). No association with T-ALL and gene fusions was found (p &gt; 0.05). The seven SNPs were associated with risk of pre-B ALL in younger children; however, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, and rs4948488 were not associated with susceptibility in older children and adolescents. The CAG haplotype (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) was strongly associated with ALL risk in our population (p &lt; 0.00001). The frequency of all risk alleles in our ALL, pre-B, and hyperdiploid-ALL patients was higher than that in Hispanic children reported. This is the first report showing the association between rs2393732, rs2393782, and rs4948488 with pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL children. The G allele at rs2893881 confers major risk for pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL in Mexican (OR, 2.29) than in Hispanic children (OR, 1.71). The genetic background of our population could influence the susceptibility to ALL and explain its high incidence in Mexico.	2019	09	17	Ann Hematol	Reyes-León	Adriana
31274788	10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000038	Genetic polymorphisms of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 are associated with B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Chinese pediatric population.	Several ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were confirmed to be significantly associated with the susceptibility of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on Caucasian populations in previous studies. Similar investigations in Asian populations were less. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between ARID5B SNPs rs7089424, rs10994982, and the risk of ALL in Chinese pediatric population. A total of 190 pediatric ALL patients and 270 controls were enrolled in this study. PCR amplification combined with mass spectrometry were used to evaluate the genotypes of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982. χ test was used in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the SNPs for analyzing statistical differences between patients and controls. There were significant differences in the risk allele frequencies of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 between B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients and controls (rs7089424, G allele: p = 0.001; rs10994982, A allele: p = 0.000). The genotype distributions of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 were also statistically different in B-ALL patients compared with controls (rs7089424, p = 0.004; rs10994982, p = 0.001). Further analyzing the relevance of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 genotypes to clinical risk classification of ALL showed GG genotype of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 were strikingly correlated with the medium-risk and low-risk groups of B-ALL. Finally, GG and GT genotypes of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 seemed to be responsible for the hyperdiploid subtype susceptibility of childhood B-ALL. ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 might serve as genetic susceptibility markers for B-ALL in Chinese pediatric population. Moreover, the two ARID5B SNPs are associated with the risk of B-hyperdiploid ALL, which had a better therapeutic response than other ALL subtypes.	2020	06	23	J Chin Med Assoc	Tao	Ran
31350265	10.1182/blood.2018890764	Inherited genetic susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome.	Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 20-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and distinct somatic features, including CRLF2 rearrangement in ∼50% of cases; however, the role of inherited genetic variation in DS-ALL susceptibility is unknown. We report the first genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, comprising a meta-analysis of 4 independent studies, with 542 DS-ALL cases and 1192 DS controls. We identified 4 susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance: rs58923657 near IKZF1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; Pmeta = 5.32 × 10-15), rs3731249 in CDKN2A (OR, 3.63; Pmeta = 3.91 × 10-10), rs7090445 in ARID5B (OR, 1.60; Pmeta = 8.44 × 10-9), and rs3781093 in GATA3 (OR, 1.73; Pmeta = 2.89 × 10-8). We performed DS-ALL vs non-DS ALL case-case analyses, comparing risk allele frequencies at these and other established susceptibility loci (BMI1, PIP4K2A, and CEBPE) and found significant association with DS status for CDKN2A (OR, 1.58; Pmeta = 4.1 × 10-4). This association was maintained in separate regression models, both adjusting for and stratifying on CRLF2 overexpression and other molecular subgroups, indicating an increased penetrance of CDKN2A risk alleles in children with DS. Finally, we investigated functional significance of the IKZF1 risk locus, and demonstrated mapping to a B-cell super-enhancer, and risk allele association with decreased enhancer activity and differential protein binding. IKZF1 knockdown resulted in significantly higher proliferation in DS than non-DS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate a higher penetrance of the CDKN2A risk locus in DS and serve as a basis for further biological insights into DS-ALL etiology.	2020	02	03	Blood	Brown	Austin L

We investigated the association between the <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 C &gt; T, rs10994982 A &gt; G, and susceptibility to ALL in a cohort of Egyptian individuals and investigated their role in relation to disease outcome. Real-time PCR typing was done for <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and rs10994982 SNPs for 128 pediatric ALL (pALL), 45 adult ALL (aALL), and 436 healthy controls. Significant risk associations were found between the C allele (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.02), CC genotype (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.72), CT genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.011, OR = 1.45) of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and pediatric ALL especially T-ALL and adult ALL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The CA haplotype (C allele of rs10821936 + A allele of rs10994982) was associated with the risk of ALL either pediatric ALL or adult ALL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In the studied Egyptian population, it can be concluded that the C allele, CC, and CT genotypes of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and the CA haplotype may be a susceptibility risk factor for pediatric and adult ALL. However, the SNPs of <i>ARID5B</i> rs10821936 and rs10994982 were not found to be strongly associated with ALL outcomes.	2020	04	09	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Mosaad	Youssef M

29335448	10.1038/s41598-017-19127-7	Regional evaluation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia genetic susceptibility loci among Japanese.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed mostly in populations of European and Hispanic ancestry have confirmed an inherited genetic basis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but these associations are less clear in other races/ethnicities. DNA samples from ALL patients (aged 0-19 years) previously enrolled onto a Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group trial were collected during 2013-2015, and underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping resulting in 527 B-cell ALL for analysis. Cases and control data for 3,882 samples from the Nagahama Study Group and Aichi Cancer Center Study were combined, and association analyses across 10 previous GWAS-identified regions were performed after targeted SNP imputation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in Japanese and other populations were evaluated using the varLD score based on 1000 Genomes data. Risk associations for ARID5B (rs10821936, OR = 1.84, P = 6 × 10<sup>-17</sup>) and PIP4K2A (rs7088318, OR = 0.76, P = 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) directly transferred to Japanese, and the IKZF1 association was detected by an alternate SNP (rs1451367, OR = 1.52, P = 2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Marked regional LD differences between Japanese and Europeans was observed for most of the remaining loci for which associations did not transfer, including CEBPE, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and ELK3. This study represents a first step towards characterizing the role of genetic susceptibility in childhood ALL risk in Japanese.	2018	11	20	Sci Rep	Urayama	Kevin Y
29504848	10.1080/08916934.2018.1446525	Signalling pathways identified in salivary glands from primary Sjögren's syndrome patients reveal enhanced adipose tissue development.	A characteristic feature of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is the destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands mediated by mononuclear cell infiltration. Adipocytes can also occupy a large portion of the salivary gland (SG) tissue area, although little is known about their significance in pSS. We have previously investigated adipose tissue infiltration in SG biopsies from pSS patients and non-SS sicca controls. Our findings indicated the distinct incidence of adipose tissue replacement in pSS patients, where adipocytes were detected in interleukin (IL) 6 rich regions. We now aimed to examine the development of adipocytes in the SG microenvironment, and delineate their possible involvement in immune reactions. A microarray analysis was performed on SG from 6 pSS patients and 6 non-SS controls, where the expression levels of genes involved in adipose tissue development, inflammatory responses, and lymphoma development were assessed. Real-time PCR was carried out on SG from 14 pSS patients and 15 non-SS controls to account for IL6, IL10, and IL17 mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen SG tissue using IL17 was also conducted. Our results indicate signalling pathways identified in SG of pSS patients displayed genes leading to prominent adipose tissue development and reduced mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (ARID5B, OXCT1, BDH1, SOX8, HMGCS2, FTO, ECHS1, PCCA, ACADL and ACADVL), inflammatory responses (IL1R1, IL7R, IL10RA, IL15, IL18RAP, CCL2, CCL5, CCL22, CXCR6, CD14, and CD48), and lymphoma development via JAK-STAT signalling (STAT2, TYK2, EBI3, FAS, TNFRSF1B, MAP3K8, HMOX1, LTB, TNF, STAT1, and BAK1). Genes involved in interferon production and signalling were also detected (IRF1, IRF9, and IRF7), in addition to IL6, IL10, and IL17. Higher mRNA levels of IL6, IL17 and IL10 were observed in the SG of pSS patients compared to controls. Moreover, IL17 positive cells were detected mostly interstitially in the SG and around adipocytes, also within the focal infiltrates. In conclusion, adipocyte development seems to be more prominent in the SG of pSS patients, where adipose tissue replacement is also evident. Whether this is due to disease progression, or the repair process, remains to be investigated. Detection of IL17 positive adipocytes in the target organ suggests their involvement in immune reactions.	2019	10	03	Autoimmunity	Aqrawi	Lara A
29654272	10.1038/s41375-018-0110-4	Identification of novel lncRNAs regulated by the TAL1 complex in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB) positively regulate each other and coordinately regulate the expression of their downstream target genes in T-ALL cells. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells. This included a known lncRNA (lnc-OAZ3-2:7) located near the RORC gene, which was expressed in normal thymocytes but repressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cells.	2019	06	13	Leukemia	Ngoc	Phuong Cao Thi
28256501	10.1038/ncomms14616	Genetic and regulatory mechanism of susceptibility to high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at 10p21.2.	Despite high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL) being the most common subgroup of paediatric ALL, its aetiology remains unknown. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated association at 10q21.2. Here, we sought to determine how this region influences HD-ALL risk. We impute genotypes across the locus, finding the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7090445 highly associated with HD-ALL (P=1.54 × 10<sup>-38</sup>), and residing in a predicted enhancer element. We show this region physically interacts with the transcription start site of ARID5B, that alleles of rs7090445 have differential enhancer activity and influence RUNX3 binding. RUNX3 knock-down reduces ARID5B expression and rs7090445 enhancer activity. Individuals carrying the rs7090445-C risk allele also have reduced ARID5B expression. Finally, the rs7090445-C risk allele is preferentially retained in HD-ALL blasts consistent with inherited genetic variation contributing to arrest of normal lymphocyte development, facilitating leukaemic clonal expansion. These data provide evidence for a biological mechanism underlying hereditary risk of HD-ALL at 10q21.2.	2018	12	11	Nat Commun	Studd	James B
28381164	10.1177/1010428317697573	Association of ARID5B gene variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children.	Studies have shown an association between ARID5B gene polymorphisms and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the association between ARID5B variants and acute lymphoblastic leukemia among the Arab population still needs to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ARID5B variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children. A total of 14 ARID5B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 289 Yemeni children, of whom 136 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 153 were controls, using the nanofluidic Dynamic Array (Fluidigm 192.24 Dynamic Array). Using logistic regression adjusted for age and gender, the risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We found that nine SNPs were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under additive genetic models: rs7073837, rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10821936, rs4506592, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. Furthermore, the recessive models revealed that six SNPs were risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. The gender-specific impact of these SNPs under the recessive genetic model revealed that SNPs rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs6479779 in females, and rs10821938 and rs7923074 in males were significantly associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk. Under the dominant model, SNPs rs7073837, rs10821936, rs7896246, and rs6479778 in males only showed striking association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The additive model revealed that SNPs with significant association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were rs10821936 (both males and females); rs7073837, rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs4948487 (females only); and rs7089424, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074 (males only). In addition, the ARID5B haplotype block (CGAACACAA) showed a higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The haplotype (CCCGACTGC) was associated with protection against acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In conclusion, our study has shown that ARID5B variants are associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children with several gender biases of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms reported.	2017	04	18	Tumour Biol	Al-Absi	Boshra
28751478	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-0360	Novel Gene and Network Associations Found for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Using Case-Control and Family-Based Studies in Multiethnic Populations.	<b>Background:</b> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, suggesting that germline variants influence ALL risk. Although multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified variants predisposing children to ALL, it remains unclear whether genetic heterogeneity affects ALL susceptibility and how interactions within and among genes containing ALL-associated variants influence ALL risk.<b>Methods:</b> Here, we jointly analyzed two published datasets of case-control GWA summary statistics along with germline data from ALL case-parent trios. We used the gene-level association method PEGASUS to identify genes with multiple variants associated with ALL. We then used PEGASUS gene scores as input to the network analysis algorithm HotNet2 to characterize the genomic architecture of ALL.<b>Results:</b> Using PEGASUS, we confirmed associations previously observed at genes such as <i>ARID5B, IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B</i>, and <i>PIP4K2A</i>, and we identified novel candidate gene associations. Using HotNet2, we uncovered significant gene subnetworks that may underlie inherited ALL risk: a subnetwork involved in B-cell differentiation containing the ALL-associated gene <i>CEBPE</i>, and a subnetwork of homeobox genes, including <i>MEIS1</i><b>Conclusions:</b> Gene and network analysis uncovered loci associated with ALL that are missed by GWA studies, such as <i>MEIS1</i> Furthermore, ALL-associated loci do not appear to interact directly with each other to influence ALL risk, and instead appear to influence leukemogenesis through multiple, complex pathways.<b>Impact:</b> We present a new pipeline for <i>post hoc</i> analysis of association studies that yields new insight into the etiology of ALL and can be applied in future studies to shed light on the genomic underpinnings of cancer. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(10); 1531-9. ©2017 AACR</i>.	2018	05	29	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Nakka	Priyanka
28817678	10.1371/journal.pone.0180488	Family-based exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia among Hispanics confirms role of ARID5B in susceptibility.	We conducted an exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among Hispanics to confirm and identify novel variants associated with disease risk in this population. We used a case-parent trio study design; unlike more commonly used case-control studies, this study design is ideal for avoiding issues with population stratification bias among this at-risk ethnic group. Using 710 individuals from 323 Guatemalan and US Hispanic families, two inherited SNPs in ARID5B reached genome-wide level significance: rs10821936, RR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.70-3.14, p = 1.7×10-8 and rs7089424, RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.64-3.01, p = 5.2×10-8. Similar results were observed when restricting our analyses to those with the B-ALL subtype: ARID5B rs10821936 RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.02, p = 9.63×10-8 and ARID5B rs7089424 RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.57-2.88, p = 2.81×10-7. Notably, effect sizes observed for rs7089424 and rs10821936 in our study were &gt;20% higher than those reported among non-Hispanic white populations in previous genetic association studies. Our results confirmed the role of ARID5B in childhood ALL susceptibility among Hispanics; however, our assessment did not reveal any strong novel inherited genetic risks for acute lymphoblastic leukemia among this ethnic group.	2017	10	18	PLoS One	Archer	Natalie P
28905228	10.1007/s12032-017-1038-7	Genetic susceptibility in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and a leading cause of death due to disease in children. The genetic basis of ALL susceptibility has been supported by its association with certain congenital disorders and, more recently, by several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These GWAS identified common variants in ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, LHPP and ELK3 influencing ALL risk. However, the risk variants of these SNPs were not validated in all populations, suggesting that some of the loci could be population specific. On the other hand, the currently identified risk SNPs in these genes only account for 19% of the additive heritable risk. This estimation indicates that additional susceptibility variants could be discovered. In this review, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in genetic susceptibility of childhood ALL in all GWAS and subsequent studies and we will also point to future directions that could be explored in the near future.	2018	05	09	Med Oncol	Gutierrez-Camino	Angela
29326336	10.1101/gad.302646.117	ARID5B as a critical downstream target of the TAL1 complex that activates the oncogenic transcriptional program and promotes T-cell leukemogenesis.	The oncogenic transcription factor <i>TAL1/SCL</i> induces an aberrant transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. However, the critical factors that are directly activated by TAL1 and contribute to T-ALL pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identified <i>AT-rich interactive domain 5B</i> (<i>ARID5B</i>) as a collaborating oncogenic factor involved in the transcriptional program in T-ALL. <i>ARID5B</i> expression is down-regulated at the double-negative 2-4 stages in normal thymocytes, while it is induced by the TAL1 complex in human T-ALL cells. The enhancer located 135 kb upstream of the <i>ARID5B</i> gene locus is activated under a superenhancer in T-ALL cells but not in normal T cells. Notably, ARID5B-bound regions are associated predominantly with active transcription. ARID5B and TAL1 frequently co-occupy target genes and coordinately control their expression. ARID5B positively regulates the expression of TAL1 and its regulatory partners. ARID5B also activates the expression of the oncogene <i>MYC</i> Importantly, ARID5B is required for the survival and growth of T-ALL cells<i>,</i> and forced expression of ARID5B in immature thymocytes results in thymus retention, differentiation arrest, radioresistance, and tumor formation in zebrafish. Our results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and <i>MYC</i> in T-ALL, thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.	2018	02	08	Genes Dev	Leong	Wei Zhong
26941364	10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0528	Pathway Analysis of Genome-wide Association Study in Childhood Leukemia among Hispanics.	The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is nearly 20% higher among Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites. Previous studies have shown evidence for association between risk of ALL and variation within IKZF1, ARID5B, CEBPE, CDKN2A, GATA3, and BM1-PIP4K2A genes. However, variants identified only account for &lt;10% of the genetic risk of ALL. We applied pathway-based analyses to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biologic pathways were overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among SNPs. Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may involve distinct biologic mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and focal adhesion (PFDR &lt; 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell malignancies. Several candidate genes for ALL, such as COL6A6 and COL5A1, were identified through targeted maximum likelihood estimation. This is the first study to show distinct biologic pathways are overrepresented in different ALL subtypes using pathway-based approaches, and identified potential gene candidates using causal inference methods. The findings demonstrate that newly developed bioinformatics tools and causal inference methods can provide insights to furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia.

27184773	10.3109/08880018.2016.1161685	Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, CDKN2A, and CEBPE with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Tunisian children and their contribution to racial differences in leukemia incidence.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focusing on pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2), CDKN2A (9p21.3), and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly associated to the risk of developing pediatric ALL. These studies have been conducted in European and Thai populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of pediatric ALL. In order to explore the impact of these variants on pediatric ALL risk in the Tunisian population, we genotyped 58 cases of pediatric ALL and 150 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs7089424 (10q21.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Our results, which are consistent with findings in European populations, show that 3 SNPs, i.e., rs4132601 (P = .00116, odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.42, 5.87]), rs7089424 (P = .0022, OR = 0.49, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.79]), and rs2239633 (P = .0010, OR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.75]) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing pediatric ALL (P &lt; .05). Furthermore, we show differences in allele frequencies in SNPs between Tunisian and Caucasian and/or Thai populations (e.g., CEBPE, rs2239633; population attributable risk [PAR] ∼15-fold the PAR of Thai population). These differences, combined with differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between populations and differences in size between populations, may contribute to racial differences in pediatric ALL incidence. 	2017	04	07	Pediatr Hematol Oncol	Gharbi	Hanene
27644650		Association of Genetic Variants in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with Risk of Childhood de novo B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in India.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous genetic disease and its etiology remains poorly understood. Recent genome wide association and replication studies have highlighted specic polymorphisms contributing to childhood ALL predispositions mostly in European populations. It is unclear if these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of ALL. The current case-control study evaluated variants in ARID5B (rs7089424, rs10821936), IKZF1 (rs4132601) and CEBPE (rs2239633) genes, which appear most significantly associated with risk of developing childhood B-lineage ALL. Using TaqMan assays, genotyping was conducted for 162 de novo B-lineage ALL cases and 150 unrelated healthy controls in India. Appropriate statistical methods were applied. Genotypic and allelic frequencies differed significantly between cases and controls at IKZF1-rs4132601 (p=0.039, p=0.015) and ARID5B-rs10821936 (p=0.028, p=0.026). Both rs10821936 (p=0.019; OR 0.67; 95% CI=0.47-0.94) and rs4132601 (p=0.018; OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.48-0.94) were associated with reduced disease risk. Moreover, gender- analysis revealed male-specific risk associations for rs10821936 (p=0.041 CT+CC) and rs4132601 (p=0.005 G allele). Further, ARID5B-rs7089424 and CEBPE-rs2239633 showed a trend towards decreased disease risk but without significance (p=0.073; p=0.73). Our findings provide the rst evidence that SNPs ARID5B- rs10821936 and IKZF1-rs4132601 are associated with decreased B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Indian children. Understanding the effects of these variants in different ethnic groups is crucial as they may confer different risk of ALL within different populations.	2017	02	02	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Bhandari	Prerana
28476190	10.1016/j.arcmed.2016.12.003	ARID5B, CEBPE and PIP4K2A Germline Genetic Polymorphisms and Risk of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Mexican Patients: A MIGICCL Study.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of childhood cancer-related deaths worldwide. Multiples studies have shown that ALL seems to be originated by an interaction between environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. The ARID5B polymorphisms are among the most reproducible ALL associated-risk alleles in different populations. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of ARID5B, CEBPE, and PIP4K2 risk alleles for the development of ALL in children from Mexico City and Yucatan, Mexico. A study was conducted with a total of 761 unrelated subjects. Two hundred eighty five ALL cases (111 from Yucatan and 174 from Mexico City) and 476 healthy subjects. Genotyping included the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A), rs10821936 (ARID5B), rs7089424 (ARID5B) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms. Associations between ALL and rs10821936 and rs7089424 ARID5B SNPs were found (OR = 1.9, 95% CI (1.5-2.4) and OR = 2.0, 95% CI (1.6-2.5), respectively). Moreover, a higher risk was observed in the homozygous risk genotypes of carriers from Mexico City (OR = 3.1, 95% CI (2.0-4.9) and OR 3.1, CI 95% (2.0-4.8), respectively). Otherwise, the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms were not associated with ALL risk. Our analysis suggests that ARID5B confers risk for childhood ALL in a Mexican population.	2017	07	06	Arch Med Res	Bekker-Méndez	Vilma Carolina
24707947	10.3109/10428194.2014.910662	Genetic markers in a multi-ethnic sample for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk.	Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple risk loci for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but mostly in European/White populations, despite Hispanics having a greater risk. We re-examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of known associations with childhood ALL and known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region lymphoma risk markers in a multi-ethnic population. Significant associations were found in two ARID5B variants (rs7089424 and rs10821936). We replicated a strong risk association in non-Hispanic White males with rs2395185, a protective marker for lymphoma. Another HLA region marker, rs2647012, showed a risk association among Hispanics only, while a strong protective association was found with rs1048456, a follicular lymphoma risk marker. Our study validated this new case-control sample by confirming genetic markers associated with childhood ALL, and yielded new associations with lymphoma markers. Despite positive results, our study did not provide any clues as to why Hispanics have a higher susceptibility to childhood leukemia, suggesting that environmental factors may have a strong contribution.	2015	10	07	Leuk Lymphoma	Kennedy	Amy E

25150625	10.1016/j.bcmd.2014.07.011	Concordant B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in non-twinned siblings.	Associating the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with genetic predisposition is still a challenge. Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1 usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53, and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found in the parents. Altogether, our data suggest that genetic predisposition aligned with chance haa an additive effect in BCP-ALL outcome.	2015	07	29	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Pombo-de-Oliveira	Maria S
25761407	10.1007/s10552-015-0550-3	Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and surrogates for early-life infections with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanic children.	Genome-wide association studies focusing on European-ancestry populations have identified ALL risk loci on IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. To capture the impacts of these genes on ALL risk in the California Hispanic population, we comprehensively assessed the variation within the genes and further assessed the joint effects between the genetic variation and surrogates for early-life infections (the presence of older siblings, daycare attendance, and ear infections). Genotypic data for 323 Hispanic ALL cases and 454 controls from the California Childhood Leukemia Study were generated using Illumina OmniExpress v1 platform. Logistic regression assuming a log-additive model estimated odds ratios (OR) associated with each SNP, adjusted for age, sex, and the first five principal components. In addition, we examined potential interactions between six ALL risk alleles and surrogates for early-life infections using logistic regression models that included an interaction term. Significant associations between genotypes at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and ALL risk were identified: rs7780012, OR 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.71 (p = 0.004); rs7089424, OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.65 (p = 1.16 × 10(-9)); rs4982731, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.37-2.08 (p = 2.35 × 10(-6)), respectively. Evidence for multiplicative interactions between genetic variants and surrogates for early-life infections with ALL risk was not observed. Consistent with findings in non-Hispanic White population, our study showed that variants within IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE were associated with increased ALL risk, and the effects for ARID5B and CEBPE were most prominent in the high-hyperdiploid ALL subtype in the California Hispanic population. Results implicate the ARID5B, CEBPE, and IKZF1 genes in the pathogenesis of childhood ALL.	2016	03	21	Cancer Causes Control	Hsu	Ling-I
25806972	10.1371/journal.pone.0121348	ARID5B, IKZF1 and non-genetic factors in the etiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: the ESCALE study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified that frequent polymorphisms in ARID5B and IKZF1, two genes involved in lymphoid differentiation, increase the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These findings markedly modified the current field of research on the etiology of ALL. In this new context, the present exploratory study investigated the possible interactions between these at-risk alleles and the non-genetic suspected ALL risk factors that were of sufficient prevalence in the French ESCALE study: maternal use of home insecticides during pregnancy, preconception paternal smoking, and some proxies for early immune modulation, i.e. breastfeeding, history of common infections before age one year, and birth order. The analyses were based on 434 ALL cases and 442 controls of European origin, drawn from the nationwide population-based case-control study ESCALE. Information on non-genetic factors was obtained by standardized telephone interview. Interactions between rs10740055 in ARID5B or rs4132601 in IKZF1 and each of the suspected non-genetic factors were tested, with the SNPs coded as counts of minor alleles (trend variable). Statistical interactions were observed between rs4132601 and maternal insecticide use (p = 0.012), breastfeeding p = 0.017) and repeated early common infections (p = 0.0070), with allelic odds ratios (OR) which were only increased among the children not exposed to insecticides (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.4), those who had been breastfed (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.5) and those who had had repeated early common infections (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.5, 3.8). The allelic ORs were close to one among children exposed to insecticides, who had not been breastfed and who had had no or few common infections. Repeated early common infections interacted with rs10740055 (p = 0.018) in the case-only design. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these observations of a modification of the effect of the at-risk alleles by non-genetic factors are chance findings or reflect true underlying mechanisms. 	2016	02	17	PLoS One	Rudant	Jérémie
26104880	10.1038/ncomms8553	Inherited coding variants at the CDKN2A locus influence susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children.	There is increasing evidence from genome-wide association studies for a strong inherited genetic basis of susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, yet the effects of protein-coding variants on ALL risk have not been systematically evaluated. Here we show a missense variant in CDKN2A associated with the development of ALL at genome-wide significance (rs3731249, P=9.4 × 10(-23), odds ratio=2.23). Functional studies indicate that this hypomorphic variant results in reduced tumour suppressor function of p16(INK4A), increases the susceptibility to leukaemic transformation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, and is preferentially retained in ALL tumour cells. Resequencing the CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus in 2,407 childhood ALL cases reveals 19 additional putative functional germline variants. These results provide direct functional evidence for the influence of inherited genetic variation on ALL risk, highlighting the important and complex roles of CDKN2A-CDKN2B tumour suppressors in leukaemogenesis. 	2016	04	05	Nat Commun	Xu	Heng
26575185	10.1371/journal.pone.0143343	Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test Using ddPCR (SMART-ddPCR): An Accurate Method for Assessment of Preferential Allelic Imbalance in Tumor DNA.	The extent to which heritable genetic variants can affect tumor development has yet to be fully elucidated. Tumor selection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles, a phenomenon called preferential allelic imbalance (PAI), has been demonstrated in some cancer types. We developed a novel application of digital PCR termed Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test using Droplet Digital PCR (SMART-ddPCR) for accurate assessment of tumor PAI, and have applied this method to test the hypothesis that heritable SNPs associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may demonstrate tumor PAI. These SNPs are located at CDKN2A (rs3731217) and IKZF1 (rs4132601), genes frequently lost in ALL, and at CEBPE (rs2239633), ARID5B (rs7089424), PIP4K2A (rs10764338), and GATA3 (rs3824662), genes located on chromosomes gained in high-hyperdiploid ALL. We established thresholds of AI using constitutional DNA from SNP heterozygotes, and subsequently measured allelic copy number in tumor DNA from 19-142 heterozygote samples per SNP locus. We did not find significant tumor PAI at these loci, though CDKN2A and IKZF1 SNPs showed a trend towards preferential selection of the risk allele (p = 0.17 and p = 0.23, respectively). Using a genomic copy number control ddPCR assay, we investigated somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) underlying AI at CDKN2A and IKZF1, revealing a complex range of alterations including homozygous and hemizygous deletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, with varying degrees of clonality. Copy number estimates from ddPCR showed high agreement with those from multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assays. We demonstrate that SMART-ddPCR is a highly accurate method for investigation of tumor PAI and for assessment of the somatic alterations underlying AI. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified 16 recurrent SCNA loci that contain heritable cancer risk SNPs associated with a matching tumor type, and which represent candidate PAI regions warranting further investigation. 	2016	06	28	PLoS One	de Smith	Adam J
23975371	10.1007/s13277-013-1097-0	ARID5B gene rs10821936 polymorphism is associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis based on 39,116 subjects.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children. Two recent genome-wide association studies and several replicated studies have provided convincing evidence that inherited genetic variation in ARID5B contributes to childhood ALL predisposition. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the association between ARID5B genetic polymorphism and the risk for ALL. We conducted a search of case-control studies on the association of ARID5B genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to ALL in PubMed, EMBASE, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data from eligible studies were extracted for meta-analysis. ALL risk associated with ARID5B genetic polymorphism was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Nine articles including 13 case-control studies were included in the present meta-analysis. We found that rs10821936 polymorphism in ARID5B gene was associated with increased risk for ALL (P &lt; 0.0001; OR = 1.27; 95%CI, 1.17-1.37). This meta-analysis suggests that ARID5B genetic polymorphism was associated with the increased risk of ALL.	2014	03	26	Tumour Biol	Guo	Lei-Ming
24200646	10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.10.003	High-resolution melting analyses for genetic variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility loci in Taiwan.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a heterogeneous disease that includes multiple subtypes is defined by cell lineage and chromosome anomalies. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several ARID5B and IKZF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of ALL. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and convenient technique to detect SNPs; we thereby detected SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We enrolled 79 pediatric ALL patients and 80 healthy controls. Polymorphic variants of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs7073837, rs10740055, and rs7089424) were detected by HRM, and SNPs were analyzed for association with childhood ALL. The distribution of genotype rs7073837 in ARID5B significantly differed between ALL and controls (P=0.046), while those of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs10740055 and rs7089424) did not. We analyzed the association for SNPs with B lineage ALL to find rs7073837 in ARID5B, conferring a higher risk for B lineage ALL (odds ratio, OR=1.70, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.01-2.87, P=0.049). HRM is a practical method to detect SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We found that rs7073837 in ARID5B correlated with a risk for childhood B lineage ALL.	2014	08	13	Blood Cells Mol Dis	Lin	Chien-Yu

24712521	10.1111/bjh.12886	Associations of novel genetic variations in the folate-related and ARID5B genes with the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of high-dose methotrexate in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.	High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) plays an important role in the consolidation therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in many treatment regimens worldwide. However, there is a large interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the drug. We investigated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the folate metabolic pathway, transporter molecules and transcription proteins on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of MTX and 7-hydroxy-methotrexate (7-OH-MTX). 63 SNPs of 14 genes were genotyped and a total of 463 HD-MTX courses (administered according to the ALL-BFM 95 and ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocols) were analysed. Haematological, hepatic and renal toxicities, estimated by routine laboratory parameters were evaluated. Random forest and regression trees were used for variable selection and model building. Linear mixed models were established to prove the significance of the selected variables. SNPs (rs4948502, rs4948496, rs4948487) of the ARID5B gene were associated with the serum levels of MTX (P &lt; 0·02), serum levels and area under the curve of 7-OH-MTX (P &lt; 0·02) and with hypoproteinaemia (P = 0·004). SLCO1B1 rs4149056 also showed a significant association with serum MTX levels (P &lt; 0·001). Our findings confirm the association of novel genetic variations in folate-related and ARID5B genes with the serum MTX levels and acute toxicity.	2014	10	09	Br J Haematol	Csordas	Katalin
24753091	10.1002/ajh.23727	Genomic ancestry and somatic alterations correlate with age at diagnosis in Hispanic children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Hispanic children have a higher incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than non-Hispanic whites but tend to be diagnosed at older ages. In genome-wide association studies, Native American ancestry and polymorphisms in six genes have been associated with ALL risk. In multivariable regression models, we investigated whether genomic ancestry, inherited risk SNPs, or acquired somatic alterations were associated with differences in age at diagnosis in Hispanic children with B-cell ALL. Genome-wide array data were used to estimate each participant's percent membership in the three Hispanic ancestral populations: Native American, African, and European. Each 20% increase in European ancestry was associated with a six month younger age at diagnosis (95% CI = 0.36-11.6 months, P = 0.037). Correspondingly, each 20% increase in Native American ancestry was associated with a six-month older age at diagnosis (P = 0.037). Both the TEL-AML1 translocation and high-hyperdiploidy were associated with younger age at diagnosis (24.4 months, P = 2.0 x 10(-4) and 12.4 months, P = 0.011, respectively), while CDKN2A and IKZF1 deletions were associated with older age at diagnosis (19.7 months, P = 7.0 x 10(-4) and 18.1 months, P = 0.012, respectively). No associations with age at diagnosis were observed for RAS mutation, PAX5 deletion or for known heritable risk alleles in IKZF1, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, GATA3, ARID5B, or CEBPE. Because younger age at diagnosis is associated with improved treatment outcomes for children with ALL, the effect of European ancestry on ALL survival may be mediated by its effect on age at diagnosis, or by proxy, its association with more treatable molecular subtypes of ALL.	2014	10	09	Am J Hematol	Walsh	Kyle M
25096228	10.1159/000363660	A new system identification approach to identify genetic variants in sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.	We propose in this paper a set-valued (SV) system model, which is a generalized form of logistic (LG) and Probit (Probit) regression, to be considered as a method for discovering genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants in next-generation sequencing studies, for a binary phenotype. We propose a new SV system identification method to estimate all underlying key system parameters for the Probit model and compare it with the LG model in the setting of genetic association studies. Across an extensive series of simulation studies, the Probit method maintained type I error control and had similar or greater power than the LG method, which is robust to different distributions of noise: logistic, normal, or t distributions. Additionally, the Probit association parameter estimate was 2.7-46.8-fold less variable than the LG log-odds ratio association parameter estimate. Less variability in the association parameter estimate translates to greater power and robustness across the spectrum of minor allele frequencies (MAFs), and these advantages are the most pronounced for rare variants. For instance, in a simulation that generated data from an additive logistic model with an odds ratio of 7.4 for a rare single nucleotide polymorphism with a MAF of 0.005 and a sample size of 2,300, the Probit method had 60% power whereas the LG method had 25% power at the α = 10(-6) level. Consistent with these simulation results, the set of variants identified by the LG method was a subset of those identified by the Probit method in two example analyses. Thus, we suggest the Probit method may be a competitive alternative to the LG method in genetic association studies such as candidate gene, genome-wide, or next-generation sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.	2015	04	23	Hum Hered	Kang	Guolian
25124600	10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.15.6211	Associations between AT-rich interactive domain 5B gene polymorphisms and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, replicated studies reported some inconsistent results in different populations. Using meta-analysis, we here aimed to clarify the nature of the genetic risks contributed by the two polymorphisms (rs10994982, rs7089424) for developing childhood ALL. Through searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and manually searching relevant references, a total of 14 articles with 16 independent studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to assess the associations. Both SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 showed significant associations with childhood ALL risk in all genetic models after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, subtype analyses of B-lineage ALL provided strong evidence that SNP rs10994982 is highly associated with the risk of developing B-hyperdiploid ALL. These results indicate that SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 are indeed significantly associated with increased risk of childhood ALL. 	2017	01	24	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Zeng	Hui

25310577	10.1371/journal.pone.0110255	Confirmation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia variants, ARID5B and IKZF1, and interaction with parental environmental exposures.	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have established association of ARID5B and IKZF1 variants with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors alone appear to make a relatively minor contribution to disease risk. The polygenic nature of childhood ALL predisposition together with the timing of environmental triggers may hold vital clues for disease etiology. This study presents results from an Australian GWAS of childhood ALL cases (n = 358) and population controls (n = 1192). Furthermore, we utilised family trio (n = 204) genotypes to extend our investigation to gene-environment interaction of significant loci with parental exposures before conception, and child's sex and age. Thirteen SNPs achieved genome wide significance in the population based case/control analysis; ten annotated to ARID5B and three to IKZF1. The most significant SNPs in these regions were ARID5B rs4245595 (OR 1.63, CI 1.38-1.93, P = 2.13×10(-9)), and IKZF1 rs1110701 (OR 1.69, CI 1.42-2.02, p = 7.26×10(-9)). There was evidence of gene-environment interaction for risk genotype at IKZF1, whereby an apparently stronger genetic effect was observed if the mother took folic acid or if the father did not smoke prior to pregnancy (respective interaction P-values: 0.04, 0.05). There were no interactions of risk genotypes with age or sex (P-values &gt;0.2). Our results evidence that interaction of genetic variants and environmental exposures may further alter risk of childhood ALL however, investigation in a larger population is required. If interaction of folic acid supplementation and IKZF1 variants holds, it may be useful to quantify folate levels prior to initiating use of folic acid supplements.	2015	09	17	PLoS One	Evans	Tiffany-Jane
22422485	10.1002/pbc.24131	Genetic variants modify susceptibility to leukemia in infants: a Children's Oncology Group report.	The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is commonly rearranged in infant leukemia (IL). Genetic determinants of susceptibility to IL are unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have identified susceptibility loci at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. We genotyped these loci in 171 infants with leukemia and 384 controls and evaluated associations overall, by subtype [ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)], and by presence (+) or absence (-) of MLL rearrangements. Homozygosity for a variant IKZF1 allele (rs11978267) increased risk of infant AML [Odds ratio (OR) = 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-8.4]; the increased risk was similar for AML/MLL+ and MLL- cases. In contrast, risk of ALL/MLL- was increased in infants homozygous for the IKZF1 variant (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.8-14.5) but the variant did not modify risk of ALL/MLL+. For ARID5B (rs10821936), homozygosity for the variant allele increased risk for the ALL/MLL- subgroup only (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 2.5-20.6). There was little evidence of an association with the CEBP variant (rs2239633). IKZF1 is expressed in early hematopoiesis, including precursor myeloid cells. Our data provide the first evidence that IKZF1 modifies susceptibility to infant AML, irrespective of MLL rearrangements, and could provide important new etiologic insights into this rare and heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy.	2013	03	07	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Ross	Julie A
23382691	10.1371/journal.pgen.1003225	Loci associated with N-glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G show pleiotropy with autoimmune diseases and haematological cancers.	Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247 individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of 1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P&lt;2.27 × 10(-9)) in the discovery analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation of a single plasma protein using GWAS. The results may also provide an explanation for the reported pleiotropy and antagonistic effects of loci involved in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.	2013	05	30	PLoS Genet	Lauc	Gordan
23512250	10.1093/jnci/djt042	Novel susceptibility variants at 10p12.31-12.2 for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in ethnically diverse populations.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and the incidence of ALL varies by ethnicity. Although accumulating evidence indicates inherited predisposition to ALL, the genetic basis of ALL susceptibility in diverse ancestry has not been comprehensively examined. We performed a multiethnic genome-wide association study in 1605 children with ALL and 6661 control subjects after adjusting for population structure, with validation in three replication series of 845 case subjects and 4316 control subjects. Association was tested by two-sided logistic regression. A novel ALL susceptibility locus at 10p12.31-12.2 (BMI1-PIP4K2A, rs7088318, P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) was identified in the genome-wide association study, with independent replication in European Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans (P = .001, .009, and .04, respectively). Association was also validated at four known ALL susceptibility loci: ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and CDKN2A/2B. Associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants were consistent across ethnicity, with multiple independent signals at IKZF1 and BMI1-PIP4K2A loci. The frequency of ARID5B and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants differed by ethnicity, in parallel with ethnic differences in ALL incidence. Suggestive evidence for modifying effects of age on genetic predisposition to ALL was also observed. ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants cumulatively conferred strong predisposition to ALL, with children carrying six to eight copies of risk alleles at a ninefold (95% confidence interval = 6.9 to 11.8) higher ALL risk relative to those carrying zero to one risk allele at these four single nucleotide polymorphisms. These findings indicate strong associations between inherited genetic variation and ALL susceptibility in children and shed new light on ALL molecular etiology in diverse ancestry.	2013	07	08	J Natl Cancer Inst	Xu	Heng
23608171	10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.028	Association of three polymorphisms in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a Chinese population.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focus on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than 15 years old, have found evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2) and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly related to the risk of childhood ALL. These polymorphisms may lead to abnormal expression and dysfunction of the corresponding transcription factors and are likely to increase the risk of ALL. To validate the relationship between these SNPs and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL cases and 673 controls. We determined that the SNP rs10821936 in ARID5B was statistically significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL (P&lt;0.0001). The results were also significant for the subgroup analysis of high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk ALL as well as B-lineage ALL. Statistically significant differences were not found in the SNPs for IKZF1 and CEBPE. In conclusion, ARID5B rs10821936 could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese children.	2013	08	05	Gene	Wang	Yaping

Interactions between common germline variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 and other known childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk factors were queried using biospecimens and data from 770 ALL cases and 384 controls. Case-control comparisons revealed dose-dependent associations between ARID5B rs10821936, ARID5B rs10994982, and IKZF1 rs11978267 and childhood ALL overall, and B lineage and B lineage hyperdiploid ALL examined separately (all allelic odds ratios ≥1.33, Ptrend≤0.001). No heterogeneity was observed between ORs for males and females (all Pinteraction≥0.48). Likewise, no significant genotype-birth weight interactions were detected (all Pinteraction≥0.12) among cases. These results indicate similar ALL risk across strata of known risk factors. 	2013	09	17	Leuk Res	Linabery	Amy M
23836053	10.1007/s10552-013-0256-3	Genetic variants in ARID5B and CEBPE are childhood ALL susceptibility loci in Hispanics.	Recent genome-wide studies conducted in European Whites have identified novel susceptibility genes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to examine whether these loci are susceptibility genes among Hispanics, whose reported incidence of childhood ALL is the highest of all ethnic groups in California, and whether their effects differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). We genotyped 13 variants in these genes among 706 Hispanic (300 cases, 406 controls) and 594 NHW (225 cases, 369 controls) participants in a matched population-based case-control study in California. We found significant associations for the five studied ARID5B variants in both Hispanics (p values of 1.0 × 10(-9) to 0.004) and NHWs (p values of 2.2 × 10(-6) to 0.018). Risk estimates were in the same direction in both groups (ORs of 1.53-1.99 and 1.37-1.84, respectively) and strengthened when restricted to B-cell precursor high-hyperdiploid ALL (&gt;50 chromosomes; ORs of 2.21-3.22 and 1.67-2.71, respectively). Similar results were observed for the single CEBPE variant. Hispanics and NHWs exhibited different susceptibility loci at CDKN2A. Although IKZF1 loci showed significant susceptibility effects among NHWs (p &lt; 1 × 10(-5)), their effects among Hispanics were in the same direction but nonsignificant, despite similar minor allele frequencies. Future studies should examine whether the observed effects vary by environmental, immunological, or lifestyle factors.	2014	06	11	Cancer Causes Control	Chokkalingam	Anand P
23996088	10.1182/blood-2013-03-491316	Variation at 10p12.2 and 10p14 influences risk of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and phenotype.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer diagnosed in economically developed countries with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, accounting for approximately 70% of ALL. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided the first unambiguous evidence for common inherited susceptibility to BCP-ALL, identifying susceptibility loci at 7p12.2, 9p21.3, 10q21.2, and 14q11.2. To identify additional BCP-ALL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1658 cases and 4723 controls, with validation in 1449 cases and 1488 controls. Combined analysis identified novel loci mapping to 10p12.2 (rs10828317, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; P = 2.30 × 10(-9)) and 10p14 marked by rs3824662 (OR = 1.31; P = 8.62 × 10(-12)). The single nucleotide polymorphism rs10828317 is responsible for the N215S polymorphism in exon 7 of PIP4K2A, and rs3824662 localizes to intron 3 of the transcription factor and putative tumor suppressor gene GATA3. The rs10828317 association was shown to be specifically associated with hyperdiploid ALL, whereas the rs3824662-associated risk was confined to nonhyperdiploid non-TEL-AML1 + ALL. The risk allele of rs3824662 was correlated with older age at diagnosis (P &lt; .001) and significantly worse event-free survivorship (P &lt; .0001). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to BCP-ALL and the influence of constitutional genotype on disease development. 	2014	01	07	Blood	Migliorini	Gabriele
24013273	10.1007/s00432-013-1512-3	Intron 3 of the ARID5B gene: a hot spot for acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility.	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AT-rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) have been associated with risk for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After reviewing previous studies, we realized that the most significant associations were restricted to intron 3, but the mechanism(s) by which those SNPs affect ALL risk remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the association between genetic variants of the intron 3 region of ARID5B and the incidence of B-ALL in a Spanish population. We also aimed to find a functional explanation for the association, searching for copy number variations (CNVs), and changes in ARID5B expression associated with the genotypes of the SNPs. We analyzed 10 SNPs in intron 3 of ARID5B in a Spanish population of 219 B-ALL patients and 397 unrelated controls with the Taqman Open Array platform. CNVs were analyzed in 23 patients and 17 controls using the Cytogenetics Whole-genome 2.7 M platform. Expression of ARID5B transcript 1 was quantified by qPCR and related to SNPs genotype in seven ALL cell lines. Association between intron 3 and B-ALL risk was confirmed for all of the SNPs evaluated in our Spanish population. We could not explain this association by the presence of CNVs. We neither detected changes in the expression of ARID5B isoform associated with the genotype of the SNPs. The intron 3 of ARID5B gene was found to be strongly associated with B-ALL risk in the Spanish population examined. However, neither CNVs nor changes in mRNA expression were found to be responsible for this association.	2013	12	16	J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	Gutiérrez-Camino	Ángela
22076464	10.1038/leu.2011.302	Identification of germline susceptibility loci in ETV6-RUNX1-rearranged childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease of the white blood cells. The etiology of ALL is believed to be multifactorial and likely to involve an interplay of environmental and genetic variables. We performed a genome-wide association study of 355 750 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 474 controls and 419 childhood ALL cases characterized by a t(12;21)(p13;q22) - the most common chromosomal translocation observed in childhood ALL - which leads to an ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The eight most strongly associated SNPs were followed-up in 951 ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases and 3061 controls from Germany/Austria and Italy, respectively. We identified a novel, genome-wide significant risk locus at 3q28 (TP63, rs17505102, P(CMH)=8.94 × 10(-9), OR=0.65). The separate analysis of the combined German/Austrian sample only, revealed additional genome-wide significant associations at 11q11 (OR8U8, rs1945213, P=9.14 × 10(-11), OR=0.69) and 8p21.3 (near INTS10, rs920590, P=6.12 × 10(-9), OR=1.36). These associations and another association at 11p11.2 (PTPRJ, rs3942852, P=4.95 × 10(-7), OR=0.72) remained significant in the German/Austrian replication panel after correction for multiple testing. Our findings demonstrate that germline genetic variation can specifically contribute to the risk of ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood ALL. The identification of TP63 and PTPRJ as susceptibility genes emphasize the role of the TP53 gene family and the importance of proteins regulating cellular processes in connection with tumorigenesis.	2012	07	05	Leukemia	Ellinghaus	E
22291082	10.1200/JCO.2011.38.0345	ARID5B genetic polymorphisms contribute to racial disparities in the incidence and treatment outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Recent genome-wide screens have identified genetic variations in ARID5B associated with susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to determine the contribution of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to racial disparities in ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome. We compared the association between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL susceptibility in whites (&gt; 95% European genetic ancestry; 978 cases and 1,046 controls) versus in Hispanics (&gt; 10% Native American ancestry; 330 cases and 541 controls). We determined the relationships between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL relapse risk in 1,605 children treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9904/9905 clinical trials. Among 49 ARID5B SNPs interrogated, 10 were significantly associated with ALL susceptibility in both whites and Hispanics (P &lt; .05), with risk alleles consistently more frequent in Hispanics than in whites. rs10821936 exhibited the most significant association in both races (P = 8.4 × 10(-20) in whites; P = 1 × 10(-6) in Hispanics), and genotype at this SNP was highly correlated with local Native American genetic ancestry (P = 1.8 × 10(-8)). Multivariate analyses in Hispanics identified an additional SNP associated with ALL susceptibility independent of rs10821936. Eight ARID5B SNPs were associated with both ALL susceptibility and relapse hazard; the alleles related to higher ALL incidence were always linked to poorer treatment outcome and were more frequent in Hispanics. ARID5B polymorphisms are important determinants of childhood ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome, and they contribute to racial disparities in this disease.	2012	06	08	J Clin Oncol	Xu	Heng

23021489	10.1186/1755-8794-5-42	Candidate gene association study in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia evaluated by Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance.	We carried out a candidate gene association study in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to identify possible genetic risk factors in a Hungarian population. The results were evaluated with traditional statistical methods and with our newly developed Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA) method. We collected genomic DNA and clinical data from 543 children, who underwent chemotherapy due to ALL, and 529 healthy controls. Altogether 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 candidate genes were genotyped. With logistic regression, we identified 6 SNPs in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes associated with increased risk to B-cell ALL, and two SNPs in the STAT3 gene, which decreased the risk to hyperdiploid ALL. Because the associated SNPs were in linkage in each gene, these associations corresponded to one signal per gene. The odds ratio (OR) associated with the tag SNPs were: OR = 1.69, P = 2.22x10(-7) for rs4132601 (IKZF1), OR = 1.53, P = 1.95x10(-5) for rs10821936 (ARID5B) and OR = 0.64, P = 2.32x10(-4) for rs12949918 (STAT3). With the BN-BMLA we confirmed the findings of the frequentist-based method and received additional information about the nature of the relations between the SNPs and the disease. E.g. the rs10821936 in ARID5B and rs17405722 in STAT3 showed a weak interaction, and in case of T-cell lineage sample group, the gender showed a weak interaction with three SNPs in three genes. In the hyperdiploid patient group the BN-BMLA detected a strong interaction among SNPs in the NOTCH1, STAT1, STAT3 and BCL2 genes. Evaluating the survival rate of the patients with ALL, the BN-BMLA showed that besides risk groups and subtypes, genetic variations in the BAX and CEBPA genes might also influence the probability of survival of the patients. In the present study we confirmed the roles of genetic variations in ARID5B and IKZF1 in the susceptibility to B-cell ALL. With the newly developed BN-BMLA method several gene-gene, gene-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype connections were revealed. We showed several advantageous features of the new method, and suggested that in gene association studies the BN-BMLA might be a useful supplementary to the traditional frequentist-based statistical method.	2013	03	05	BMC Med Genomics	Lautner-Csorba	Orsolya
23114164		[Research advances on correlation of ARID5B gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia - review].	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer. Although its etiology remains poorly understood, the hypothesis of ALL correlated with a genetic basis was examined through association studies based on candidate genes. Recently, two independent large-scale genome-wide association studies reported that the five single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7073837; rs10821936; rs10994982; rs7089424; rs10740055) in the gene AT rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B) at 10q21.2, were associated with the high incidence risk of C-ALL, especially with hyperdiploid lymphoblastic leukemia. Variations in these single nucleotide polymorphisms influence the risk of specific disease subtypes, and also possess race- and sex-differences in leukemia incidence. Further elucidation of the mechanisms through which ARID5B variants are involved in C-ALL not only has a great diagnostic value, but also a guidance for the clinical therapy, ultimately improving the prognosis of disease. Therefore, the related studies of ARID5B with C-ALL were summarized briefly in this review.	2013	12	05	Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi	Qian	Xi-Feng

Recent studies have shown that SNPs mapping to 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 9p21 (CDKN2A), 10q21.2 (ARID5B), and 14q11.2 (CEBPE) and carrier status for recessively inherited Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS) influence childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk. To examine these relationship, we analysed 398 ALL cases and 731 controls from Poland. Statistically significant association between genotype at 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 10q21.2 (ARID5B) and the NBS associated locus, 8q21.3 (NBN) and ALL risk was found; odds ratios (ORs), 1.34 (P=0.002), 1.33 (P=0.003), and 1325.21 (P=0.0028), respectively. These data provide further insights into the biological basis of ALL highlighting the existence of both common and rare disease susceptibility variants.	2011	12	14	Leuk Res	Pastorczak	Agata

Recent genome-wide association data have implicated genetic variation at 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 10q21.2 (ARIDB5), and 14q11.2 (CEBPE) in the etiology of B-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To verify and further examine the relationship between these variants and ALL risk, we genotyped 1384 cases of precursor B-cell childhood ALL and 1877 controls from Germany and the United Kingdom. The combined data provided statistically significant support for an association between genotype at each of these loci and ALL risk; odds ratios (OR), 1.69 (P = 7.51 x10(-22)), 1.80 (P = 5.90 x 10(-28)), and 1.27 (P = 4.90 x 10(-6)), respectively. Furthermore, the risk of ALL increases with an increasing numbers of variant alleles for the 3 loci (OR(per-allele) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.62; P(trend) = 3.49 x 10(-42)), consistent with a polygenic model of disease susceptibility. These data provide unambiguous evidence for the role of these variants in defining ALL risk underscoring approximately 64% of cases.	2010	04	02	Blood	Prasad	Rashmi B

20189245	10.1016/j.leukres.2010.02.001	Genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Korea.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a case-control study conducted in Korea. Incident childhood ALL cases (n=50) and non-cancer controls (n=50) frequency-matched to cases by age and sex, recruited from three teaching hospitals in Seoul between 2003 and 2008, were genotyped using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 platform. ALL risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age and birth weight. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for adjusting multiple tests. Of these 1 million SNPs, six SNPs in 4 genes (HAO1 rs6140264, EPB41L2 rs9388856, rs9388857, rs1360756, C2orf3 12105972, MAN2A1 rs3776932) were strongly associated with childhood ALL risk (P(dominant)&lt;or=0.0001 and P(trend)&lt;0.006). These SNPs remained significant after FDR adjustment (FDR value &lt;0.2). Our genome-wide association study in Korea children identified a few genetic variations as potential susceptibility markers for ALL, warranting further replication studies among various ethnic groups.	2010	09	30	Leuk Res	Han	Sohee

Although childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer, its etiology remains poorly understood. In an attempt to replicate the findings of 2 recent genome-wide association studies in a French-Canadian cohort, we confirmed the association of 5 SNPs [rs7073837 (P=4.2 x 10(-4)), rs10994982 (P=3.8 x 10(-4)), rs10740055 (P=1.6 x 10(-5)), rs10821936 (P=1.7 x 10(-7)) and rs7089424 (P=3.6 x 10(-7))] in the ARID5B gene with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We also confirmed a selective effect for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with hyperdiploidy and report a putative gender-specific effect of ARID5B SNPs on acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk in males. This study provides a strong rationale for more detailed analysis to identify the causal variants at this locus and to better understand the overall functional contribution of ARID5B to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility.	2012	11	08	Haematologica	Healy	Jasmine

High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common malignancies in children. It is characterized by gain of chromosomes, typically +X, +4, +6, +10, +14, +17, +18, and +21,+21; little is known about additional genetic aberrations. Approximately 20% of the patients relapse; therefore it is clinically important to identify risk-stratifying markers. We used SNP array analysis to investigate a consecutive series of 74 cases of high hyperdiploid ALL. We show that the characteristic chromosomal gains are even more frequent than previously believed, indicating that karyotyping mistakes are common, and that almost 80% of the cases display additional abnormalities detectable by SNP array analysis. Subclonality analysis strongly implied that the numerical aberrations were primary and arose before structural events, suggesting that step-wise evolution of the leukemic clone is common. An association between duplication of 1q and +5 was seen (P = 0.003). Other frequent abnormalities included whole-chromosome uniparental isodisomies (wUPIDs) 9 and 11, gain of 17q not associated with isochromosome formation, extra gain of part of 21q, deletions of ETS variant 6 (ETV6), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CKDN2A) and paired box 5 (PAX5), and PAN3 poly(A) specific ribonuclease subunit homolog (PAN3) microdeletions. Comparison of whole-chromosome and partial UPID9 suggested different pathogenetic outcomes, with the former not involving CDKN2A. Finally, two cases had partial deletions of AT rich interactive domain 5B (ARID5B), indicating that acquired as well as constitutional variants in this locus may be associated with pediatric ALL. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of the genetic landscape of high hyperdiploid childhood ALL, including the heterogeneous pattern of secondary genetic events.	2011	05	12	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Paulsson	Kajsa
19684603	10.1038/ng.432	Germline genomic variants associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Using the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and publicly available genotypes, we identified 18 SNPs whose allele frequency differed significantly(P &lt; 1 x 10(-5)) between pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (n = 317) and non-ALL controls (n = 17,958). Two SNPs in ARID5B not only differed between ALL and non-ALL groups (rs10821936, P = 1.4 x 10(-15), odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; rs10994982, P = 5.7 x 10(-9), OR = 1.62) but also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes (rs10821936, P = 1.62 x 10(-5), OR = 2.17; rs10994982, P = 0.003, OR 1.72). These ARID5B SNPs also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes in an independent validation cohort (n = 124 children with ALL; P = 0.003 and P = 0.0008, OR 2.45 and 2.86, respectively) and were associated with methotrexate accumulation and gene expression pattern in leukemic lymphoblasts. We conclude that germline variants affect susceptibility to, and characteristics of, specific ALL subtypes.	2009	09	28	Nat Genet	Treviño	Lisa R
19684604	10.1038/ng.430	Loci on 7p12.2, 10q21.2 and 14q11.2 are associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	To identify risk variants for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we conducted a genome-wide association study of two case-control series, analyzing the genotypes with respect to 291,423 tagging SNPs in a total of 907 ALL cases and 2,398 controls. We identified risk loci for ALL at 7p12.2 (IKZF1, rs4132601, odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 1.20 x 10(-19)), 10q21.2 (ARID5B, rs7089424, OR = 1.65, P = 6.69 x 10(-19)) and 14q11.2 (CEBPE, rs2239633, OR = 1.34, P = 2.88 x 10(-7)). The 10q21.2 (ARID5B) risk association appears to be selective for the subset of B-cell precursor ALL with hyperdiploidy. These data show that common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing childhood ALL and provide new insight into disease causation of this specific hematological cancer. Notably, all three risk variants map to genes involved in transcriptional regulation and differentiation of B-cell progenitors.	2009	09	28	Nat Genet	Papaemmanuil	Elli

35482846	10.1080/15548627.2022.2071382	Mutations in V-ATPase in follicular lymphoma activate autophagic flux creating a targetable dependency.	The recent discovery of recurrent gene mutations in chaperones or components of the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) in follicular lymphoma (FL) was an unexpected finding. The application of whole exome sequencing and targeted gene re-sequencing has resulted in the identification of mutations in <i>ATP6AP1, ATP6V1B2</i> and <i>VMA21</i> in a combined 30% of FL, together constituting a major novel mutated pathway in this disease. Interestingly, no other human hematological malignancy carries these mutations at more than sporadic occurrences, implicating unique aspects of FL biology requiring these mutations. The mutations in ATP6V1B2 and VMA21 through separate mechanisms impair lysosomal V-ATPase activity resulting in an elevated lysosomal pH. The elevated lysosomal pH impairs protein and peptide hydrolysis and associates with reduced cytoplasmic amino acid concentrations resulting in compensatory activation of autophagic flux. The elevated autophagic flux constitutes a survival dependency for FL cells and can be targeted with inhibitors to ULK1 and multiple recently identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Targeting autophagy alone or in combination with other targeted therapies constitutes a novel therapeutic opportunity for FL patients.	2022	05	31	Autophagy	Wang	Fangyang
26691987	10.1038/ng.3473	Recurrent mTORC1-activating RRAGC mutations in follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma is an incurable B cell malignancy characterized by the t(14;18) translocation and mutations affecting the epigenome. Although frequent gene mutations in key signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NOTCH and NF-κB, have also been defined, the spectrum of these mutations typically overlaps with that in the closely related diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Using a combination of discovery exome and extended targeted sequencing, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in RRAGC uniquely enriched in patients with follicular lymphoma (17%). More than half of the mutations preferentially co-occurred with mutations in ATP6V1B2 and ATP6AP1, which encode components of the vacuolar H(+)-ATP ATPase (V-ATPase) known to be necessary for amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. The RagC variants increased raptor binding while rendering mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. The activating nature of the RRAGC mutations, their existence in the dominant clone and their stability during disease progression support their potential as an excellent candidate for therapeutic targeting. 	2016	06	03	Nat Genet	Okosun	Jessica
25713363	10.1073/pnas.1501199112	Mutations in early follicular lymphoma progenitors are associated with suppressed antigen presentation.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is incurable with conventional therapies and has a clinical course typified by multiple relapses after therapy. These tumors are genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96% of FL tumors and two or more in 76% of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased antigen presentation. 	2015	05	11	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Green	Michael R
30720463	10.1172/JCI98288	Follicular lymphoma-associated mutations in vacuolar ATPase ATP6V1B2 activate autophagic flux and mTOR.	The discovery of recurrent mutations in subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase (v-ATPase) in follicular lymphoma (FL) highlights a role for the amino acid- and energy-sensing pathway to mTOR in the pathogenesis of this disease. Here, through the use of complementary experimental approaches involving mammalian cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have demonstrated that mutations in the human v-ATPase subunit ATP6V1B2 (also known as Vma2 in yeast) activate autophagic flux and maintain mTOR/TOR in an active state. Engineered lymphoma cell lines and primary FL B cells carrying mutated ATP6V1B2 demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive low leucine concentrations. The treatment of primary FL B cells with inhibitors of autophagy uncovered an addiction for survival for FL B cells harboring ATP6V1B2 mutations. These data support the idea of mutational activation of autophagic flux by recurrent hotspot mutations in ATP6V1B2 as an adaptive mechanism in FL pathogenesis and as a possible new therapeutically targetable pathway.	2020	06	15	J Clin Invest	Wang	Fangyang
34614146	10.1182/blood.2020010263	Validation of POD24 as a robust early clinical end point of poor survival in FL from 5225 patients on 13 clinical trials.	Observational studies and stand-alone trials indicate that patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who experience disease progression within 24 months of front-line chemoimmunotherapy (POD24), have poor outcomes. We performed a pooled analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials of patients with FL in the pre- and postrituximab eras to identify clinical factors that predict POD24. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between clinical factors and POD24. Cox regression evaluated the association between POD24 as a time-dependent factor and subsequent overall survival (OS). A landmark analysis evaluated the association of POD24 with OS for the subset of patients who were alive at 24 months after trial registration. Patients without progression at 24 months at baseline had favorable performance status (PS), limited-stage (I/II) disease, low-risk FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, normal baseline hemoglobin, and normal baseline β2 microglobulin (B2M) level. In a multivariable logistic regression model, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.30), PS ≥2 (OR, 1.63), B2M (≥3 mg/L; OR, 1.43), and high-risk FLIPI score (3-5; OR, 3.14) were associated with increased risk of progression before 24 months. In the time-dependent Cox model and the 24-month landmark analysis, POD24 was associated with poor subsequent OS (hazard ratio, 4.85 and 3.06, respectively). This is the largest pooled analysis of clinical trials data validating POD24 as a robust indicator of poor FL survival and identified clinical predictors of early death and progression that can aid in building comprehensive prognostic models incorporating clinical and molecular predictors of POD24.	2022	04	14	Blood	Casulo	Carla
34664256	10.1111/bjh.17894	Tracking the evolution of untreated high-intermediate/high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by circulating tumour DNA.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogenous malignancy, early identification of patients for relapse remains challenging. The potential to non-invasively monitor tumour evolutionary dynamics of DLBCL needs to be further established. In the present study, 17 tumour biopsy and 38 plasma samples from 38 patients with high-intermediate/high-risk DLBCL were evaluated at baseline. Longitudinal blood samples were also collected during therapy. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) was analysed using targeted sequencing based on a gene panel via a recently developed methodology, circulating single-molecule amplification and re-sequencing technology (cSMART). We found that the most frequently mutated genes were tumour protein p53 (TP53; 42·1%), histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D; 28·9%), caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11; 21·1%), cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein (CREBBP; 15·8%), β<sub>2</sub> -microglobulin (B2M; 15·8%), and tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3; 15·8%). The mutation profiles between ctDNA and matched tumour tissue showed good concordance; however, more mutation sites were detected in ctDNA samples. Either TP53 or B2M mutations before treatment predicted poor prognosis. Analysis of dynamic blood samples confirmed the utility of ctDNA for the real-time assessment of treatment response and revealed that the increases in ctDNA levels and changes in KMT2D mutation status could be useful predictors of disease progression. Our present results suggest that ctDNA is a promising method for the detection of mutation spectrum and serves as a biomarker for disease monitoring and predicting clinical recurrence.	2022	02	14	Br J Haematol	Zhang	Sicong
35075971	10.1080/10428194.2021.2010060	Circulating tumor DNA in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma: a retrospective study.	Few data exist concerning circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) relevance in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). To explore this topic, we applied a 9-gene next-generation sequencing pipeline to samples from forty-four PMBL patients (median age 36.5 years). The primary endpoint was a similarity between paired biopsy/plasma mutational profiles. We detected at least one variant in 32 plasma samples (80%). The similarity between the biopsy and ctDNA genetic profiles for the 30 patients with paired mutated biopsy/plasma samples was greater than or equal to 80% in 19 patients (63.3%). We then compared PMBL ctDNA features with those of a cohort of Hodgkin lymphoma patients (<i>n</i> = 60). The top three mutated genes were <i>SOCS1, TNFAIP3, and B2M</i> in both lymphoma types. PMBL displayed more alterations in <i>TNFAIP3</i> (71.9% vs. 46.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.029) and <i>GNA13</i> (46.9% vs. 17.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.013) than cHL. Our 9-gene set may delineate tumor genotypes using ctDNA samples from both lymphoma types.	2022	04	20	Leuk Lymphoma	Camus	Vincent
35368100	10.1002/hon.2994	A novel clinical immune-related prognostic model predicts the overall survival of mantle cell lymphoma.	The mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) International Prognostic Index (MIPI) and combined MIPI (MIPI-c) are commonly used for risk classification of MCL patients. However, these indexes lack immune-related parameters. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel prognostic model that integrated clinical and immune parameters. A total of 189 patients with newly diagnosed MCL from January 2010 to June 2020 were enrolled in our study. A nomogram and immune-related prognostic index (IRPI) were established to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients according to univariate and multivariate analyses. Discrimination and calibration were used to compare the prognostic performance of the IRPI, MIPI, and MIPI-c. External validation was performed based on validation dataset (n = 150) from two other centers. The results for the training dataset indicated that B symptoms, platelet count, B2M level, CD4+ T-cell count&lt;26.7% and CD8+ T-cell count&gt;44.2% were predictors for OS. All the prognostic factors were integrated into the nomogram. For the overlap of confidence intervals of each variable, we assigned one point for each factor. The IRPI categorized patients into three risk categories: a score of zero indicated low risk, a score of one or two indicated intermediate risk, and a score of ≥3 indicated high risk. The IRPI showed better discrimination and calibration power than the MIPI and MIPI-c in the training dataset and validation dataset. The novel IRPI is a refined risk stratification index and reflects the strong complementary prognostic effects between clinical and immune parameters in MCL.	2022	08	09	Hematol Oncol	Lv	Huijuan
35611992	10.1002/gcc.23069	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is characterized by large-scale copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity.	Development of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is driven by cumulative genomic aberrations. We discovered a unique copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) landscape of PMBL which distinguishes this tumor from other B-cell malignancies, including the biologically related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Using single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis we identified large-scale CN-LOH lesions in 91% (30/33) of diagnostic PMBLs and both investigated PMBL-derived cell lines. Altogether, the cohort showed 157 extra-large (25.3-248.4 Mb) CN-LOH lesions affecting up to 14 chromosomes per case (mean of 4.4) and resulting in a reduction of heterozygosity an average of 9.9% (range 1.3-51%) of the genome. Predominant involvement of terminal chromosomal segments suggests the implication of B-cell specific crossover events in the pathogenesis of PMBL. Notably, CN-LOH stretches non-randomly clustered on 6p (60%), 15 (37.2%), and 17q (40%), and frequently co-occurred with homozygous mutations in the MHC I (6p21), B2M (15q15), and GNA13 (17q23) genes, respectively, as shown by preliminary whole-exome/genome sequencing data. Altogether, our findings implicate CN-LOH as a novel and distinct mutational process contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of PMBL. The aberration acting as ""second hit"" in the Knudson hypothesis, ranks as the major mechanism converting to homozygosity the PMBL-related driver genes. Screening of the cohort of 199 B cell leukemia/lymphoma whole-genomes revealed significant differences in the CN-LOH landscape of PMBL and other B-cell malignancies, including the biologically related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	2022	08	05	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	Tuveri	Stefania
35795062	10.3389/fonc.2022.870487	Plasma Concentrations and Cancer-Associated Mutations in Cell-Free Circulating DNA of Treatment-Naive Follicular Lymphoma for Improved Non-Invasive Diagnosis and Prognosis.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for 10-20% of all lymphomas in western countries. As a clinically heterogeneous cancer, FL occasionally undergoes histological transformation to more aggressive B cell lymphoma types that are associated with poor prognosis. Here we evaluated the potential of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of follicular lymphoma patients. Twenty well-characterized FL cases (13 symptomatic and 7 asymptomatic) were prospectively included in this study. Plasma cfDNA, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue DNA, and patient-matched granulocyte genomic DNA samples were obtained from 20 treatment-naive FL cases. Ultra-deep targeted next-generation sequencing was performed with these DNA samples by using a custom-designed platform including exons and exon-intron boundaries of 110 FL related genes. Using a strict computational bioinformatics pipeline, we identified 91 somatic variants in 31 genes in treatment-naive FL cases. Selected variants were cross-validated by using PCR-Sanger sequencing. We observed higher concentrations of cfDNA and a higher overlap of somatic variants present both in cfDNA and tumor tissue DNA in symptomatic FL cases compared to asymptomatic ones. Variants known to be associated with FL pathogenesis such as STAT6 p.D419 or EZH2 p.Y646 were observed in patient-matched cfDNA and tumor tissue samples. Consistent with previous observations, high Ki-67 staining, elevated LDH levels, FDG PET/CT positivity were associated with poor survival. High plasma cfDNA concentrations or the presence of <i>BCL2</i> mutations in cfDNA showed significant association with poor survival in treatment-naive patients. <i>BCL2</i> mutation evaluations in cfDNA improved the prognostic utility of previously established variables. In addition, we observed that a FL patient who had progressive disease contained histological transformation-associated gene (i.e. <i>B2M</i> and <i>BTG1</i>) mutations only in cfDNA. Pre-treatment concentrations and genotype of plasma cfDNA may be used as a liquid biopsy to improve diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of histological transformation. Targeted therapies related to oncogenic mutations may be applied based on cfDNA genotyping results. However, the results of this study need to be validated in a larger cohort of FL patients as the analyses conducted in this study have an exploratory nature.	2022	07	16	Front Oncol	Hatipoğlu	Tevfik
35885481	10.3390/diagnostics12071575	Cell-Free DNA for Genomic Analysis in Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	High-throughput sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as a promising noninvasive approach in lymphomas, being particularly useful when a biopsy specimen is not available for molecular analysis, as it frequently occurs in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). We used cfDNA for genomic characterization in 20 PMBL patients by means of a custom NGS panel for gene mutations and low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for copy number analysis (CNA) in a real-life setting. Appropriate cfDNA to perform the analyses was obtained in 18/20 cases. The sensitivity of cfDNA to detect the mutations present in paired FFPE samples was 69% (95% CI: 60-78%). The mutational landscape found in cfDNA samples was highly consistent with that of the tissue, with the most frequently mutated genes being <i>B2M</i> (61%), <i>SOCS1</i> (61%), <i>GNA13</i> (44%), <i>STAT6</i> (44%), <i>NFKBIA</i> (39%), <i>ITPKB</i> (33%), and <i>NFKBIE</i> (33%). Overall, we observed a 75% concordance to detect CNA gains/losses between DNA microarray and low-pass WGS. The sensitivity of low-pass WGS was remarkably higher for clonal CNA (18/20, 90%) compared to subclonal alterations identified by DNA microarray. No significant associations between cfDNA amount and tumor burden or outcome were found. cfDNA is an excellent alternative source for the accurate genetic characterization of PMBL cases.	2022	07	31	Diagnostics (Basel)	Rivas-Delgado	Alfredo
36055572	10.1016/j.clim.2022.109105	A novel immune-related epigenetic signature based on the transcriptome for predicting the prognosis and therapeutic response of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Epigenetic modifications contribute to lymphomagenesis. Here, we performed an expression clustering analysis and identified two epigenetic-related clusters (EC1 and EC2). EC1 presented abundant TP53, MYD88, HIST1H1D, HIST1H1C, KMT2D and EZH2 mutations and an inferior prognosis. Pathways involved in the regulation of DNA methylation/demethylation, histone methyltransferase activity, and protein methyltransferase activity were significantly enriched in EC1. However, EC2 was frequently accompanied by B2M, CD70 and MEF2B mutations, which presented with enrichments in DNA damage repair, cytokine-mediated and B-cell activated immune signaling, increased levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-, γδT- and T helper-cells, as well as immune scores and immunogenic cell death (ICD) modulators. According to the prediction, EC1 was more sensitive to vorinostat, serdemetan and navitoclax. However, ruxolitinib, cytarabine and CP466722 were more suitable treatments for EC2. The novel immune-related epigenetic signature exhibits promising clinical predictive value for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), particularly for guiding epigenetic therapeutic regimens. R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) based combination treatment regimens are suggested.	2022	09	10	Clin Immunol	Wang	Xiaoxuan
32079702	10.3324/haematol.2019.237719	Targeted genotyping of circulating tumor DNA for classical Hodgkin lymphoma monitoring: a prospective study.	The relevance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis as a liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease tool in the management of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) patients was demonstrated in retrospective settings and remains to be confirmed in a prospective setting. We developed a targeted Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) panel for fast analysis (AmpliSeq technology) of nine commonly mutated genes in biopies and ctDNA of cHL patients. We then conducted a prospective trial to assess ctDNA follow up at diagnosis and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy (C2). Sixty cHL patients treated by first line conventional chemotherapy (BEACOPPescalated [21.3%], ABVD/ABVD-like [73.5%] and other regimens [5.2%, for elderly patients] were assessed in this non-interventional study. Median age of the patients was 33.5 years (range 20-86). Variants were identified in 42 (70%) patients. Mutations of NFKBIE, TNFAIP3, STAT6, PTPN1, B2M, XPO1, ITPKB, GNA13 and SOCS1 were found in 13.3%, 31.7%, 23.3%, 5%, 33.3%, 10%, 23.3%, 13.3% and 50% of patients, respectively. ctDNA concentration and genotype are correlated with clinical characteristics and presentation. Regarding early therapeutic response, 45 patients (83%, NA=6) had a negative positron emission tomography (PET) after C2 (Deauville Score 1-3). Mean of DeltaSUVmax after C2 was -78.8%. We analyzed ctDNA after C2 for 54 patients (90%). ctDNA became rapidly undetectable in all cases after C2. Variant detection in ctDNA is suitable to depict the genetic features of cHL at diagnosis and may help to assess early treatment response, in association with PET.

32961552	10.1182/blood.2020007507	Mutational landscape of gray zone lymphoma.	The mutational landscape of gray zone lymphoma (GZL) has not yet been established, and differences from related entities are largely unknown. Here, we studied coding sequence mutations of 50 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative GZLs and 20 polymorphic EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (poly-EBV-L) in comparison with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and DLBCL. Exomes of 21 GZL and 7 poly-EBV-L cases, along with paired constitutional DNA, were analyzed as a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 217 genes in an extension cohort of 29 GZL and 13 poly-EBV-L cases. GZL cases with thymic niche involvement (anterior mediastinal mass) exhibited a mutation profile closely resembling cHL and PMBCL, with SOCS1 (45%), B2M (45%), TNFAIP3 (35%), GNA13 (35%), LRRN3 (32%), and NFKBIA (29%) being the most recurrently mutated genes. In contrast, GZL cases without thymic niche involvement (n = 18) had a significantly distinct pattern that was enriched in mutations related to apoptosis defects (TP53 [39%], BCL2 [28%], BIRC6 [22%]) and depleted in GNA13, XPO1, or NF-κB signaling pathway mutations (TNFAIP3, NFKBIE, IKBKB, NFKBIA). They also exhibited more BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements compared with thymic GZL. Poly-EBV-L cases presented a distinct mutational profile, including STAT3 mutations and a significantly lower coding mutation load in comparison with EBV- GZL. Our study highlights characteristic mutational patterns in GZL associated with presentation in the thymic niche, suggesting a common cell of origin and disease evolution overlapping with related anterior mediastinal lymphomas.	2021	09	27	Blood	Sarkozy	Clémentine
32964767	10.1080/10428194.2020.1821011	Frequent mutations in HLA and related genes in extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas.	Extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas (ENKTCLs) are aggressive Epstein-Barr virus-associated T/NK neoplasms that predominantly affect Asians. To explore the causative somatic events, we conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of 19 ENKTCL patients by whole-genome (<i>N</i> = 2), whole-exome (<i>N</i> = 16), and targeted sequencing (<i>N</i> = 15). Commonly deregulated gene pathways in ENKTCLs included epigenetic modifiers (58%, 11/19) followed by human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and related genes including <i>HLA-A</i>, <i>B2M, TAP1, CD274</i>, and <i>PDCD1LG2</i> (32%, 6/19), and JAK-STAT pathway (26%, 5/19). Conspicuously, loss-of-function mutations in <i>HLA-A</i> were recurrently identified in ENKTCLs (16%, 3/19). HLA protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 16 patients and lower expression was associated with advanced stages at presentation (<i>p</i> = .007). In conclusion, the defective antigen presenting pathway is common and related to disease progression, suggesting immune escape as a pathogenic mechanism of ENKTCLs.	2021	04	27	Leuk Lymphoma	Polprasert	Chantana
33311649	10.1038/s41379-020-00720-7	Targeted massively parallel sequencing of mature lymphoid neoplasms: assessment of empirical application and diagnostic utility in routine clinical practice.	Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has become a viable diagnostic tool to interrogate genetic profiles of numerous tumors but has yet to be routinely adopted in the setting of lymphoma. Here, we report the empirical application of a targeted 40-gene panel developed for use in mature lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) and report our experience on over 500 cases submitted for MPS during the first year of its clinical use. MPS was applied to both fresh and fixed specimens. The most frequent diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (116), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (60), marginal zone lymphoma (52), and follicular lymphoma (43), followed by a spectrum of mature T-cell neoplasms (40). Of 534 cases submitted, 471 generated reportable results in MLNs, with disease-associated variants (DAVs) detected in 241 cases (51.2%). The most frequent DAVs affected TP53 (30%), CREBBP (14%), MYD88 (14%), TNFRSF14 (10%), TNFAIP3 (10%), B2M (7%), and NOTCH2 (7%). The bulk of our findings confirm what is reported in the scientific literature. While a substantial majority of mutations did not directly impact diagnosis, MPS results were utilized to either change, refine, or facilitate the final diagnosis in ~10.8% of cases with DAVs and 5.5% of cases overall. In addition, we identified preanalytic variables that significantly affect assay performance highlighting items for specimen triage. We demonstrate the technical viability and utility of the judicious use of a targeted MPS panel that may help to establish general guidelines for specimen selection and diagnostic application in MLNs in routine clinical practice.	2021	12	14	Mod Pathol	Davis	Adam R
33332932	10.4143/crt.2020.1060	Prognostic Stratification of Patients with Burkitt Lymphoma Using Serum β2-microglobulin Levels.	We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serum β2-microglobulin for patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and to propose a risk-stratifying classification system. A prospective registry-based cohort study of BL patients treated with dose-intensive or effective dose-adjusted chemotherapies (n=81) was conducted. Survival outcomes were compared based on previously reported risk groups and/or serum β2-microglobulin levels. A risk-stratifying classification system incorporating serum β2-microglobulin levels was proposed and validated in an independent validation cohort (n=60). The median age was 47 years, and 57 patients (70.4%) were male. Patients with high serum β2-microglobulin levels (&gt; 2 mg/L) had significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (p &lt; 0.01 for both). Serum β2-microglobulin levels further stratified patients in the low-risk and high-risk groups in terms of PFS (p=0.010 and p=0.044, respectively) and OS (p=0.014 and p=0.026, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed that a high serum β2-microglobulin level (&gt; 2 mg/L) was independently associated with a shorter PFS (hazards ratio [HR], 3.56; p=0.047) and OS (HR, 4.66; p=0.043). The new classification system incorporating the serum β2-microglobulin level allowed the stratification of patients into three distinct risk subgroups with 5-year OS rates of 100%, 89.5%, and 62.5%. In an independent cohort of BL, the system was validated by stratifying patients with different survival outcomes. Serum β2-microglobulin level is an independent prognostic factor for BL patients. The proposed β2-microglobulin-based classification system could stratify patients with distinct survival outcomes, which may help define appropriate treatment approaches for individual patients.	2021	12	17	Cancer Res Treat	Kim	Hyung-Don
33567641	10.3390/cancers13040682	Genomic Landscape of Hodgkin Lymphoma.	Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is predominantly composed of reactive, non-neoplastic cells surrounding scarcely distributed tumor cells, that is, so-called Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) or lymphocyte predominant (LP) cells. This scarcity impeded the analysis of the tumor cell genomes for a long time, but recently developed methods (especially laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry/fluorescence-activated cell sorting) facilitated molecular investigation, elucidating the pathophysiological principles of ""Hodgkin lymphomagenesis"". We reviewed the relevant literature of the last three decades focusing on the genomic landscape of classic and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL) and summarized molecular cornerstones. Firstly, the malignant cells of HL evade the immune system by altered expression of <i>PDL1/2</i>, <i>B2M</i> and MHC class I and II due to various genetic alterations. Secondly, tumor growth is promoted by permanently activated JAK/STAT signaling due to pervasive mutations of multiple genes involved in the pathway. Thirdly, apoptosis of neoplastic cells is prevented by alterations of NF-κB compounds and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. Additionally, Epstein-Barr virus infection can simultaneously activate JAK/STAT and NF-κB, similarly leading to enhanced survival and evasion of apoptosis. Finally, epigenetic phenomena such as promoter hypermethylation lead to the downregulation of B-lineage-specific, tumor-suppressor and immune regulation genes. The blueprint of HL genomics has been laid, paving the way for future investigations into its complex pathophysiology.	2021	03	03	Cancers (Basel)	Brune	Magdalena M
33569430	10.21037/atm-20-7574	Molecular profiling of Chinese systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients: novel evidence of genetic heterogeneity.	Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of ALCL may help to improve the clinical management of patients with ALCL. However, due to the rarity of the disease, the genetic heterogeneity of ALCL has not been well elucidated. This study aimed to comprehensively elucidate the mutational landscape of tumor tissue samples from patients with systemic ALCL. Thirty-six patients with systemic ALCL were enrolled in this retrospective study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tumor tissues at baseline to identify anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>) fusions. Capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a panel spanning 112 lymphoma-related genes, including <i>ALK</i> rearrangements, was also performed on tumor tissue samples. A total of 102 mutations were identified in the entire cohort. Among the 36 patients included in this analysis, 14 (38.8%) were <i>ALK</i> positive, as determined by IHC, while NGS showed 12 patients (33.3%) to harbor <i>ALK</i> rearrangements. Younger patients were more likely to have <i>ALK</i>-positive ALCL (P=0.011). Patients with wild-type (WT) <i>ALK</i> were more likely to have single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions or deletions (INDELs) than patients with <i>ALK</i> rearrangements (P=0.027). Among the 22 patients with WT <i>ALK</i>, the most commonly mutated genes were <i>TP53</i> (n=6, 27.3%), followed by <i>NOTCH1</i> (n=5, 22.7%), <i>KMT2D</i> (n=3, 13.6%), <i>KRAS</i> (n=3, 13.6%), <i>TET2</i> (n=3, 13.6%), and <i>JAK1</i> (n=2, 9.1%). Mutations in <i>PRDM1</i>, a commonly mutated gene in <i>ALK</i>-negative patients, were not detected in our <i>ALK</i>-negative cohort. Start-loss of beta-2-microglobulin (<i>B2M</i>) was detected in another patient; this patient had a favorable prognosis, with an overall survival exceeding 19 months. Our study revealed the unique genomic profiles of Chinese ALCL patients and represents an incremental step in deepening the understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of ALCL patients.	2022	04	20	Ann Transl Med	Zhong	Li-Hua
33747936	10.3389/fonc.2021.622648	Genomic Mutation Profile of Primary Gastrointestinal Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Primary gastrointestinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GI-DLBCL) is the most common gastrointestinal lymphoma, but its genetic features are poorly understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 25 primary tumor samples from patients with GI-DLBCL and 23 matched normal tissue samples. Oncogenic mutations were screened, and the correlations between genetic mutations and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Twenty-five patients with GI-DLBCL were enrolled in the genetic mutation analysis with a median of 184 (range 79-382) protein-altering variants per patient. We identified recurrent oncogenic mutations in GI-DLBCL, including those in <i>TP53, MUC16, B2M, CCND3, HIST1H1C, NEB</i>, and <i>ID3</i>. Compared with nodal DLBCL, GI-DLBCL exhibited an increased mutation frequency of <i>TP53</i> and reduced mutation frequencies of <i>PIM1, CREBBP, BCL2, KMT2D</i>, and <i>EZH2</i>. Moreover, GI-DLBCL exhibited fewer <i>MYD88</i> and <i>CD79B</i> mutations than DLBCL in the testis and central nervous system. GI-DLBCLs with <i>HLA-B, MEF2A, RHOA</i>, and <i>NAV3</i> mutations exhibited a tendency toward a high proliferation index. <i>MUC16</i> and <i>ETV6</i> mutations often occurred in tumors with early clinical staging. Our data provide a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of mutations in a small subset of GI-DLBCLs. The genetic mutation profiles of GI-DLBCL differ from those of nodal DLBCL and DLBCL in immune-privileged sites. The different mutated genes are related to the NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathways, and the different pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the development of DLBCL may be influenced by the tissue microenvironment. Differences in genetic alterations might influence the clinicopathological characteristics of GI-DLBCL.	2021	03	23	Front Oncol	Li	Peifeng
33777778	10.3389/fonc.2021.628807	Mutational Profile and Clonal Evolution of Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Primary refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) is an unresolved issue for DLBCL treatment and new treatments to overcome resistance is required. To explore the genetic mechanisms underlying treatment resistance in rrDLBCL and to identify candidate genes, we performed targeted deep sequencing of 430 lymphoma-related genes from 58 patients diagnosed with rrDLBCL. Genetic alterations found between the initial biopsy and biopsy at recurrence or refractory disease were investigated. The genes most frequently altered (&gt; 20%) were (in decreasing order of frequency) <i>CDKN2A, PIM1, CD79B, TP53, MYD88, MYC, BTG2, BTG1, CDKN2B, DTX1, CD58, ETV6</i>, and <i>IRF4</i>. Genes mutation of which in pretreatment sample were associated with poor overall survival included <i>NOTCH1</i>, <i>FGFR2</i>, <i>BCL7A</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, <i>SPEN</i> and <i>TP53</i> (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>FGFR2, BCL2</i>, <i>BCL6</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, and <i>TP53</i> were associated with poor progression-free survival (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Most mutations were truncal and were maintained in both the initial biopsy and post-treatment biopsy with high dynamics of subclones. Immune-evasion genes showed increased overall mutation frequency (<i>CD58, B2M</i>) and variant allele fraction (<i>CD58</i>), and decreased copy number (<i>B2M, CD70</i>) at the post-treatment biopsy. Using the established mutational profiles and integrative analysis of mutational evolution, we identified information about candidate genes that may be useful for the development of future treatment strategies.	2021	03	30	Front Oncol	Lee	Boram
33964277	10.1016/j.humpath.2021.04.014	Relative frequency and clinicopathologic characteristics of MYC-rearranged follicular lymphoma.	MYC rearrangement is a relatively rare genetic abnormality in follicular lymphoma (FL). In this study, we evaluated the relative frequency of MYC rearrangement in 522 cases of FL and studied their clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for MYC (break-apart probe), MYC/IGH, IGH/BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements were performed on tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical stains for CD10, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were performed and scored on MYC-rearranged cases. On 4 FL cases, a custom targeted panel of 356 genes was used for mutation analysis. Ten cases (1.9%) were positive for MYC rearrangement. Histologically, 6 of 10 cases were grade 1-2, and 4 cases were grade 3A. By immunohistochemistry, 9 of 9 tested cases were CD10+, all cases were BCL6+, and 9/10 cases were BCL2+. MYC protein staining was low in all cases tested. IGH/BCL2 rearrangement was detected in 5 of 9 cases, whereas BCL6 rearrangement was detected in 3 of 7 tested cases and 4 of 10 cases showed MYC/IGH rearrangement. The most commonly detected mutations in the MYC-positive cases included HLA-B, TNFRSF14, and KMT2D. MYC and/or B2M abnormalities were detected in 2 cases. In conclusion, MYC rearrangement is uncommon in FL and these cases do not appear to have specific histologic characteristics. Molecular analysis showed abnormalities in genes associated with transformation, namely MYC and B2M. Larger studies are needed to evaluate if MYC-rearrangement in FL has prognostic significance.	2021	12	28	Hum Pathol	Chaudhary	Shweta
34050029	10.1073/pnas.2104504118	Genetic mechanisms of HLA-I loss and immune escape in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Fifty percent of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases lack cell-surface expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), thus escaping recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Here we show that, across B cell lymphomas, loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL. To identify the involved mechanisms, we performed whole exome and targeted HLA deep-sequencing in 74 DLBCL samples, and found somatic inactivation of <i>B2M</i> and the <i>HLA-I</i> loci in 80% (34 of 42) of MHC-I<sup>NEG</sup> tumors. Furthermore, 70% (22 of 32) of MHC-I<sup>POS</sup> DLBCLs harbored monoallelic HLA-I genetic alterations (MHC-I<sup>POS/mono</sup>), indicating allele-specific inactivation. MHC-I<sup>NEG</sup> and MHC-I<sup>POS/mono</sup> cases harbored significantly higher mutational burden and inferred neoantigen load, suggesting potential coselection of <i>HLA-I</i> loss and sustained neoantigen production. Notably, the analysis of &gt;500,000 individuals across different cancer types revealed common germline <i>HLA-I</i> homozygosity, preferentially in DLBCL. In mice, germinal-center B cells lacking HLA-I expression did not progress to lymphoma and were counterselected in the context of oncogene-driven lymphomagenesis, suggesting that additional events are needed to license immune evasion. These results suggest a multistep process of <i>HLA-I</i> loss in DLBCL development including both germline and somatic events, and have direct implications for the pathogenesis and immunotherapeutic targeting of this disease.	2021	12	09	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Fangazio	Marco
34050261	10.1038/s41375-021-01284-4	Lymphoma and multiple myeloma in cohorts of persons exposed to ionising radiation at a young age.	There is limited evidence that non-leukaemic lymphoid malignancies are radiogenic. As radiation-related cancer risks are generally higher after childhood exposure, we analysed pooled lymphoid neoplasm data in nine cohorts first exposed to external radiation aged &lt;21 years using active bone marrow (ABM) and, where available, lymphoid system doses, and harmonised outcome classification. Relative and absolute risk models were fitted. Years of entry spanned 1916-1981. At the end of follow-up (mean 42.1 years) there were 593 lymphoma (422 non-Hodgkin (NHL), 107 Hodgkin (HL), 64 uncertain subtype), 66 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 122 multiple myeloma (MM) deaths and incident cases among 143,136 persons, with mean ABM dose 0.14 Gy (range 0-5.95 Gy) and mean age at first exposure 6.93 years. Excess relative risk (ERR) was not significantly increased for lymphoma (ERR/Gy = -0.001; 95% CI: -0.255, 0.279), HL (ERR/Gy = -0.113; 95% CI: -0.669, 0.709), NHL + CLL (ERR/Gy = 0.099; 95% CI: -0.149, 0.433), NHL (ERR/Gy = 0.068; 95% CI: -0.253, 0.421), CLL (ERR/Gy = 0.320; 95% CI: -0.678, 1.712), or MM (ERR/Gy = 0.149; 95% CI: -0.513, 1.063) (all p-trend &gt; 0.4). In six cohorts with estimates of lymphatic tissue dose, borderline significant increased risks (p-trend = 0.02-0.07) were observed for NHL + CLL, NHL, and CLL. Further pooled epidemiological studies are needed with longer follow-up, central outcome review by expert hematopathologists, and assessment of radiation doses to lymphoid tissues.	2021	12	31	Leukemia	Little	Mark P
34312841	10.1111/bjh.17719	Liquid biopsy: a non-invasive approach for Hodgkin lymphoma genotyping.	The Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) genomic landscape is hardly known due to the scarcity of tumour cells in the tissue. Liquid biopsy employing circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can emerge as an alternative tool for non-invasive genotyping. By using a custom next generation sequencing (NGS) panel in combination with unique molecule identifiers, we aimed to identify somatic variants in the ctDNA of 60 HL at diagnosis. A total of 277 variants were detected in 36 of the 49 samples (73·5%) with a good quality ctDNA sample. The median number of variants detected per patient was five (range 1-23) with a median variant allele frequency of 4·2% (0·84-28%). Genotyping revealed somatic variants in the following genes: SOCS1 (28%), IGLL5 (26%), TNFAIP3 (23%), GNA13 (23%), STAT6 (21%) and B2M (19%). Moreover, several poor prognosis features (high LDH, low serum albumin, B-symptoms, IPI ≥ 3 or at an advanced stage) were related to significantly higher amounts of ctDNA. Variant detection in ctDNA by NGS is a feasible approach to depict the genetic features of HL patients at diagnosis. Our data favour the implementation of liquid biopsy genotyping for the routine evaluation of HL patients.	2021	12	23	Br J Haematol	Alcoceba	Miguel
34374220	10.1002/cjp2.223	c-MYC and p53 expression highlight starry-sky pattern as a favourable prognostic feature in R-CHOP-treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically heterogeneous entity, in which the first-line treatment currently consists of an immuno-chemotherapy regimen (R-CHOP). However, around 30% of patients will not respond or will relapse. Overexpression of c-MYC or p53 is frequently found in DLBCL, but an association with prognosis remains controversial, as for other biomarkers previously linked with DLBCL aggressivity (CD5, CD23, or BCL2). The aim of this study was to explore the expression of these biomarkers and their correlation with outcome, clinical, or pathological features in a DLBCL cohort. Immunohistochemical (c-MYC, p53, BCL2, CD5, and CD23), morphological ('starry-sky' pattern [SSP]), targeted gene panel sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses were performed on tissue microarray blocks for a retrospective cohort of 94 R-CHOP-treated de novo DLBCL. In univariate analyses, p53 overexpression (p53<sup>high</sup> ) was associated with unfavourable outcome (p = 0.04) and with c-MYC overexpression (p = 0.01), whereas c-MYC overexpression was linked with an SSP (p = 0.004), but only tended towards an inferior prognosis (p = 0.06). Presence of a starry-sky morphology was found to be correlated with better survival in p53<sup>high</sup> DLBCL (p = 0.03) and/or c-MYC-positive DLBCL (p = 0.002). Furthermore, NGS data revealed that these three variables were associated with somatic mutations (PIM1, TNFRSF14, FOXO1, and B2M) involved in B-cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and immune signalling. Taken together, these results show that the SSP pattern seems to be a protective factor in high-risk DLBCL subgroups and highlight cell death as a built-in failsafe mechanism to control tumour growth.	2022	02	08	J Pathol Clin Res	Bouroumeau	Antonin
34478526	10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005215	Frequent mutated B2M, EZH2, IRF8, and TNFRSF14 in primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma reflect a GCB phenotype.	Primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PB-DLBCL) is a rare extranodal lymphoma subtype. This retrospective study elucidates the currently unknown genetic background of a large clinically well-annotated cohort of DLBCL with osseous localizations (O-DLBCL), including PB-DLBCL. A total of 103 patients with O-DLBCL were included and compared with 63 (extra)nodal non-osseous (NO)-DLBCLs with germinal center B-cell phenotype (NO-DLBCL-GCB). Cell-of-origin was determined by immunohistochemistry and gene-expression profiling (GEP) using (extended)-NanoString/Lymph2Cx analysis. Mutational profiles were identified with targeted next-generation deep sequencing, including 52 B-cell lymphoma-relevant genes. O-DLBCLs, including 34 PB-DLBCLs, were predominantly classified as GCB phenotype based on immunohistochemistry (74%) and NanoString analysis (88%). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of an extended-NanoString/Lymph2Cx revealed significantly different GEP clusters for PB-DLBCL as opposed to NO-DLBCL-GCB (P &lt; .001). Expression levels of 23 genes of 2 different targeted GEP panels indicated a centrocyte-like phenotype for PB-DLBCL, whereas NO-DLBCL-GCB exhibited a centroblast-like constitution. PB-DLBCL had significantly more frequent mutations in four GCB-associated genes (ie, B2M, EZH2, IRF8, TNFRSF14) compared with NO-DLBCL-GCB (P = .031, P = .010, P = .047, and P = .003, respectively). PB-DLBCL, with its corresponding specific mutational profile, was significantly associated with a superior survival compared with equivalent Ann Arbor limited-stage I/II NO-DLBCL-GCB (P = .016). This study is the first to show that PB-DLBCL is characterized by a GCB phenotype, with a centrocyte-like GEP pattern and a GCB-associated mutational profile (both involved in immune surveillance) and a favorable prognosis. These novel biology-associated features provide evidence that PB-DLBCL represents a distinct extranodal DLBCL entity, and its specific mutational landscape offers potential for targeted therapies (eg, EZH2 inhibitors).	2021	11	01	Blood Adv	de Groen	Ruben A L
35008340	10.3390/cancers14010176	Recent Advances in the Genetic of MALT Lymphomas.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms with B-cell origin, occurring in adult patients and usually having an indolent clinical behavior. These lymphomas may arise in different anatomic locations, sharing many clinicopathological characteristics, but also having substantial variances in the aetiology and genetic alterations. Chromosomal translocations are recurrent in MALT lymphomas with different prevalence among different sites, being the 4 most common: t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(3;14)(p14.1;q32). Several chromosomal numerical abnormalities have also been described, but probably represent secondary genetic events. The mutational landscape of MALT lymphomas is wide, and the most frequent mutations are: <i>TNFAIP3</i>, <i>CREBBP</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>TET2</i>, <i>SPEN</i>, <i>KMT2D</i>, <i>LRP1B</i>, <i>PRDM1</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>TNFRSF14</i>, <i>NOTCH1/NOTCH2</i>, and <i>B2M</i>, but many other genes may be involved. Similar to chromosomal translocations, certain mutations are enriched in specific lymphoma types. In the same line, variation in immunoglobulin gene usage is recognized among MALT lymphoma of different anatomic locations. In the last decade, several studies have analyzed the role of microRNA, transcriptomics and epigenetic alterations, further improving our knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms in MALT lymphoma development. All these advances open the possibility of targeted directed treatment and push forward the concept of precision medicine in MALT lymphomas.	2022	01	14	Cancers (Basel)	Rodríguez-Sevilla	Juan José
31782146	10.1111/bjh.16263	New prognosis score including absolute lymphocyte/monocyte ratio, red blood cell distribution width and beta-2 microglobulin in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP: Spanish Lymphoma Group Experience (GELTAMO).	The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is the most widely used score for non-Hodgkin lymphoma but lacks the ability to identify a high-risk population in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Low absolute lymphocyte count and high monocytes have proved to be unfavourable factors. Red-cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with inflammation and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) with tumour load. The retrospective study included 992 patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. In the multivariate analysis, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), stage, bulky mass, B2M, RDW, and lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) were independently related to progression-free survival (PFS). A new prognosis score was generated with these variables including age categorized into three groups (0, 1, 2 points); ECOG ≥ 3-4 with two; stage III/IV, bulky mass, high B2M, LMR &lt; 2·25 and RDW &gt; 0·96 with one each; for a maximum of 9. This score could improve the discrimination of a very high-risk subgroup with five-year PFS and overall survival (OS) of 19% and 24% versus 45% and 59% of R (revised)-IPI respectively. This score also showed greater predictive ability than IPI. A new score is presented including complete blood cell count variables and B2M, which are readily available in real-life practice without additional tests. Compared to R-IPI, it shows a more precise high-risk assessment and risk discrimination for both PFS and OS.	2020	11	13	Br J Haematol	Bento	Leyre
31804029	10.1111/ejh.13364	Evaluation of the MD Anderson tumor score for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the rituximab era.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive heterogeneous lymphoma with standard treatment. However, 30%-40% of patients still fail, so we should know which patients are candidates for alternative therapies. IPI is the main prognostic score but, in the rituximab era, it cannot identify a very high-risk (HR) subset. The MD Anderson Cancer Center reported a score in the prerituximab era exclusively considering tumor-related variables: Tumor Score (TS). We aim to validate TS in the rituximab era and to analyze its current potential role. From GELTAMO DLBCL registry, we selected those patients homogeneously treated with R-CHOP (n = 1327). Five-years PFS and OS were 62% and 74%. All variables retained an independent prognostic role in the revised TS (R-TS), identifying four different risk groups, with 5-years PFS of 86%, 71%, 50%, and very HR (28%). With a further categorization of three variables of the original TS (Ann Arbor Stage, LDH and B2M), we generated a new index that allowed an improvement in HR assessment. (a) All variables of the original TS retain an independent prognostic role, and R-TS remains predictive in the rituximab era; (b) R-TS and additional categorization of LDH, B2M, and AA stage (enhanced TS) increased the ability to identify HR subsets.	2021	01	18	Eur J Haematol	Gutierrez	Antonio
31822802	10.1038/s41379-019-0428-0	Diagnostic utility of STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> expression in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and related entities.	Although the distinction of classical Hodgkin lymphoma from nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma using morphology and immunostains is straightforward in most instances, occasional cases pose diagnostic challenge. We sought to determine the utility of the novel YE361 STAT6 rabbit monoclonal antibody in Hodgkin lymphoma and diagnostically challenging B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma entities with Hodgkin-like features. Cases from seven institutions included: 57 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (31% EBV+), 34 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas, 34 mimicking B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 7 reactive lymphoproliferations. After review of histology, STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> immunostaining was performed. The intensity and spatial localization of immunopositivity was assessed in neoplastic cells. Additional FISH for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) was performed in one patient in paired treatment-naive and relapse biopsy tissues. Two STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> immunopositive cases were examined by whole-exome sequencing after flow sorting to assess mutations in STAT6 pathway genes. Most classical Hodgkin lymphomas showed nuclear staining for STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> [46/57 cases (80%)] on Hodgkin cells. Staining was exclusively nuclear in a minority [12/46 (26%)], while dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization was more common [34/46 (74%)]. In contrast, all nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas [0/34 (0%)] were negative for nuclear STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> staining on the lymphocyte predominant cells. Within B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, nuclear STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> was seen in: B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Strong PD-L1 gene amplification was noted in the paired cHL and relapse B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, although STAT6<sup>YE361</sup> was negative in both biopsies.

32172489	10.1007/s10637-020-00916-3	Phase I dose escalation study of BI 836826 (CD37 antibody) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	BI 836826 is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 antibody targeting CD37, a tetraspanin transmembrane protein predominantly expressed on normal and malignant B cells. This phase I, open-label study used a modified 3 + 3 design to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of BI 836826 in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; NCT01403948). Eligible patients received up to three courses comprising an intravenous infusion (starting dose: 1 mg) once weekly for 4 weeks followed by an observation period of 27 (Course 1, 2) or 55 days (Course 3). Patients had to demonstrate clinical benefit before commencing treatment beyond course 2. Forty-eight patients were treated. In the dose escalation phase (1-200 mg) involving 37 Caucasian patients, the MTD was 100 mg. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in four patients during the MTD evaluation period, and included stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. The most common adverse events were neutropenia (57%), leukopenia (57%), and thrombocytopenia (41%), and were commonly of grade 3 or 4. Overall, 18 (38%) patients experienced infusion-related reactions, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. Preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity was seen; three patients responded to treatment, including one complete remission in a Korean patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. BI 836826 plasma exposure increased more than proportionally with increasing doses. BI 836826 demonstrated preliminary activity; the most frequent adverse events were hematotoxicity and infusion-related reactions which were manageable after amending the infusion schedule. Although BI 856826 will not undergo further clinical development, these results confirm CD37 as a valid therapeutic target in B cell NHL.	2021	09	02	Invest New Drugs	Kroschinsky	Frank
32304999	10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102731	Circulating tumor DNA predicts response in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma treated with sintilimab.	Blood-based biomarker such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising tool for assessment of response to immunotherapy in solid tumors; But in hematological malignances, evidences are still lacking to support its clinical utility. In current study the feasibility of ctDNA for prediction and monitoring of response to anti-PD-1 therapy in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r cHL) was assessed. A total of 192 plasma samples from 75 patients with r/r cHL were collected at baseline and upon therapeutic evaluation. ctDNA were sequenced by targeting panels capturing frequently mutated genes in cHL and other hematological malignancies and then quantified. Analysis on: 1) Gene mutation profile and association of the gene mutations with progression-free survival; 2) Association of pre- and post-treatment ctDNA variant allelic frequencies with clinical outcome; (3) Correlation of the mutated genes with treatment resistance; were performed. Somatic mutations were detected in 50 out of 61 patients by ctDNA genotyping. The mutations of CHD8 was significantly higher in patients with PFS ≥ 12 months. Baseline ctDNA was significantly higher in responders and a decrease of ctDNA ≥ 40% from baseline indicated superior clinical outcome. Strong agreement between ctDNA dynamic and radiographic response change during therapy was observed in majority of the patients. Furthermore, the mutations of B2M, TNFRSF14 and KDM2B were found to be associated with acquired resistance. ctDNA could be an informative biomarker for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in r/r cHL.

32399964	10.1002/ijc.33049	Molecular profiling of Chinese R-CHOP treated DLBCL patients: Identifying a high-risk subgroup.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically aggressive and heterogenous disease. Although most patients can be cured by immunochemotherapy, 30% to 40% patient will ultimately develop relapsed or refractory disease. Here, we investigated the molecular landscapes of patients with diverse responses to R-CHOP. We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on baseline samples of 105 DLBCL patients using a panel consisting of 112 lymphoma-related genes. Subsequently, 81 treatment-naïve patients with measurable disease and followed for over 1 year were included for survival analysis. Collectively, the most commonly seen mutations included IGH fusion (69%), PIM1(33%), MYD88 (29%), BCL2 (29%), TP53 (29%), CD79B (25%) and KMT2D (24%). Patients with TP53 mutations were more likely to have primary refractory disease (87.0% vs 50.0%, P = .009). For those with TP53 disruptive mutations, 91.7% patients were in the primary refractory group. Interestingly, BCL-2 somatic hypermutation was only seen in patients without primary refractory disease (P = .014). In multivariate analysis, BCL-2 amplification (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.94, P = .022), B2M mutation (HR = 2.99, P = .017) and TP53 mutation (HR = 3.19, P &lt; .001) were independently associated with shorter time to progression (TTP). Furthermore, TP53 mutations was correlated with worse overall survival (P = .049). Next, we investigated mutation landscape in patients with wild-type (WT) TP53 (n = 58) and found that patients harboring MYD88 L265P had significantly inferior TTP than those with WT or non-265P (P = .046). Our study reveals the mutation spectrum of treatment-naive Chinese DLBCL patients. It also confirms the clinical significance of TP53 mutations and indicates the prognostic value of MYD88 L265P in TP53 WT patients.	2021	04	19	Int J Cancer	Jiang	Shiyu
30108156	10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0058	Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Hodgkin Lymphoma Reveals Recurrently Mutated Genes and Increased Mutation Burden.	The genomic landscape of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has been difficult to characterize due to the paucity of neoplastic cells and an abundant microenvironment. Such characterization is needed in order to improve treatment strategies. We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using targeted next-generation sequencing on archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples from 63 patients to analyze the landscape of HL. CGP was successful for 49/63 archival specimens (78%), and revealed aberrations impacting genes including <i>B2M</i>, <i>TP53</i>, and <i>XPO1</i> (E571). Of the 34 patients for whom total mutation burden (TMB; mutations/megabase [Mb]) was assessed, 5 (15%) had high TMB (≥20 mutations/Mb), 18 (53%) had intermediate TMB (6-19 mutations/Mb), and 11 (32%) had low TMB (≤5 mutations/Mb). We next tested 13 patients' plasma cell-free DNA with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction for the presence of <i>XPO1</i> E571 mutation, which was confirmed in the plasma of 31% of patients. In three patients with serially collected plasma samples, <i>XPO1</i> E571K allelic frequency changes corresponded with changes in tumor size on conventional radiographic imaging. The study demonstrates that comprehensive genomic profiling of archival Hodgkin lymphoma tumor samples is feasible and leads to the identification of genes that are recurrently mutated and that Hodgkin lymphoma has increased mutation burden in the majority of samples analyzed. Furthermore, tracking of <i>XPO1</i> E571 mutant allele frequency in a subset of patients may also represent a potential disease-monitoring strategy and warrants further investigation. This study provides the first evidence that comprehensive genomic profiling can be performed to map the genomic landscape of Hodgkin lymphoma and that a subpopulation of patients has mutations in <i>TP53</i>, <i>B2M</i>, <i>XPO1</i>, and other genes. It was found that 15% of patients have high mutation burden, which, in cancers such as melanoma, may indicate sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and may thus be explored for Hodgkin lymphoma. Lastly, this work demonstrates that changes in the mutant allele frequency of <i>XPO1</i> in serially collected plasma cell-free DNA samples correspond with treatment outcomes measured with conventional radiographic imaging.	2020	03	20	Oncologist	Liang	Winnie S
30591526	10.1182/blood-2018-08-862292	Single-cell RNA-Seq of follicular lymphoma reveals malignant B-cell types and coexpression of T-cell immune checkpoints.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a low-grade B-cell malignancy that transforms into a highly aggressive and lethal disease at a rate of 2% per year. Perfect isolation of the malignant B-cell population from a surgical biopsy is a significant challenge, masking important FL biology, such as immune checkpoint coexpression patterns. To resolve the underlying transcriptional networks of follicular B-cell lymphomas, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 34 188 cells derived from 6 primary FL tumors. For each tumor, we identified normal immune subpopulations and malignant B cells, based on gene expression. We used multicolor flow cytometry analysis of the same tumors to confirm our assignments of cellular lineages and validate our predictions of expressed proteins. Comparison of gene expression between matched malignant and normal B cells from the same patient revealed tumor-specific features. Malignant B cells exhibited restricted immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain expression (either Igκ or Igλ), as well the expected upregulation of the <i>BCL2</i> gene, but also downregulation of the <i>FCER2</i>, <i>CD52</i>, and major histocompatibility complex class II genes. By analyzing thousands of individual cells per patient tumor, we identified the mosaic of malignant B-cell subclones that coexist within a FL and examined the characteristics of tumor-infiltrating T cells. We identified genes coexpressed with immune checkpoint molecules, such as <i>CEBPA</i> and <i>B2M</i> in regulatory T (Treg) cells, providing a better understanding of the gene networks involved in immune regulation. In summary, parallel measurement of single-cell expression in thousands of tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be used to obtain a systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment and identify new avenues for therapeutic development.	2019	11	12	Blood	Andor	Noemi
30792096	10.1016/j.clml.2019.01.003	Next Generation Sequencing-based Validation of the Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma: An Analysis of the MMRF CoMMpass Study.	The clinical application of the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) for multiple myeloma may be limited by heterogeneity in clinical interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) practices for detecting chromosomal abnormalities (CAs). Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based FISH (Seq-FISH) has demonstrated improved sensitivity and similar specificity relative to clinical FISH, and provides a standardized, single-pass method for identifying high-risk CAs. To date, calculating R-ISS stage using Seq-FISH (R-ISS-NGS) has not been validated. We identified 672 patients with sufficient data to calculate R-ISS-NGS from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass Study. R-ISS-NGS was calculated from original ISS stage, lactate dehydrogenase, and CAs detected by Seq-FISH. Endpoints included overall survival and progression-free survival. We conducted multivariate analyses controlling for age and gender in order to compare outcomes across stages I to III of both the original ISS and R-ISS-NGS. The median follow-up was 24 months. The R-ISS-NGS resulted in significant redistribution of patients into stage II, relative to the original ISS. With respect to stage I, R-ISS-NGS stages II and III of were associated with worse progression-free survival or overall survival, more so than the staging schema of the ISS, thus validating the use of Seq-FISH in staging. Using CAs detected by Seq-FISH and data from the CoMMpass study, we validated the R-ISS with a large, generalizable cohort. This study validates the substitution of Seq-FISH for clinical FISH, especially in large registry studies. Additionally, use of the validated R-ISS-NGS will strengthen outcomes research generated from the CoMMpass study.	2020	07	06	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Goldsmith	Scott R

Short responses to immunochemotherapy predict for an inferior OS in follicular lymphoma. We set out to determine whether this is also the case in marginal zone lymphoma. A group of 139 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) patients treated with front-line immuno- or immunochemotherapy (I/ICT) were categorized into I/ICT-refractory (non-response or relapse/progression within six months of treatment response assessment) or I/ICT-sensitive. Twenty-three patients (17%) were refractory. Refractory patients had inferior OS (4-yr probabilities of 57% vs. 83%, <i>p</i> = .0003) as did those with beta2-microglobulin (B2M)&gt;3 mg/L (4-yr probabilities of 80% vs. 100%, <i>p</i> = .0029). On multivariable analysis they both showed a borderline significant correlation with OS (<i>p</i> = .06 and .07, respectively). B2M &gt; 3 mg/L was also an adverse prognostic factor for progression-free survival in both univariable (4-yr probability of 61% vs. 83%, <i>p</i> = .02) and multivariable analysis (HR 2.9, <i>p</i> = .02). In conclusion, B2M and refractoriness to I/ICT may identify patients with MZL at higher risk of inferior survival.	2020	08	17	Leuk Lymphoma	Sorigue	Marc
31006875	10.1002/ajh.25493	Detection of extranodal and spleen involvement by FDG-PET imaging predicts adverse survival in untreated follicular lymphoma.	Predicting early clinical failure in patients with untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) is important but difficult. This study aimed to determine the incidence and patterns of extranodal (EN) and spleen disease using PET/CT, and assess their utility in predicting early clinical failure. PET/CT images from 613 cases of untreated FL (2003-2016) were reviewed. The location and number of EN sites, patterns of bone involvement, and splenic involvement were recorded. Outcomes were assessed using event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and early clinical failure at 24 months (EFS24). So, 49% (301/613) of patients had PET/CT-detected EN involvement, and 28% (171/613) had spleen involvement. The presence of ≥2 EN sites, spleen, bone or soft tissue involvement all predicted failure to achieve EFS24. Presence of ≥2 EN sites and bone involvement pattern were also predictive of OS in a univariate analysis. In a multivariate analysis with FLIPI-2 factors, spleen involvement, pattern of bone involvement, and soft tissue involvement independently predicted a lower EFS (HR 1.49 (1.11-2.00), P = .007; HR 1.71 (1.10-2.65), P = .017; and HR 1.67 (1.06-2.62), P = .026, respectively). When the multivariate analysis was performed using PRIMA-PI factors (marrow and B2M), the number of EN sites was an independent prognostic factor for inferior OS (HR 2.28; P = .05). Baseline PET/CT identifies EN involvement in nearly half of patients with untreated FL. The presence of ≥2 EN sites, bone, soft tissue, or splenic involvement predicts early clinical failure. These results, when combined with other factors, may better identify high-risk patients and guide therapy.	2020	03	10	Am J Hematol	St-Pierre	Frédérique
31205619	10.1016/j.csbj.2019.03.006	Application of PD-1 Blockade in Cancer Immunotherapy.	The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway has received considerable attention due to its role in eliciting the immune checkpoint response of T cells, resulting in tumor cells capable of evading immune surveillance and being highly refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Application of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as checkpoint inhibitors is rapidly becoming a promising therapeutic approach in treating tumors, and some of them have successfully been commercialized in the past few years. However, not all patients show complete responses and adverse events have been noted, suggesting a better understanding of PD-1 pathway mediated immunosuppression is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here, we review the progresses on the studies of the mechanistic role of PD-1 pathway in the tumor immune evasion, recent clinical development and commercialization of PD-1 pathway inhibitors, the toxicities associated with PD-1 blockade observed in clinical trials as well as how to improve therapeutic efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy.	2020	09	28	Comput Struct Biotechnol J	Wu	Xiaomo
31211907	10.1111/ejh.13274	The tumour microenvironment is immuno-tolerogenic and a principal determinant of patient outcome in EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL) is a recently identified entity. Data regarding outcome to frontline immuno-chemotherapy are conflicting. Although the prognostic impact of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in EBV<sup>-neg</sup> DLBCL is well-established, it remains untested whether the TME influences survival in EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL. There are no data with new digital gene expression technologies that simultaneously interrogate the virus, B cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME). We used the NanoString™ platform in a population-based cohort of 433 patients to establish if the technology could detect EBV in the tumour biopsies and to investigate the influence that EBV has on the complex tumour microenvironment of DLBCL. Incidence of EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL was 6.9% with 5-year survival of 65% vs 82% in EBV<sup>-neg</sup> DLBCL (P = 0.018). EBV<sup>-pos</sup> tissues had similar expression of T-cell genes compared to EBV<sup>-neg</sup> DLBCL but higher levels of the antigen-presenting molecule B2M. This was countered by elevated PD-L1, PD-L2, LAG3 and TIM3 immune checkpoints and a higher CD163/CD68 ""M2"" macrophage score. In EBV<sup>-pos</sup> DLBCL, the TME is immuno-tolerogenic and may explain the poor outcomes seen in this subtype of DLBCL.	2020	01	24	Eur J Haematol	Keane	Colm
31292115	10.1182/blood.2019001126	Integrative genomic analysis identifies key pathogenic mechanisms in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) represents a clinically and pathologically distinct subtype of large B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, molecular studies, including global gene expression profiling, have provided evidence that PMBL is more closely related to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Although targeted sequencing studies have revealed a number of mutations involved in PMBL pathogenesis, a comprehensive description of disease-associated genetic alterations and perturbed pathways is still lacking. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 95 PMBL tumors to inform on oncogenic driver genes and recurrent copy number alterations. The integration of somatic gene mutations with gene expression signatures provides further insights into genotype-phenotype interrelation in PMBL. We identified highly recurrent oncogenic mutations in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and nuclear factor κB pathways, and provide additional evidence of the importance of immune evasion in PMBL (<i>CIITA, CD58, B2M, CD274,</i> and <i>PDCD1LG2</i>). Our analyses highlight the interferon response factor (IRF) pathway as a putative novel hallmark with frequent alterations in multiple pathway members (<i>IRF2BP2, IRF4,</i> and <i>IRF8</i>). In addition, our integrative analysis illustrates the importance of <i>JAK1, RELB,</i> and <i>EP300</i> mutations driving oncogenic signaling. The identified driver genes were significantly more frequently mutated in PMBL compared with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, whereas only a limited number of genes were significantly different between PMBL and cHL, emphasizing the close relation between these entities. Our study, performed on a large cohort of PMBL, highlights the importance of distinctive genetic alterations for disease taxonomy with relevance for diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making.	2020	01	27	Blood	Mottok	Anja
31324639	10.1182/bloodadvances.2018026591	IgA levels at diagnosis predict for infections, time to treatment, and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	To better understand the relationship between baseline immunoglobulin measurements and subsequent clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we performed a retrospective analysis on 660 patients with CLL (72%), monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) (13%), and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (14%), diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 at CancerCare Manitoba. Of 511 patients who had their first immunoglobulin level determined within 3 months of diagnosis, abnormal (either increased or decreased) immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA values were observed in 58% of patients with CLL, 27% of patients with MBL, and 20% of patients with SLL. Immunoglobulin deviances were similar for MBL and CLL Rai stage 0 and for SLL and Rai stages I and II; for CLL, IgG and IgA abnormalities occurred with increasing frequency with advancing Rai stage. In contrast, the frequency of IgM abnormalities was similar in all patient groups. IgA abnormalities significantly correlated with high β2-microglobulin (B2M) expression, whereas abnormal IgG and IgA levels were associated with the use of <i>IGHV</i>1-69, 3-21, and 3-49 subtypes. Increases in IgG or IgM were commonly associated with the presence of a CLL-type M-band, whereas oligoclonal bands were frequently observed with increased IgA levels. Although abnormal levels of IgG and IgA at diagnosis were independent predictors for future immunoglobulin replacement, only abnormal IgA levels were associated with shorter time to first treatment and overall survival. These findings indicate that both reduced and elevated levels of IgG and IgA at diagnosis are important and independent prognostic markers for infection in CLL, with IgA being more relevant as a marker of disease progression and survival.	2020	07	07	Blood Adv	Ishdorj	Ganchimeg
31423206	10.3892/ol.2019.10410	Clinical significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and histone deacetylases 1 and 2 expression in peripheral T-cell lymphoma.	Epigenetics serve a key role in peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) expression in PTCL. A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the present study, including 43 with PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), 10 with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 14 with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TCL) and 15 with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). EZH2 and HDAC1/2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and any correlations between them were evaluated. Additionally, any correlations between EZH2 or HDAC1/2 expression and a number of clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed, and survival curves were created. Results revealed that 55.8% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 86.7% of patients ALCL and 50% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC1. Furthermore, 58.1% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 53.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC2. Additionally, 67.5% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 50% of patients with NK/TCL, 73.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed EZH2. EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with the presence of B symptoms, elevated LDH and elevated β2 microglobulin (B2M; P&lt;0.05), and HDAC2 expression was significantly correlated with sex, advanced clinical stages, high international prognostic index scores and elevated B2M levels (P&lt;0.05) in all the patients with PTCL. However, different subtypes of PTCL are correlated with different clinical characteristics. Patients with PTCL highly expressing EZH2 or HDAC2 exhibit a poorer overall survival rate. In conclusion, EZH2 and HDAC1/2 were frequently upregulated in patients with PTCL, and the patients with a higher EZH2 and HDAC2 expression usually exhibited a poorer survival rate. Therefore, EZH2 and HDAC2 may be prognostic markers in patients with PTCL, particularly in those with PTCL-NOS.	2020	10	01	Oncol Lett	Zhang	Huilai
31597848	10.11406/rinketsu.60.1229	[The immune microenvironment in malignant lymphoma].	Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the importance of the tumor microenvironment. Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from lymphocytes and typically develop in lymphoid tissues. It has been recognized that the elements of the lymphoma microenvironment are not mere bystanders to a host antitumor inflammatory response but are important components of the tumor that support proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of lymphoma cells. Lymphoma cells have individual expression patterns of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, according to their histological subtypes, and the patterns of surface molecules determine the sites of tumor involvement. Lymphoma cells often depend on the signals provided by non-tumor cells, such as stromal cells and macrophages, through direct cell contact and paracrine factors. On the other hand, there are genetic and non-genetic mechanisms allowing lymphoma cells to escape from anti-tumor immunity, such as downregulation of HLA molecules, B2M, CD58, CD70, and/or upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Further understanding of the interactions of lymphoma cells and the tumor microenvironment gives an insight into the pathogenesis of lymphomas and supports new approaches to their treatment.	2019	10	25	Rinsho Ketsueki	Nishikori	Momoko

31697821	10.1182/blood.2019002067	Genomic analyses of PMBL reveal new drivers and mechanisms of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade.	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBLs) are aggressive tumors that typically present as large mediastinal masses in young women. PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional, and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations -somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants-in a cohort of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identified a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL, including known and newly identified components of the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identified driver mutations in ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modifier, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identified several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related lymphoid malignancies.	2020	04	13	Blood	Chapuy	Bjoern
31816062	10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001012	Genomic analyses of flow-sorted Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells reveal complementary mechanisms of immune evasion.	Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is composed of rare malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells within an extensive, but ineffective, inflammatory/immune cell infiltrate. HRS cells exhibit near-universal somatic copy gains of chromosome 9p/9p24.1, which increase expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligands. To define genetic mechanisms of response and resistance to PD-1 blockade and identify complementary treatment targets, we performed whole-exome sequencing of flow cytometry-sorted HRS cells from 23 excisional biopsies of newly diagnosed cHLs, including 8 Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) tumors. We identified significantly mutated cancer candidate genes (CCGs) as well as somatic copy number alterations and structural variations and characterized their contribution to disease-defining immune evasion mechanisms and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT, and PI3K signaling pathways. EBV- cHLs had a higher prevalence of genetic alterations in the NF-κB and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathways. In this young cHL cohort (median age, 26 years), we identified a predominant mutational signature of spontaneous deamination of cytosine- phosphate-guanines (""Aging""), in addition to apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like, activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated hypermutation. In particular, the mutational burden in EBV- cHLs was among the highest reported, similar to that of carcinogen-induced tumors. Together, the overall high mutational burden, MSI-associated hypermutation, and newly identified genetic alterations represent additional potential bases for the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in cHL. Of note, recurrent cHL alterations, including B2M, TNFAIP3, STAT6, GNA13, and XPO1 mutations and 2p/2p15, 6p21.32, 6q23.3, and 9p/9p24.1 copy number alterations, were also identified in &gt;20% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas, highlighting shared pathogenetic mechanisms in these diseases.	2020	09	22	Blood Adv	Wienand	Kirsty
29289361	10.1016/j.blre.2017.12.001	The pathobiology of primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Implications for novel therapies.	Primary testicular lymphomas (PTL) are the most prevalent type of testicular cancer arising in men over the age of 60. PTL accounts for approximately 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and most present with localized disease but despite this, outcome is poor. The majority of cases represent an extranodal manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), known as primary testicular DLBCL (PT-DLBCL). Gene expression profiling has established that over 75% of PT-DLBCLs resemble the activated B-cell-like (ABC) or non-germinal center subtype of nodal DLBCL. In distilling the specific mutational landscape and immunophenotypic profiles, immune-escape and sustained signalling emerge as prominent features of PT-DLBCL. These include genomic alterations arising within the core components of antigen presentation (CIITA, B2M, and HLA loci) and structural rearrangements of programmed death ligands 1 (CD274) and 2 (PDCD1LG2). Enrichment for somatic mutations within NF-κB pathway genes (MYD88, CD79B, NFKBIZ, BCL10, and MALT1) also feature prominently in PT-DLBCL. Taken together, the unique molecular and clinical characteristics of PT-DLBCL have informed on aspects of the distinct disease biology of this organotypic lymphoma that may guide rational therapeutic strategies.	2019	03	21	Blood Rev	Twa	David D W
29394125	10.1200/JCO.2017.77.3994	Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II and Programmed Death Ligand 1 Expression Predict Outcome After Programmed Death 1 Blockade in Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma.	Purpose Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells evade antitumor immunity by multiple means, including gains of 9p24.1/ CD274(PD-L1)/ PDCD1LG2(PD-L2) and perturbed antigen presentation. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor blockade is active in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) despite reported deficiencies of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on HRS cells. Herein, we assess bases of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) in the CheckMate 205 trial. Methods HRS cells from archival tumor biopsies were evaluated for 9p24.1 alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization and for expression of PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the antigen presentation pathway components-β2-microglobulin, MHC class I, and MHC class II-by immunohistochemistry. These parameters were correlated with clinical responses and progression-free survival (PFS) after PD-1 blockade. Results Patients with higher-level 9p24.1 copy gain and increased PD-L1 expression on HRS cells had superior PFS. HRS cell expression of β2-microglobulin/MHC class I was not predictive for complete remission or PFS after nivolumab therapy. In contrast, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was predictive for complete remission. In patients with a &gt; 12-month interval between myeloablative autologous stem-cell transplantation and nivolumab therapy, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was associated with prolonged PFS. Conclusion Genetically driven PD-L1 expression and MHC class II positivity on HRS cells are potential predictors of favorable outcome after PD-1 blockade. In cHL, clinical responses to nivolumab were not dependent on HRS cell expression of MHC class I.	2019	08	01	J Clin Oncol	Roemer	Margaretha G M
29625928	10.1016/j.clml.2018.03.005	Serum Free Light Chain Difference and β<sub>2</sub> Microglobulin Levels Are Risk Factors for Thromboembolic Events in Patients With AL Amyloidosis.	AL amyloidosis might increase the risk of thromboembolism and other plasma cell dyscrasias; however, only a few reports have described the clinical features of thromboembolism. The present study aimed to elucidate the clinical features of thromboembolic events and to identify the risk factors for these events. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed to define the clinically significant thromboembolic events. A total of 106 patients with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis were included. During a median follow-up of 18.1 months (range, 0.4-166.9 months), 13 thromboembolism events were identified in 13 patients. Of the 13 patients, 9 (8.5%) experienced acute cerebral infarction, 2 (1.9%) experienced pulmonary embolism, and 2 (1.9%) experienced deep vein thrombosis. Patients with a higher serum free light chain (FLC) difference (≥ 172.4 mg/L) or β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β2MG) levels (≥ 2.78 mg/L) experienced significantly more thromboembolic events compared with those with a lower value according to multivariable analysis (for FLC difference: hazard ratio, 4.309; 95% confidence interval, 1.158-16.032; P = .029; for β2MG: hazard ratio, 9.739; 95% confidence interval, 1.127-84.174; P = .039). Most thromboembolic events (11 of 13; 84.6%) occurred within the first year after the AL amyloidosis diagnosis. The incidence of thromboembolism was substantial in those with AL amyloidosis. A greater FLC difference and for β2MG levels were risk factors for thromboembolic events.	2019	08	06	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	Park	Hyunkyung
29657120	10.1016/j.canrad.2017.11.005	Breast lymphoma occurring after an invasive ductal breast carcinoma developed in the same area: A case report and literature review.	Chemo- and radiotherapy are treatments very helpful to cure cancers but are also well known for adverse effects such as secondary cancers. Breast cancers following Hodgkin lymphoma have been relatively well studied. Breast cancers after radiotherapy covering or nearby breasts or nipples are usually carcinomas or secondary sarcomas. Among the big cohort of patients treated for breast carcinomas, breast lymphomas developed in the same area are not usual. Nevertheless, published studies described a significant increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma after initial radiotherapy for a solid cancer. Here, we report a case of a secondary breast lymphoma observed in a 53-year-old woman treated 13 years before for a ductal carcinoma and analyse such second tumors with a review of the literature. This case report emphasizes the importance of the biopsy in case of recurrence in breast cancer to give the appropriate treatment.	2018	05	17	Cancer Radiother	Demoor-Goldschmidt	C
29857068	10.1016/j.jid.2018.04.038	Genomic Analyses Identify Recurrent Alterations in Immune Evasion Genes in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Leg Type.	Cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are aggressive lymphomas with a poor prognosis. To elucidate their genetic bases, we analyzed exome sequencing of 37 cutaneous DLBCLs, including 31 DLBCLs, leg type (DLBCL-LT) and 6 cutaneous DLBCLs-not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS). As reported previously, 77% of DLBCL-LT harbor NF-κB-activating MYD88 mutations. In nearly all MYD88-wild-type DLBCL-LT, we found cancer-promoting mutations that either activate the NF-κB pathway through alternative genes (NFKBIE or REL) or activate other canonical cancer pathways (BRAF, MED12, PIK3R1, and STAT3). After NF-κB, the second most commonly mutated pathway putatively enables immune evasion via mutations predicted to downregulate antigen processing (B2M, CIITA, HLA) or T-cell co-stimulation (CD58). DLBCL-LT have little genetic overlap with the genetically heterogeneous DLBCL-NOS. Instead, they resemble primary central nervous system and testicular large B-cell lymphomas (primary central nervous system lymphomas and primary testicular lymphomas). Like primary central nervous system lymphomas/primary testicular lymphomas, 40% of DLBCL-LT (vs. 0% of DLBCLs-not otherwise specified) harbored PDL1/PDL2 translocations, which lead to overexpression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 in 50% of the cases. Collectively, these data broaden our understanding of cutaneous DLBCLs and suggest novel therapeutic approaches (e.g., BRAF or PI3K inhibitors). Additionally, they suggest novel treatment paradigms, wherein DLBCL-LT can be targeted with strategies (e.g., immune checkpoint blockers) currently being developed for genomically similar primary central nervous system lymphomas/primary testicular lymphomas.	2019	09	13	J Invest Dermatol	Zhou	Xiaolong Alan
29872358	10.1177/1179299X18776974	Clean Colorectum at Diagnostic Colonoscopy: Subsequent Detection of Extracolonic Malignancies by Plasma Protein Biomarkers?	Most of the subjects undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy do not have neoplastic bowel lesions. Potentially, some of the symptoms may therefore be caused by extracolonic malignancy, and subjects with persisting symptoms may need subsequent examinations. Blood-based, cancer-associated biomarkers may aid in directing the examinations for other specific malignant diseases. EDTA plasma samples available from a previous prospective study of subjects undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy were used for analysis of 18 protein biomarkers. The study population of 3732 subjects included 400 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 177 patients with extracolonic malignancies. Univariable analysis of the association of specific biomarkers and extracolonic cancers included those with 10 or more cases. Subsequently, reduced models of 4 or 6 biomarkers, respectively, were established by choosing those with the highest likelihood; age and sex were included as well. Univariable analyses showed that CyFra21-1 had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.87 for lung cancers (n = 33), CA19-9 had an AUC of 0.85 for pancreatic cancer (n = 22), CA125 had an AUC of 0.95 for ovary cancer (n = 16), B2M had an AUC of 0.81 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 12), and total prostate-specific antigen had an AUC of 0.99 for prostate cancer (n = 10). The multivariable analysis of 4 or 6 biomarkers plus age and sex as explanatory variables showed AUCs of 0.82 to 0.85 both for extracolonic cancers and CRC. The 4 biomarkers included in the model for detection of extracolonic cancers were CA125, hsCRP, CA19-9, and CyFra21-1; the 2 additional for the 6 biomarkers model were CEA and Galectin-3. Similarly, the 4 biomarkers included in the model for detection of CRC were CEA, CyFra21-1, Ferritin, and HE4; the two additional for the 6 biomarkers model were hsCRP and Pepsinogen 2. Results of this study indicate that it may be possible to detect subjects that have an increased risk of extracolonic cancer following a colonoscopy without findings of neoplastic lesions. Combinations of various protein biomarkers may direct subsequent examination after colonoscopy with clean colorectum. The results, although preliminary, may form the basis for additional research directed both for primary examinations of subjects with symptoms of malignancy and subsequent examinations after colonoscopy.	2022	03	17	Biomark Cancer	Wilhelmsen	Michael
30087457	10.1038/s41374-018-0096-6	Novel cell enrichment technique for robust genetic analysis of archival classical Hodgkin lymphoma tissues.	Approximately 15% of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) die after relapse or progressive disease. Comprehensive genetic characterization is required to better understand its molecular pathology and improve management. However, genetic information on cHL is hard to obtain mainly due to rare malignant Hodgkin- and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSC), whose overall frequencies in the affected tissues ranges from 0.1 to 10%. Therefore, enrichment of neoplastic cells is necessary for the majority of genetic investigations. We have developed a new high-throughput method for marker-based enrichment of archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue-derived HRSC nuclei by fluorescence-assisted flow sorting (FACS) and successfully applied it on ten cHL cases. Genomic DNA extracted from sorted nuclei was used for targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 68 genes that are frequently affected in lymphomas. Chromosomal copy number aberrations were investigated by the Agilent SurePrint 180k microarray. Our method enabled HRSC nuclei enrichment to 40-90% in sorted populations. This level of enrichment was sufficient for reliable identification of tumor-specific mutations and copy number aberrations. Genetic analysis revealed that components of JAK-STAT signaling pathway were affected in all investigated tumors by frequent mutations of SOCS1 and STAT6 as well as copy number gains of JAK2. Involvement of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway compounds was evident from recurrent gains of the locus containing the REL gene and mutations in TNFAIP3 and CARD11. Finally, genetic alterations of PD-L1 and B2M suggested immune evasion as mechanisms of oncogenesis in some patients. In this work, we present a new method for HRSC enrichment from FFPE tissue blocks by FACS and demonstrate the feasibility of a wide-scale genetic analysis by cutting-edge molecular methods. Our work opens the door to a large resource of archived clinical cHL samples and lays foundation to more complex studies aimed to answer important biological and clinical questions that are critical to improve cHL management.	2019	06	13	Lab Invest	Juskevicius	Darius
28302137	10.1186/s13045-017-0438-7	Mutations of CREBBP and SOCS1 are independent prognostic factors in diffuse large B cell lymphoma: mutational analysis of the SAKK 38/07 prospective clinical trial cohort.	Recently, the mutational background of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been revealed, identifying specific genetic events that drive lymphomagenesis. However, the prognostic value of these mutations remains to be determined. Prognostic biomarkers in DLBCL are urgently needed, since the current clinical parameter-based factors (e.g., International Prognostic Index (IPI)) are insufficient, particularly in identifying patients with poor prognosis who might benefit from alternative treatments. We investigated the prognostic value of somatic mutations in DLBCL in a clinical trial (NCT00544219) patient cohort homogenously treated with six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), followed by two cycles of R (R-CHOP-14). The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of tumor genomic DNA was performed on all exons or hotspots of 68 genes frequently mutated in B cell lymphomas. Mutational data was correlated with the endpoints to identify prognostic associations. Targeted HTS detected somatic mutations in 71/76 (93%) of investigated cases. The most frequently mutated genes were KMT2D, SOCS1, GNA13, and B2M. Survival analysis revealed that CREBBP- and EP300-mutated cases had significantly worse OS, PFS, and EFS. In addition, ATM mutations predicted worse outcomes for all three clinical endpoints in germinal center B cell-like DLBCL. In contrast, SOCS1 mutations were associated with better PFS. On multivariable analysis taken into account IPI and failure to achieve complete remission, CREBBP and EP300 mutations remained significant to predict worse OS, PFS, and EFS. Targeted mutation analysis of a uniformly treated prospective clinical trial DLBCL cohort identifies tumor-based genetic prognostic markers that could be useful in the clinical management of such patients.

28372509	10.1080/10428194.2017.1307981	FcγRIIb expression in early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	In normal B-cells, B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling can be negatively regulated by the low-affinity receptor FcγRIIb (CD32b). To better understand the role of FcγRIIb in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we correlated its expression on 155 samples from newly-diagnosed Binet A patients with clinical characteristics and outcome. FcγRIIb expression was similar in normal B-cells and leukemic cells, this being heterogenous among patients and within CLL clones. FcγRIIb expression did not correlate with well known prognostic markers [disease stage, serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), IGHV mutational status, expression of ZAP-70 and CD38, and cytogenetics] except for a weak concordance with CD49d. Moreover, patients with low FcγRIIb expression (69/155, 44.5%) required therapy earlier than those with high FcγRIIb expression (86/155, 55.5%) (median 151.4 months vs. not reached; p=.071). These results encourage further investigation on the role of FcγRIIb in CLL biology and prognostic significance in larger series of patients.	2018	04	17	Leuk Lymphoma	Bosch	Rosa
28398499	10.1093/annonc/mdx128	Outcome of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP: results from the UK NCRI R-CHOP14v21 trial with combined analysis of molecular characteristics with the DSHNHL RICOVER-60 trial.	There is an on-going debate whether 2- or 3-weekly administration of R-CHOP is the preferred first-line treatment for elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The UK NCRI R-CHOP14v21 randomized phase 3 trial did not demonstrate a difference in outcomes between R-CHOP-14 and R-CHOP-21 in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients aged 19-88 years, but data on elderly patients have not been reported in detail so far. Here, we provide a subgroup analysis of patients ≥60 years treated on the R-CHOP14v21 trial with extended follow-up. Six hundred and four R-CHOP14v21 patients ≥60 years were included in this subgroup analysis, with a median follow-up of 77.7 months. To assess the impact of MYC rearrangements (MYC-R) and double-hit-lymphoma (DHL) on outcome in elderly patients, we performed a joint analysis of cases with available molecular data from the R-CHOP14v21 (N = 217) and RICOVER-60 (N = 204) trials. Elderly DLBCL patients received high dose intensities with median total doses of ≥98% for all agents. Toxicities were similar in both arms with the exception of more grade ≥3 neutropenia (P &lt; 0.0001) and fewer grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia (P = 0.05) in R-CHOP-21 versus R-CHOP-14. The elderly patient population had a favorable 5-year overall survival (OS) of 69% (95% CI: 65-73). We did not identify any subgroup of patients that showed differential response to either regimen. In multivariable analysis including individual factors of the IPI, gender, bulk, B2M and albumin levels, only age and B2M were of independent prognostic significance for OS. Molecular analyses demonstrated a significant impact of MYC-R (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.22-3.16; P = 0.01) and DHL (HR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.18-4.11; P = 0.01) on OS in the combined trial cohorts, independent of other prognostic factors. Our data support equivalence of both R-CHOP application forms in elderly DLBCL patients. Elderly MYC-R and DHL patients have inferior prognosis and should be considered for alternative treatment approaches.

28419429	10.1111/bjh.14633	Mutational landscape of B-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders.	It is currently unclear whether post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PT-DLBCL) display a similar genomic landscape as DLBCL in immunocompetent patients (IC-DLBCL). We investigated 50 post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) including 37 PT-DLBCL samples for somatic mutations frequently observed in IC-DLBCL. Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using the Ion Torrent platform and a customized panel of 68 genes was performed on genomic DNA. Non-tumoural tissue was sequenced to exclude germline variants in cases where available. A control cohort of 76 IC-DLBCL was available for comparative analyses. In comparison to IC-DLBCLs, PT-DLBCL showed more frequent mutations of TP53 (P = 0·004), and absence of ATM and B2M mutations (P = 0·004 and P = 0·016, respectively). In comparison to IC-DLBCLs, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)<sup>+</sup> PT-DLBCL had fewer mutated genes (P = 0·007) and particularly fewer mutations in nuclear factor-κB pathway-related genes (P = 0·044). TP53 mutations were more frequent in EBV<sup>-</sup> PT-DLBCL as compared to IC-DLBCL (P = 0·001). Germinal centre B cell (GCB) subtype of PT-DLBCL had fewer mutations and mutated genes than GCB-IC-DLBCLs (P = 0·048 and 0·04 respectively). Polymorphic PTLD displayed fewer mutations as compared to PT-DLBCL (P = 0·001). PT-DLBCL differs from IC-DLBCL with respect to mutations in genes related to DNA damage control and immune-surveillance, and EBV association is likely to have a bearing on the mutational pattern.	2017	09	05	Br J Haematol	Menter	Thomas
29228708	10.18632/oncotarget.21963	Blood biomarkers in adults with lymph node enlargement contribute to diagnostic significance of malignancy.	Lymph node enlargement is a common presentation and has a possibility of malignancy like lymphoma that requires early diagnosis. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of these patients and finds out useful predictors of malignant diseases. We retrospectively investigated 81 patients with lymph node enlargement between July 2, 2014 and May 17, 2016. The characteristics and laboratory findings were evaluated combining with the final diagnosis. The diagnoses were malignancy in 51 patients and benign lymphadenopathy in 30 patients. Increased beta2-microglobulin (B2M) (<i>P</i> = 0.012) was found to be associated with malignant diseases, and level of 3699.5 μg/L was used as a cut-off value to differentiate the malignancies from benign diseases, offering 63.4% sensitivity and 87.0% specificity. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) (<i>P</i> = 0.038) levels were significantly lower in malignant group, whose receiver operating characteristic curve showed that level of 1121.5 mg/dl had sensitivity and specificity as 58.5% and 82.6%. Moreover, through analysis of cytokines, we found interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were elevated in malignant group compared with benign group. Serum B2M and IgG levels were concluded to be useful parameters for predicting malignancies. Besides, increased IL-10 levels indicated a higher risk of malignancy in some way.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Ma	Shanshan
25689467	10.1002/hon.2188	Serum beta-2 microglobulin as a prognostic biomarker in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.	Although serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested as a prognostic factor for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), additional data are necessary to confirm its role. Between November 2005 and July 2014, a total of 52 patients with MCL were identified from the database of Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Pretreatment serum B2M information was available in 50 patients (96%). Overall survival (OS) was compared according to the serum B2M level with a cut-off value of 2.5 mg/L. The median MCL international prognostic index (MIPI) score was 5.84 (range 4.72-7.80), and the median biologic MIPI (MIPI-b) score was 6.27 (4.93-8.47). Pretreatment serum B2M was elevated in 30 patients (60%) and was significantly related to advanced stage (p = 0.02) and high MIPI (p = 0.03) and MIPI-b (p = 0.03) scores. With median follow-up duration of 29.8 months (range 0.8-87.0 months), the median OS was 56.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 36.6-75.9 months] in all patients, and serum B2M was significantly associated with OS (p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses adjusted for MIPI or MIPI-b scores and rituximab, elevated serum B2M was significantly associated with poor OS (when adjusting MIPI, hazard ratio = 26.4, 95% CI 2.9-241.3, p = 0.004; when adjusting MIPI-b, hazard ratio = 20.1, 95% CI 2.4-170.1, p = 0.006). Thus, pretreatment serum B2M may be an independent and significant prognostic factor in patients with MCL.	2016	07	27	Hematol Oncol	Yoo	Changhoon
26268515	10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000042	Evaluation of serum and urine fetuin-A levels in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during and after high-dose methotrexate therapy: Relation to toxicity.	Fetuin-A is a multifunctional protein with its urine level was considered as a marker of acute kidney injury. We investigated the serum and urine fetuin-A in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children during and after high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). Twenty-two ALL children and 20 matched healthy controls were included. Liver transaminases, serum creatinine, estimated glomular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine clearance (CrCl), serum β2 microglobulin (B2M), and serum and urine fetuin-A levels were assayed pre and 4 months after the consolidation. Among a subgroup of 15 patients, the investigations were performed 42 hours after the start of the second and the fourth HDMTX infusions. HDMTX was well tolerated. During HDMTX, there was significant decline in serum fetuin-A together with significant rise of urine fetuin-A and B2M levels compared to the control and to the pre-consolidation levels, changes that persisted 4 months after the consolidation despite recovery of the significantly altered renal functions. The second HDMTX-related serum fetuin-A level directly correlated with eGFR and CrCl (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.0001 and r = 0.67, P = 0.016, respectively). Four months after consolidation, urine fetuin-A directly correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.54, P = 0.004) and inversely correlated with the eGFR (r = -0.66, P &lt; 0.0001). Significant disturbance in serum and urinary fetuin-A levels, which was related to renal functions, had occurred during HDMTX and persisted for at least 4 months after the consolidation. Serum and urine fetuin-A could be sensitive markers for subtle renal dysfunction in ALL children.	2017	03	02	Hematology	Ragab	Seham M

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by heterogeneous clinical behavior and there is a need for improved biomarkers. The current study evaluated the prognostic significance of serum free light chains (sFLC, kappa, and lambda) and other serum markers (bar, serum thymidine kinase (sTK), soluble CD23, and LDH) together with established biomarkers in 289 patients enrolled into the LRF CLL4 trial. In a multivariable analysis of serum markers alone, higher big and kappa light chains were statistically significant in predicting disease progression and higher blg, and sTK in predicting mortality. In multivariable analysis for overall survival the following were independently significant: β2M levels, immunoglobulin gene (IGHV) mutational status (&gt;98% homology), age, 17p13 deletions (&gt;10%), and CD38 expression. β2M is the only serum marker that retained clear independent value as a biomarker in the LRF CLL4 trial and remains powerfully prognostic requiring evaluation in any future method of risk stratifying patients.	2017	12	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Pratt	Guy
26752561	10.1371/journal.pone.0146624	Proteomics Based Identification of Proteins with Deregulated Expression in B Cell Lymphomas.	Follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas comprise the main entities of adult B cell malignancies. Although multiple disease driving gene aberrations have been identified by gene expression and genomic studies, only a few studies focused at the protein level. We applied 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare seven GC B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines with a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). An average of 130 spots were at least two folds different in intensity between NHL cell lines and the LCL. We selected approximately 38 protein spots per NHL cell line and linked them to 145 unique spots based on the location in the gel. 34 spots that were found altered in at least three NHL cell lines when compared to LCL, were submitted for LC-MS/MS. This resulted in 28 unique proteins, a substantial proportion of these proteins were involved in cell motility and cell metabolism. Loss of expression of B2M, and gain of expression of PRDX1 and PPIA was confirmed in the cell lines and primary lymphoma tissue. Moreover, inhibition of PPIA with cyclosporine A blocked cell growth of the cell lines, the effect size was associated with the PPIA expression levels. In conclusion, we identified multiple differentially expressed proteins by 2-D proteomics, and showed that some of these proteins might play a role in the pathogenesis of NHL. 	2016	07	04	PLoS One	Wu	Rui

To determine the prognostic significance of beta2 microglobulin (β2-m) concentrations in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare disorder caused by pathologic activation of the immune system. The study population consisted of 74 patients diagnosed with HLH and 35 healthy controls. Serum β2-m levels were measured using a latex agglutination photometric immunoassay. Median serum β2-m levels were significantly higher in HLH patients than in healthy controls (4.05 versus 1.5 mg/L; P &lt; 0.001) and were significantly higher in patients with lymphoma associated hemophagocytic syndrome (LAHS) than in patients with benign disease-associated HLH (4.2 versus 3.3 mg/L; P &lt; 0.001). Higher serum β2-m levels were positively correlated with LAHS (P = 0.005), abnormal lactate dehydrogenase concentrations (P = 0.009), and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.003). ROC analysis showed that overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in LAHS patients with serum β2-m levels ≥4.03 mg/L compared to &lt;4.03 mg/L (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that serum β2-m level was an independent prognostic of OS (P = 0.034) in patients with LAHS. High serum β2-m levels and LAHS were associated with markedly poorer OS in patients with HLH. Serum β2-m concentration was a powerful and independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with LAHS.	2016	12	13	Dis Markers	Jiang	Tiantong
27276707	10.18632/oncotarget.9793	Relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma present different genomic profiles between early and late relapses.	Despite major advances in first-line treatment, a significant proportion of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will experience treatment failure. Prognosis is particularly poor for relapses occurring less than one year after the end of first-line treatment (early relapses/ER) compared to those occurring more than one year after (late relapses/LR). To better understand genomic alterations underlying the delay of relapse, we identified copy number variations (CNVs) on 39 tumor samples from a homogeneous series of patients included in the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) prospective study. To identify CNVs associated with ER or LR, we devised an original method based on Significance Analysis of Microarrays, a permutation-based method which allows control of false positives due to multiple testing. Deletions of CDKN2A/B (28%) and IBTK (23%) were frequent events in relapsed DLBCLs. We identified 56 protein-coding genes and 25 long non-coding RNAs with significantly differential CNVs distribution between ER and LR DLBCLs, with a false discovery rate &lt; 0.05. In ER DLBCLs, CNVs were related to transcription regulation, cell cycle and apoptosis, with duplications of histone H1T (31%), deletions of DIABLO (26%), PTMS (21%) and CK2B (15%). In LR DLBCLs, CNVs were related to immune response, with deletions of B2M (20%) and CD58 (10%), cell proliferation regulation, with duplications of HES1 (25%) and DVL3 (20%), and transcription regulation, with MTERF4 deletions (20%). This study provides new insights into the genetic aberrations in relapsed DLBCLs and suggest pathway-targeted therapies in ER and LR DLBCLs.	2018	02	21	Oncotarget	Broséus	Julien
27389058	10.1038/leu.2016.161	Emerging therapies provide new opportunities to reshape the multifaceted interactions between the immune system and lymphoma cells.	The acquisition of a complete neoplastic phenotype requires cancer cells to develop escape mechanisms from the host immune system. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'immune evasion,' represents a hallmark of cancers and results from a Darwinian selection of the fittest tumor clones. First reported in solid tumors, cancer immunoescape characterizes several hematological malignancies. The biological bases of cancer immunoescape have recently been disclosed and include: (i) impaired human leukocyte antigen-mediated cancer cell recognition (B2M, CD58, CTIIA, CD80/CD86, CD28 and CTLA-4 mutations); (ii) deranged apoptotic mechanisms (reduced pro-apoptotic signals and/or increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules); and (iii) changes in the tumor microenvironment involving regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. These immune-escape mechanisms characterize both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin (B and T cell) lymphomas and represent a promising target for new anti-tumor therapies. In the present review, the principles of cancer immunoescape and their role in human lymphomagenesis are illustrated. Current therapies targeting these pathways and possible applications for lymphoma treatment are also addressed.	2017	08	29	Leukemia	Pizzi	M
27835906	10.18632/oncotarget.13239	Whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although rituximab therapy improves clinical outcome, some patients develop resistant DLBCL; however, the genetic alterations in these patients are not well documented. To identify the genetic background of refractory DLBCL, we conducted whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing for six patients with refractory and seven with responsive DLBCL. The average numbers of pathogenic somatic single nucleotide variants and indels in coding regions were 71 in refractory patients (range 28-120) and 38 (range 19-66) in responsive patients. Missense mutations of TP53 were exclusive in 50% (3/6) of refractory patients and involved the DNA-binding domain of TP53. All missense mutations of TP53 were accompanied by copy number deletions. RAB11FIP5, PRKCB, PRDM15, FNBP4, AHR, CEP128, BRE, DHX16, MYO6, and NMT1 mutations were recurrent in refractory patients. MYD88, B2M, SORCS3, and WDFY3 mutations were more frequent in refractory patients than in responsive patients. REL-BCL11A fusion was found in two refractory patients; one had both fusion and copy number gain. Recurrent copy gains of POU2AF1, SLC1A4, REL11, FANCL, CACNA1D, TRRAP, and CUX1 with significantly increased average expression were found in refractory patients. The expression profile revealed enriched gene sets associated with treatment resistance, including oxidative phosphorylation and ATP-binding cassette transporters. In conclusion, this study integrated both genomic and transcriptomic alterations associated with refractory DLBCL and found several treatment-resistance alterations that may contribute to refractoriness.	2018	02	22	Oncotarget	Park	Ha Young
27959929	10.1371/journal.pmed.1002197	Histological Transformation and Progression in Follicular Lymphoma: A Clonal Evolution Study.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet incurable B cell malignancy. A subset of patients experience an increased mortality rate driven by two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early progression after immunochemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading to these clinical end points is poorly understood, and previously determined genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology over the time course of FL clinical histories. Using a combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, and digital droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse specimens, we deciphered the constituent clonal populations in 15 transformation cases and 6 progression cases, and measured the change in clonal population abundance over time. We observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in transformed cases relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were generally composed of clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens, consistent with dramatic clonal expansions that came to dominate the transformation specimens. This pattern was independent of time to transformation and treatment modality. By contrast, early progression specimens were composed of clones that were already present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only moderate clonal dynamics, even in the presence of immunochemotherapy. Analysis of somatic mutations impacting 94 genes was undertaken in an extension cohort consisting of 395 samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted biology in the two clinical end points. We found 12 genes that were more commonly mutated in transformed samples than in the preceding FL tumors, including TP53, B2M, CCND3, GNA13, S1PR2, and P2RY8. Moreover, ten genes were more commonly mutated in diagnostic specimens of patients with early progression, including TP53, BTG1, MKI67, and XBP1. Our results illuminate contrasting modes of evolution shaping the clinical histories of transformation and progression. They have implications for interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of treatment-induced selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and progression will require different clinical management strategies.	2017	05	23	PLoS Med	Kridel	Robert
24913511	10.3109/10428194.2014.917640	Prognostic impact of β₂-microglobulin in patients with non-gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	Although serum β₂-microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested as a prognostic factor for several hematologic malignancies, it has not been comprehensively investigated in non-gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Between January 2000 and May 2013, a total of 174 patients with non-gastric MALT lymphoma were identified from a prospectively developed database. Baseline serum B2M was elevated in 17 (10%) patients. In univariate analysis, serum B2M ≥ 2.5 mg/L was significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS, p &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (OS, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified serum B2M as an independent prognostic factor in PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-10.0; p = 0.02) and OS (HR = 26.9, 95% CI: 2.7-269.7; p = 0.005), after adjustment for IPI and treatment modalities. Baseline serum B2M is an independent prognostic factor in patients with non-gastric MALT lymphoma.	2016	03	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Yoo	Changhoon
25488972	10.1182/blood-2014-11-610436	Flow sorting and exome sequencing reveal the oncogenome of primary Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells.	Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by sparsely distributed Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells amid reactive host background, complicating the acquisition of neoplastic DNA without extensive background contamination. We overcame this limitation by using flow-sorted HRS and intratumor T cells and optimized low-input exome sequencing of 10 patient samples to reveal alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation, chromosome integrity, transcriptional regulation, and ubiquitination. β-2-microglobulin (B2M) is the most commonly altered gene in HRS cells, with 7 of 10 cases having inactivating mutations that lead to loss of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression. Enforced wild-type B2M expression in a cHL cell line restored MHC-I expression. In an extended cohort of 145 patients, the absence of B2M protein in the HRS cells was associated with lower stage of disease, younger age at diagnosis, and better overall and progression-free survival. B2M-deficient cases encompassed most of the nodular sclerosis subtype cases and only a minority of mixed cellularity cases, suggesting that B2M deficiency determines the tumor microenvironment and may define a major subset of cHL that has more uniform clinical and morphologic features. In addition, we report previously unknown genetic alterations that may render selected patients sensitive to specific targeted therapies. 	2015	04	21	Blood	Reichel	Jonathan
25577449	10.1016/j.transci.2014.12.007	Beta-2 microglobulin predicts the outcome after autologous stem cell transplantation in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an established therapeutic modality in the treatment of lymphomas, especially in the relapse setting. In the present study, we aimed to define pretransplantation factors including Beta-2 microglobulin (β2m) that influence outcomes following ASCT in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We analyzed retrospectively 78 NHL patients who had undergone ASCT from August 2010 to January 2013. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 70% and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 60%. While remission status less than complete remission (CR) emerged to be a poor prognostic factor for OS in univariate analysis, high β2m levels and comorbidity indices revealed to be independent poor risk factors for both OS and PFS. The present study demonstrated that even if the patient is in CR before ASCT if he has high β2m, the 2-year OS decreases from 100% to 49%. Moreover, lymphopenia for the first time was demonstrated to predict PFS in ASCT in NHL patients. Our findings suggest that β2m at transplantation predict the outcome after ASCT in NHL and further investigation with larger sample sizes is warranted.	2015	09	25	Transfus Apher Sci	Atesoglu	Elif Birtas
25622250	10.3390/ijms16022307	Gentamicin arrests cancer cell growth: the intriguing involvement of nuclear sphingomyelin metabolism.	The use of gentamicin for the treatment of bacterial infection has always been an interesting and highly speculated issue for the scientific community. Conversely, its effect on cancer cells has been very little investigated. We studied the effect of high doses of gentamicin on non-Hodgkin's T-cell human lymphoblastic lymphoma (SUP-T1). We showed that gentamicin delayed cell growth and induced cell death in lymphoma cells with a rather mild effect on lymphocytes. In SUP-T1 cells, GAPDH, B2M, CDKN1A and CDKN1B were down-expressed in comparison with lymphocytes. Gentamicin treatment in SUP-T1 cells restored the expression of GAPDH, B2M and CDKN1A to values similar to those of lymphocytes and caused overexpression of CDKN1B. The drug acted via sphingomyelin metabolism; in whole cells, sphingomyelinase activity was stimulated, whereas in purified nuclei, sphingomyelinase activity was inhibited and that of sphingomyelin-synthase was stimulated, with a consequent high level of nuclear sphingomyelin content. We suggest that the increase of nuclear sphingomyelin might enrich the nucleus of lipid microdomains that act as a platform for active chromatin and, thus, might be responsible for gene expression. It is possible that in lymphoblastic lymphoma, high doses of gentamicin induce a beneficial therapeutic outcome. 	2015	09	25	Int J Mol Sci	Codini	Michela
25981322	10.1016/j.bulcan.2015.03.013	[Endocrine sequelae after treatment of pediatric cancer: From childhood to adulthood].	Endocrine sequelae are among the most frequently reported complications in childhood cancer survivors, affecting 40 to 60% of these patients during adult life. Most of these complications are the result of cranial radiation therapy for brain or facial tumor, lymphoma or leukemia. The present review describes the main endocrine disturbances observed in this population, including disorders of hypothalamic-pituitary axis, especially the frequently observed growth hormone deficiency and disorders of puberty, thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction, obesity and metabolic syndrome, alterations in glucose metabolism and decreased bone mineral density. Gonadal dysfunction is not described, since it is detailed in another chapter. During childhood, prompt diagnosis and management of endocrine complications allow improvement of final height outcome and body composition (lean body mass and bone mass), reducing morbidity and impaired quality of life later in adulthood. Risk of developing a second neoplasm after growth hormone therapy in cancer survivors is also addressed. Life-long follow-up and management of endocrine deficiencies are essential to reduce late morbidity especially cardiovascular risk, and to diagnose late-onset deficiencies as well as radiation-induced thyroid nodules and cancer.	2015	09	28	Bull Cancer	Thomas-Teinturier	Cécile
25991819	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2116	Genome-Wide Analysis Uncovers Novel Recurrent Alterations in Primary Central Nervous System Lymphomas.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the central nervous system. Whether there is a PCNSL-specific genomic signature and, if so, how it differs from systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is uncertain. We performed a comprehensive genomic study of tumor samples from 19 immunocompetent PCNSL patients. Testing comprised array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole exome sequencing. Biallelic inactivation of TOX and PRKCD was recurrently found in PCNSL but not in systemic DLBCL, suggesting a specific role in PCNSL pathogenesis. In addition, we found a high prevalence of MYD88 mutations (79%) and CDKN2A biallelic loss (60%). Several genes recurrently affected in PCNSL were common with systemic DLBCL, including loss of TNFAIP3, PRDM1, GNA13, TMEM30A, TBL1XR1, B2M, CD58, activating mutations of CD79B, CARD11, and translocations IgH-BCL6. Overall, B-cell receptor/Toll-like receptor/NF-κB pathways were altered in &gt;90% of PNCSL, highlighting its value for targeted therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, integrated analysis showed enrichment of pathways associated with immune response, proliferation, apoptosis, and lymphocyte differentiation. In summary, genome-wide analysis uncovered novel recurrent alterations, including TOX and PRKCD, helping to differentiate PCNSL from systemic DLBCL and related lymphomas.	2016	06	07	Clin Cancer Res	Braggio	Esteban
26068922	10.1371/journal.pone.0129298	Plasma Hsp90 Level as a Marker of Early Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Engraftment and Progression in Mice.	Current monitoring of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in living mice is based on FACS analysis of blood hCD45+ cells. In this work, we evaluated the use of human IGFBP2, B2M or Hsp90 as soluble markers of leukemia. ELISA for B2M and IGFBP2 resulted in high background levels in healthy animals, precluding its use. Conversely, plasma levels of Hsp90 showed low background and linear correlation to FACS results. In another experiment, we compared Hsp90 levels with percentage of hCD45+ cells in blood, bone marrow, liver and spleen of animals weekly sacrificed. Hsp90 levels proved to be a superior method for the earlier detection of ALL engraftment and correlated linearly to ALL burden and progression in all compartments, even at minimal residual disease levels. Importantly, the Hsp90/hCD45+ ratio was not altered when animals were treated with dexamethasone or a PI3K inhibitor, indicating that chemotherapy does not directly interfere with leukemia production of Hsp90. In conclusion, plasma Hsp90 was validated as a soluble biomarker of ALL, useful for earlier detection of leukemia engraftment, monitoring leukemia kinetics at residual disease levels, and pre-clinical or mouse avatar evaluations of anti-leukemic drugs. 	2016	04	21	PLoS One	Milani	Mateus
26291013	10.1097/JTO.0000000000000624	PTPRF Expression as a Potential Prognostic/Predictive Marker for Treatment with Erlotinib in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.	EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements are, to date, the only approved biomarkers to select treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is considerable interest in identifying other predictive markers. The PTPRF gene has been suggested as a marker of interest in NSCLC and other tumor types. This hypothesis-generating retrospective analysis examined data from two studies of erlotinib in NSCLC, Marker Identification Trial (MERIT; n = 102) and Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable NSCLC (SATURN; n = 262), to determine whether PTPRF expression was prognostic and/or predictive of patient outcomes. Exploratory analyses were conducted using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on existing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, to assess gene expression levels, including PTPRF. High versus low levels of expression were dichotomized using the median with B2M as a control comparator. Progression-free survival and overall survival were then compared for patients with high versus low levels of PTPRF in the two studies. PTPRF expression was found to be prognostic for shorter overall survival but was also significantly predictive of improved survival with erlotinib versus placebo in SATURN (hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.30-0.69] in PTPRF high versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62-1.48] in PTPRF low; interaction p = 0.02), even in the EGFR wild-type subpopulation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.29-0.68] versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62-1.48]; interaction p = 0.01). PTPRF may have value as a predictive marker to identify which patients can obtain the greatest benefit from erlotinib in the post-first-line setting. Further research is warranted to determine the potential value of this marker in clinical decision-making.	2016	06	13	J Thorac Oncol	Soulières	Denis
26350140	10.1016/j.leukres.2015.08.016	Beta-2 microglobulin is a strong prognostic factor in patients with DLBCL receiving R-CHOP therapy.	Useful prognostic markers for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been reported. To identify which biomarker best predicts the prognosis of patients with DLBCL, we performed a retrospective study that included 319 DLBCL patients who had received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) therapy between 2003 and 2012. We assessed the prognostic significance of six biomarkers [lactate dehydrogenase, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, thymidine kinase activity, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), C-reactive protein, and ferritin] and representative clinical characteristics using progression-free survival (PFS) as the endpoint. The study group included 181 men and 138 women with a median age of 63 years (range, 22-89 years). In a multivariate analysis, the serum B2M level most strongly correlated with PFS (hazard ratio, 2.11; P=0.04). In a univariate analysis, patients with serum B2M levels &gt;1.75μg/mL (n=210) had a worse 3-year PFS rate (71.2%) than those with B2M levels &lt;1.75μg/mL (n=109; 90.0%). Therefore, serum B2M level at the time of diagnosis is a useful prognostic indicator in DLBCL patients receiving R-CHOP.	2022	03	31	Leuk Res	Miyashita	Kazuho
24180329	10.3109/10428194.2013.850167	Soluble interleukin-2 receptor level predicts survival in patients with follicular lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone chemotherapy in the rituximab era.	This study analyzed the prognostic significance of soluble interleukin-2 receptor α (sIL-2Rα) levels in 100 prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. It showed that sIL-2Rα level ≥ 115 pmol/L at the time of treatment initiation correlated with a high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 (FLIPI-2), bulky disease, advanced clinical stage, number of involved lymph nodes, bone marrow involvement and elevated β2-microglobulin (B2M) level. When testing all patients, sIL-2Rα ≥ 115 pmol/L was associated with significantly shorter progression-free (PFS; p &lt; 0.03, hazard ratio [HR] 2.04) but not overall (OS; p = 0.06, HR 2.36) survival rates. Subanalysis of patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) ± rituximab showed higher predictive power for both PFS (HR 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-6.11, p = 0.01) and OS (HR 3.33, 95% CI 1.15-9.63, p = 0.02). In the whole population (n = 100), only B2M proved a significant univariate predictor (p = 0.007, HR = 2.8) of PFS. When testing patients treated with CHOP ± rituximab, sIL-2Rα was found to be the best univariate predictor for PFS among all FLIPI-2 factors (HR = 2.68, p = 0.015). Serum IL-2Rα levels may help to refine risk assessment in the modern immunotherapy era complementary to FLIPI-2 factors.	2016	03	22	Leuk Lymphoma	Procházka	Vít
24413734	10.1038/ng.2873	Recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators, RHOA and FYN kinase in peripheral T cell lymphomas.	Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12 tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples. Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition, we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PTCL. 	2014	03	25	Nat Genet	Palomero	Teresa
24441948	10.1007/s00277-014-2015-2	Prognostic impact of beta-2 microglobulin in patients with extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma.	Although serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been suggested as an independent prognostic factor for several lymphoproliferative diseases, it has rarely been investigated in extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). From a prospectively collected database, 145 patients with ENKTL were identified. Among them, a total of 101 patients were included in the analysis, with exclusion of patients without baseline serum B2M level and those did not receive anticancer therapy. Serum B2M (&lt;3.0 vs. ≥3.0 mg/L) was analyzed for association with overall survival (OS). Seventy-nine (78 %) patients had nasal ENKTL, and 22 (22 %) had extranasal ENKTL. In overall patients, median OS was 26.7 months (95 % confidence interval (CI), not assessable), with a median follow-up of 32.4 months (range, 0.9-155.2 months). While median OS was not reached in patients with nasal ENKTL, extranasal ENKTL group had median OS of 5.1 months (95 % CI, 1.2-8.9 months; p &lt; 0.001). Baseline serum B2M was significantly associated with OS in patients with nasal ENKTL (p &lt; 0.001). This was consistent in limited (stages I and II) nasal ENKTL (p = 0.002) and disseminated (stages III and IV) nasal ENKTL (p = 0.02). However, there was no difference of OS in extranasal ENKTL patients (p = 0.69). In multivariate analysis including other prognostic factors, elevated serum B2M was significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.8, 95 % CI 1.7-8.2, p = 0.001, in a model including Korean Prognostic Index, and HR = 3.6, 95 % CI 1.6-8.2, p = 0.002, in a model including International Prognostic Index). In patients with nasal ENKTL, baseline serum B2M is a powerful prognostic factor. The prognostic value of B2M was independent of previously established prognostic models. Further investigations are necessary to validate the role of B2M in ENKTL. 	2014	06	23	Ann Hematol	Yoo	Changhoon
24454777	10.1371/journal.pone.0084999	Correlations between functional imaging markers derived from PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.	To investigate the correlations between functional imaging markers derived from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Further to compare the usefulness of these tumor markers in differentiating diagnosis of the two common types of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Thirty-four consecutive pre-therapy adult patients with proven NHL (23 DLBCL and 11 FL) underwent PET/CT and MRI examinations and laboratory tests. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and metabolic tumor burden (MTB) were determined from the PET/CT images. DWI was performed in addition to conventional MRI sequences using two b values (0 and 800 s/mm(2)). The minimum and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(min) and ADC(mean)) were measured on the parametric ADC maps. The SUV(max) correlated inversely with the ADC(min) (r = -0.35, p&lt;0.05). The ADC(min), ADC(mean), serum thymidine kinase (TK), Beta 2-microglobulin (B2m), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and C-reactive protein (CRP) correlated with both whole-body MTV and whole-body MTB (p&lt;0.05 or 0.01). The SUV(max), TK, LD, and CRP were significantly higher in the DLBCL group than in the FL group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that they were reasonable predictors in differentiating DLBCL from FL. The functional imaging markers determined from PET/CT and DWI are associated, and the SUV(max) is superior to the ADC(min) in differentiating DLBCL from FL. All the measured serum markers are associated with functional imaging markers. Serum LD, TK, and CRP are useful in differentiating DLBCL from FL.	2014	12	28	PLoS One	Wu	Xingchen
24885312	10.1186/1471-2164-15-390	In silico analyses reveal common cellular pathways affected by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in the lymphomagenesis of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).	The analysis of cellular networks and pathways involved in oncogenesis has increased our knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie tumour biology and has unmasked new molecular targets that may lead to the design of better anti-cancer therapies. Recently, using a high resolution loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, we identified a number of potential tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) within common LOH regions across cases suffering from two of the most common forms of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). From these studies LOH of the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) gene was identified as a common event in the lymphomagenesis of these B-cell lymphomas. The present study aimed to determine the cellular pathways affected by the inactivation of these TSGs including PTPRJ in FL and DLBCL tumourigenesis. Pathway analytical approaches identified that candidate TSGs located within common LOH regions participate within cellular pathways, which may play a crucial role in FL and DLBCL lymphomagenesis (i.e., metabolic pathways). These analyses also identified genes within the interactome of PTPRJ (i.e. PTPN11 and B2M) that when inactivated in NHL may play an important role in tumourigenesis. We also detected genes that are differentially expressed in cases with and without LOH of PTPRJ, such as NFATC3 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 3). Moreover, upregulation of the VEGF, MAPK and ERBB signalling pathways was also observed in NHL cases with LOH of PTPRJ, indicating that LOH-driving events causing inactivation of PTPRJ, apart from possibly inducing a constitutive activation of these pathways by reduction or abrogation of its dephosphorylation activity, may also induce upregulation of these pathways when inactivated. This finding implicates these pathways in the lymphomagenesis and progression of FL and DLBCL. The evidence obtained in this research supports findings suggesting that FL and DLBCL share common pathogenic mechanisms. Also, it indicates that PTPRJ can play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these B-cell tumours and suggests that activation of PTPRJ might be an interesting novel chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of these B-cell tumours.	2015	01	16	BMC Genomics	Aya-Bonilla	Carlos
24969158	10.1159/000362670	Prognostic significance of serum beta-2 microglobulin in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	Elevated serum beta-2 microglobulin (β2-M) has previously been reported in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. This study examined the association between serum β2-M and the prognosis of NHL and analyzed its predictive value. A total of 287 NHL patients from Taiyuan, Shanxi, China, participated in a prospective cohort study between 2008 and 2011. Overall survival (OS) was compared between NHL patients with high and normal β2-M levels using the log-rank test. Three standard Cox regression models including the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, β2-M or IPI score+β2-M as independent variables were constructed. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves method and C index were used to examine the tendency of the models' predictive accuracy over time. NHL patients with elevated β2-M values had worse OS (p&lt;0.001) and higher mortality risk (HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.77, p&lt;0.001) than patients with normal β2-M values. There were statistically significant differences between the C indexes for the models with IPI+β2-M, IPI or β2-M alone (p&lt;0.001). Our results demonstrated an association between serum β2-M and NHL prognosis. Combining β2-M with IPI may help to improve the prognostic accuracy of NHL.	2014	09	03	Oncology	Wu	Li
25171927	10.1182/blood-2013-12-546309	Exome sequencing reveals novel mutation targets in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas derived from Chinese patients.	Next-generation sequencing studies on diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) have revealed novel targets of genetic aberrations but also high intercohort heterogeneity. Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of disease subgroups and cytogenetic profiles differ between Western and Asian patients. To characterize the coding genome of Chinese DLBCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA derived from 31 tumors and respective peripheral blood samples. The mutation prevalence of B2M, CD70, DTX1, LYN, TMSB4X, and UBE2A was investigated in an additional 105 tumor samples. We discovered 11 novel targets of recurrent mutations in DLBCL that included functionally relevant genes such as LYN and TMSB4X. Additional genes were found mutated at high frequency (≥10%) in the Chinese cohort including DTX1, which was the most prevalent mutation target in the Notch pathway. We furthermore demonstrated that mutations in DTX1 impair its function as a negative regulator of Notch. Novel and previous unappreciated targets of somatic mutations in DLBCL identified in this study support the existence of additional/alternative tumorigenic pathways in these tumors. The observed differences with previous reports might be explained by the genetic heterogeneity of DLBCL, the germline genetic makeup of Chinese individuals, and/or exposure to distinct etiological agents. 	2014	12	29	Blood	de Miranda	Noel F C C
25292288	10.1186/1471-2407-14-750	Characterization of β2-microglobulin expression in different types of breast cancer.	Βeta-2-microglobulin (β2-M) has been demonstrated as a growth factor and signaling molecule in breast cancer and leukemia. The purpose of the study is to characterize β2-M expression in molecular subtypes of breast cancer, thereby investigating the mechanism of β2-M action in breast cancer. β2-M and B-Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) transcript expression levels in breast cancer tissue and the corresponding normal tissue were quantified using real-time PCR. The protein expression levels of β2-M, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), tumor protein 53 (p53) and Ki67 were determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Following silencing of the β2-M by siRNA, the levels of Bcl-2, ER, PR and HER-2 transcripts and the protein expression levels in human breast cancer cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. The expression of β2-M transcripts demonstrated no significant differences between the four breast cancer molecular subtypes and no significant correlations with age, clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. β2-M transcript expression demonstrated a positive correlation when compared to Bcl-2 transcript expression (P&lt;0.05). The β2-M protein expression was significantly higher in breast cancer when compared with benign breast tumors (P&lt;0.01), and have no significant correlation with age, clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. There was a significant difference demonstrated in β2-M protein expression in the four breast cancer molecular subtypes (P&lt;0.05), and between the ER+ and ER- groups (P&lt;0.01); however, no significant difference was demonstrated between the HER-2+ and HER-2- groups. β2-M protein expression had a negative correlation with ER protein expression (P&lt;0.01), a positive correlation with p53 protein expression (P&lt;0.01), and no correlation with Ki67 protein expression. β2-M silencing significantly inhibited Bcl-2 mRNA expression, but did not inhibit ER, PR and HER-2 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells (ER+, PR+ and HER-2-). In addition, Bcl-2 and HER-2 mRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells (ER-, PR- and HER-2-), which is consistent with the silencing effect seen at the protein level. β2-M expression demonstrated a significant difference in the four breast cancer molecular subtypes, and may be related to apoptosis regulation in breast cancer.	2015	05	28	BMC Cancer	Li	Kesheng
23331211	10.1111/ejh.12075	Prognostic significance of programmed cell death-1-positive cells in follicular lymphoma patients may alter in the rituximab era.	Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is involved in one of the inhibitory pathways of the B7-cluster of differentiation (CD) 28 family; this pathway is known to be involved in the attenuation of T-cell responses and promotion of T-cell tolerance. PD-1 is known to negatively regulate T-cell receptor-mediated proliferation and cytokine production, lead to alternation in the tumor microenvironment. Although several studies have shown that high levels of PD-1-positive cells in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients influence their prognosis, those studies included patients treated without rituximab, and the prognostic impact of PD-1 positivity in the rituximab era (R-era) has not yet been elucidated. We retrospectively studied 82 patients with FL uniformly treated with standard R-CHOP therapy at six institutions between 2001 and 2009 (median follow-up for survivors: 55 months). We also collected and examined biopsy specimens for diagnosis with respect to PD-1 positivity. The PD-1 positivity was significantly higher in male patients and patients with high beta-2 microglobulin (B2M ≥ 3.0) (P = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively). Three-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 60% and 86%, respectively. By univariate analysis, elevated LDH (P = 0.07) worsened PFS. Male gender (P = 0.03), high FLIPI score (P = 0.05), and high B2M levels (P = 0.08) worsened OS. Multivariate analysis detected no significant prognostic factors, including PD-1 positivity. However, in male subgroup, high levels of PD-1-positive cells were found to be a prognostic factor for PFS. Addition of rituximab might have altered the prognostic impact of PD-1-positive cells.	2013	05	07	Eur J Haematol	Takahashi	Hiroyuki
23717383	10.1371/journal.pone.0059868	Serum levels of beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins are associated with systemic disease activity in primary Sjögren's syndrome. Data at enrollment in the prospective ASSESS cohort.	To analyze the clinical and immunological characteristics at enrollment in a large prospective cohort of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and to investigate the association between serum BAFF, beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins and systemic disease activity at enrollment. Three hundred and ninety five patients with pSS according to American-European Consensus Criteria were included from fifteen centers of Rheumatology and Internal Medicine in the ""Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution of Sjögren's Syndrome"" (ASSESS) 5-year prospective cohort. At enrollment, serum markers were assessed as well as activity of the disease measured with the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI). Patient median age was 58 (25(th)-75(th): 51-67) and median disease duration was 5 (2-9) years. Median ESSDAI at enrollment was 2 (0-7) with 30.9% of patients having features of systemic involvement. Patients with elevated BAFF, beta2-microglobulin and kappa, lambda FLCS had higher ESSDAI scores at enrollment (4 [2]-[11] vs 2 [0-7], P = 0.03; 4 [1]-[11] vs 2 [0-7], P&lt; 0.0001); 4 [2]-[10] vs 2 [0-6.6], P&lt; 0.0001 and 4 [2-8.2] vs 2 [0-7.0], P = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, increased beta2-microglobulin, kappa and lambda FLCs were associated with a higher ESSDAI score. Median BAFF and beta2-microglobulin were higher in the 16 patients with history of lymphoma (1173.3(873.1-3665.5) vs 898.9 (715.9-1187.2) pg/ml, P = 0.01 and 2.6 (2.2-2.9) vs 2.1 (1.8-2.6) mg/l, P = 0.04, respectively). In pSS, higher levels of beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins are associated with increased systemic disease activity.	2014	02	18	PLoS One	Gottenberg	Jacques-Eric
23859015	10.1139/bcb-2012-0110	Low expression of dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin-related protein in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and significant correlations with lactic acid dehydrogenase and β2-microglobulin.	Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin-related protein (DC-SIGNR), a type II integral membrane protein and a member of the C-type lectins, has been reported to bind various strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. Serum DC-SIGNR is not currently available for the detection of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we assessed the serum levels of DC-SIGNR in 70 cancer patients and 100 healthy controls. Additionally, using immunohistochemistry, we determined the expression of DC-SIGNR in the lymph nodes. Using the ELISA, low serum levels of DC-SIGNR were detected in the patients (median, 4.513 ng·L(-1); range, 1.066-9.232 ng·L(-1); p = 0.0003). Serum concentrations of DC-SIGNR correlated significantly with age (p = 0.0077) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (p = 0.0046) and β2-microglobulin (p = 0.0491) levels. However, we found no statistically significant correlation between serum DC-SIGNR levels and clinical data such as sex, Ann Arbor stage, B symptoms, and histologic subtypes. Moreover, NHL patients with a lower level of serum DC-SIGNR expression in lymphatic endothelial cells also showed negative immunostaining levels. These results suggest that DC-SIGNR is a biological molecule that may be potentially useful in NHL clinical settings. 	2013	12	31	Biochem Cell Biol	Zhang	Zhuqing
23898101		Beta-2 microglobulin as a diagnostic parameter in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a comparative study with FDG-PET.	The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the serum tumor marker beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) as well as positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in confirming or eliminating the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Retrospective analysis of 180 patients with NHL referred for a PET scan was performed. Patients' data regarding demographic information, clinical history, and diagnostic procedures were collected. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value of serum β2M levels and FDG-PET, compared to a compound gold standard consisting of imaging modalities (computed tomography, magnetic resonance tomography, ultrasound) and/or biopsy, were assessed and compared. β2M had a sensitivity and specificity of 49% and 52% for all types and settings, respectively, as well as a low positive predictive value (66%) and a very low negative predictive value (36%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for all types of NHL in all settings was 87% and 92%, respectively. Due to its low sensitivity and specificity, β2M cannot be used in the clinical routine as a diagnostic marker for the diagnosis of NHL. On the other hand, in accordance with previous studies, we found that FDG-PET is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of NHL.	2013	10	17	Anticancer Res	Toth	Daniel F
22373550	10.1007/s00277-012-1434-1	Serum beta2-microglobin is a predictor of prognosis in patients with upper aerodigestive tract NK/T-cell lymphoma.	Upper aerodigestive tract natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (UNKTL) is the most common type of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Serum beta2-microglobulin (β2-M) was found to be a predictor in some subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. However, its prognostic significance in NK/T-cell lymphoma has never been explored. We retrospectively analyzed 82 patients newly diagnosed as UNKTL. Serum β2-M was detected prior to treatment in this series. Various statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the significance of the relevant clinical parameters. High serum β2-M level was calculated as ≥2.5 mg/L by the median value. The number of patients with serum β2-M ≥2.5 mg/L at diagnosis was 39 (47.6%) and 43 patients (52.4%) with β2-M &lt;2.5 mg/L. Patients with high serum β2-M level at diagnosis seemed to have more adverse clinical features: B symptoms (p=0.007) and elevated LDH level (p&lt;0.001), and high KPI score (p=0.002). Serum β2-M ≥2.5 mg/L was significantly associated with poor overall survival (5-year OS, 35.2% vs 73.6%; p=0.001) and progression-free survival (5-year PFS, 27.5% vs 55.9%; p=0.028). For patients with early stage, serum β2-M at diagnosis could also help to distinguish those with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. In multivariate analysis, high serum β2-M level remained its prognostic impact on survival (OS: p=0.002; PFS: p=0.039), independent of the International Prognostic Index score. Our study suggested high serum β2-M was a novel predictor of prognosis in patients with UNKTL. A simply and regular way might be established to identify UNKTL patients of different risks at diagnosis.	2012	09	17	Ann Hematol	Li	Zhi-Ming
22475215	10.3109/10428194.2012.666662	Association of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 with poor prognosis in elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	In population studies, the relative survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) decreases with age. In this study, we demonstrated in a cohort of 189 patients from a CLL clinic that overall survival was lower in the sub-cohort of patients aged ≥ 70 years, but causes of death were similar for all age groups, being progressive CLL, secondary malignancies and infections. As normal individuals age, the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, can increase. In our patients with CLL, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels increased with age to a greater degree than in normal individuals, and the levels correlated closely with plasma β(2)-microglobulin and with one another. In addition, in patients ≥ 70 years, IL-6 was found to be a better prognostic marker than immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IgV(H)) status. In vitro studies demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-8 could enhance the binding of CLL cells to stromal cells, suggesting that their clinical activity may be mediated through their effects on the microenvironment. Thus, plasma IL-6 is an important prognostic marker for the elderly with CLL, and this study highlights that the utility of prognostic markers may depend on patient age.	2013	01	04	Leuk Lymphoma	Yoon	Ju-Yoon

23033288		Significance of tumor burden, vascular endothelial growth factor, lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin serum levels in advanced diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) are incorporated in the so-called ""serologic staging system"", as independent parameters for predicting time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. Elevated values of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF) was associated with poor survival in the largest histological subgroup, the diffuse large B cell (DLBCL) and immunoblastic lymphomas. sVEGF has independent influence on survival in multivariate models when tested together with the components of the International Prognostic Index (IPI). The purpose of this study was to define possible correlations between LDH, B2M levels and the novel prognostic parameter sVEGF, with assessed tumor burden, as another parameter of aggressiveness for advanced-stage DLBCLs. Serum samples were collected from 29 patients with DLBCL, Ann Arbor clinical stages III and IV, to measure pretreatment serum levels of LDH, B2M and sVEGF. Tumor burden was defined as low and high according to criteria's defined by Jagannath and colleagues. A trend toward significant correlation between high initial levels of sVEGF and high tumor burden was observed (p=0.077). High serum LDH level was strongly associated with high tumor burden (p=0.0091), but B2M correlation with either low or high tumor burden was not confirmed (p=0.249). Complete response (CR) rates (CR vs. non CR) and OS according to tumor burden (low vs. high) showed no statistically significant differences (p=0.245 and p=0.202). Our preliminary data confirmed association between serum LDH level and DLBCL burden with a satisfactory sensitivity-specificity relationship. The other two parameters, sVEGF and B2M, failed to demonstrate significant relationship with tumor burden.	2012	11	21	J BUON	Milanovic	N
23226803	10.3892/ol.2012.913	Detection of the Epstein-Barr virus in blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not associated with prognosis.	The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a large spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases. Traditional methods of EBV detection include the immunohistochemical identification of viral proteins and DNA probes to the viral genome in tumoral tissue. The present study explored the detection of the EBV genome, using the BALF5 gene, in the bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and related its presence to the clinical variables and risk factors. The results show that EBV detection in 21.5% of patients is not associated with age, gender, staging, B symptoms, international prognostic index scores or any analytical parameters, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β-2 microglobulin (B2M). The majority of patients were treated with R-CHOP-like (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone or an equivalent combination) and some with CHOP-like chemotherapy. Response rates [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] were not significantly different between EBV-negative and -positive cases, with 93.2 and 88.9%, respectively. The survival rate was also similar in the two groups, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 64.3 and 76.7%, respectively. However, when analyzing the treatment groups separately there was a trend in EBV-positive patients for a worse prognosis in patients treated with CHOP-like regimens that was not identified in patients treated with R-CHOP-like regimens. We conclude that EBV detection in the bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells of DLBC patients has the same frequency of EBV detection on tumoral lymphoma tissue but is not associated with the risk factors, response rate and survival in patients treated mainly with immunochemotherapy plus rituximab. These results also suggest that the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improves the prognosis associated with EBV detection in DLBCL.	2021	10	21	Oncol Lett	Marques	Herlander
20828817	10.1016/j.leukres.2010.08.006	Different prognostic factors for survival in acute and lymphomatous adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.	Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a clinically aggressive and heterogeneous entity; hence it is likely that different variants of ATLL have different prognostic factors. 95 patients with ATLL seen at our institution between 1987 and 2008 were included. Clinical data were compared, according to ATLL variant, using the Mann-Whitney and the Chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazard test were used for the univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. Median age was 61 years with male-to-female ratio of 1.07:1. Patients with acute ATLL were more likely to present with bone marrow, liver and spleen involvement, higher β2-microglobulin and lower albumin levels. Poor performance status, high IPI score, presence of B symptoms, high LDH and low albumin levels were associated with a worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL. High LDH, high β2-microglobulin and high PIT score were associated with worse survival in acute ATLL. In the multivariate analysis, low albumin level and presence of B symptoms were independent factors for worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL, and high β2-microglobulin level was independent factor for worse survival in acute ATLL. Aggressive ATLL variants have a distinct, almost mutually exclusive profile of prognostic factors.	2011	05	17	Leuk Res	Beltran	Brady
22137796	10.1016/j.ccr.2011.11.006	Combined genetic inactivation of β2-Microglobulin and CD58 reveals frequent escape from immune recognition in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the β2-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in &gt;60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.	2012	02	06	Cancer Cell	Challa-Malladi	Madhavi
20437868		Prognostic factors in follicular lymphoma: the importance of beta-2 microglobulin.	The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) is a useful tool for the prognostic assessment of follicular lymphoma but beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) was not incorporated in this index. We aimed to compare the predictive value of B2M, FLIPI and other prognostic factors not included in the FLIPI index for overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR), and time to treatment failure (TTF) in a nonselected follicular lymphoma series. Retrospective univariate and multivariate analysis of the prognostic value (for OS, CR, TTF) of B2M, FLIPI and other prognostic variables in follicular lymphoma was conducted in a cohort of follicular lymphoma patients between 1987 and 2007. One hundred and six patients were studied. In univariate analysis B2M and B symptoms were significantly associated with OS, and FLIPI only detected two risk levels. In multivariate analysis of OS only two significant variables were found: FLIPI and B2M. Multivariate analysis of CR showed that normal B2M, absence of a bulky mass, uninvolved bone marrow, and chemotherapy with rituximab were significant predictors of CR. FLIPI (three levels), B2M, bone marrow infiltration, and chemotherapy with rituximab were significantly associated with TTF. We found a high predictive value of B2M for OS, CR, and TTF. B2M and FLIPI were the most important variables to predict OS. However, in our series FLIPI differentiated only between two mortality risk levels.	2010	05	14	Tumori	Cánovas	Araceli
20629733	10.1111/j.1600-0625.2010.01138.x	A novel xenograft model of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.	Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are characterized by accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. Early disease resembles benign skin disorders but during disease progression cutaneous tumors develop, and eventually the malignant T cells can spread to lymph nodes and internal organs. However, because of the lack of suitable animal models, little is known about the mechanisms driving CTCL development and progression in vivo. Here, we describe a novel xenograft model of tumor stage CTCL, where malignant T cells (MyLa2059) are transplanted to NOD/SCID-B2m(-/-) (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) B2m(tm1Unc) /J) mice. Subcutaneous transplantation of the malignant T cells led to rapid tumor formation in 43 of 48 transplantations, whereas transplantation of non-malignant T cells isolated from the same donor did not result in tumor development. Importantly, the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in mice treated with vorinostat when compared to mice treated with vehicle. Furthermore, in most mice the tumors displayed subcutaneous and/or lymphatic dissemination. Histological, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses confirmed that both tumors at the inoculation site, as well as distant subcutaneous and lymphatic tumors, originated from the transplanted malignant T cells. In conclusion, we describe a novel mouse model of tumor stage CTCL for future studies of disease dissemination and preclinical evaluations of new therapeutic strategies.	2011	04	19	Exp Dermatol	Krejsgaard	Thorbjørn
19265139	10.4049/jimmunol.0802316	Class I HLA folding and antigen presentation in beta 2-microglobulin-defective Daudi cells.	To present virus and tumor Ags, HLA class I molecules undergo a complex multistep assembly involving discrete but transient folding intermediates. The most extensive folding abnormalities occur in cells lacking the class I L chain subunit, called beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m). Herein, this issue was investigated taking advantage of eight conformational murine mAbs (including the prototypic W6/32 mAb) to mapped H chain epitopes of class I molecules, four human mAbs to class I alloantigens, as well as radioimmunoprecipitation, in vitro assembly, pulse-chase, flow cytometry, and peptide-pulse/ELISPOT experiments. We show that endogenous (HLA-A1, -A66, and -B58) as well as transfected (HLA-A2) heavy chains in beta(2)m-defective Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells are capable of being expressed on the cell surface, although at low levels, and exclusively as immature glycoforms. In addition, HLA-A2 is: 1) partially folded at crucial interfaces with beta(2)m, peptide Ag, and CD8; 2) receptive to exogenous peptide; and 3) capable of presenting exogenous peptide epitopes (from virus and tumor Ags) to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (bulk populations as well as clones) educated in a beta(2)m-positive environment. These experiments demonstrate a precursor-product relationship between novel HLA class I folding intermediates, and define a stepwise mechanism whereby distinct interfaces of the class I H chain undergo successive, ligand-induced folding adjustments in vitro as well as in vivo. Due to this unprecedented class I plasticity, Daudi is the first human cell line in which folding and function of class I HLA molecules are observed in the absence of beta(2)m. These findings bear potential implications for tumor immunotherapy.	2009	05	08	J Immunol	Martayan	Aline
19286254	10.1016/j.leukres.2009.02.015	Prognostic [corrected] significance of angiogenic/lymphangiogenic, anti-apoptotic, inflammatory and viral factors in 88 cases with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and review of the literature.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of Non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL). The outcome of these patients shows a wide variation. We evaluated the effect of six biologic parameters including Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), Survivin, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C (VEGF-C), Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and clinical parameters. A follow up study was conducted and 88 cases with DLBCL were included in the study. The data of 72 patients were eligible for the survival analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect these parameters. The ratio of positive cases for Cox-2, VEGF-A, Survivin, VEGF-C, EBV, TSP-1 were 71.6%, 64.8%, 60.2%, 36.4%, 21.6%, 14.8%, respectively. Survivin (+) cases showed higher LDH levels and VEGF-A (+) cases showed higher beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) levels compared with (-) cases. Mean survival rates were found to be significantly shorter in cases expressing VEGF-A, VEGF-C, EBV and Survivin than cases not expressing these. EBV expression (HR: 3.78; 95%CI: 1.47-9.74; p=0.006), VEGF-C expression (HR: 3.22; 95%CI: 1.07-9.68; p=0.037) and extranodal involvement (HR: 3.02; 95%CI: 1.01-8.97; p=0.047) were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis according to the Cox regression analysis. Lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C) and EBV related viral lymphomagenesis have been found to be related with prognosis in DLBCL patients.	2009	11	23	Leuk Res	Paydas	Semra
19874554	10.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02313.x	Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in children with Hodgkin's lymphoma.	The study was to determine clinical utility of serum soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2Ralpha), beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as markers of diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to therapy in childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The markers were measured prospectively before treatment and in complete remission (CR) during and after therapy in 30 children with HL (F/M:19/11; median age: 11.3 years) and once in 50 healthy children (F/M: 24/26; median age: 8.7 years). Median pretreatment levels of all analysed markers were significantly higher than in healthy controls. Increased pretreatment sIL-2Ralpha, LDH and ESR correlated with bulky disease; sIL-2Ralpha, beta(2)-M and ESR with presence of B symptoms and sIL-2Ralpha and LDH with advanced HL stages. There was a correlation between sIL-2Ralpha and LDH and between beta(2)-M and ESR. The levels and rates of elevated markers reflected well the response to chemotherapy, decreasing significantly when patients achieved CR and further on with therapy continuation. Since all patients survived thus the markers' value to predict the outcome was not established. Serum sIL-2Ralpha, beta(2)-M, LDH and ESR may act as markers for diagnostics and used in monitoring of therapy effectiveness in childhood HL. The markers were also increased in subgroups of patients with unfavourable clinical features; however, small sample size of the study did not allow to draw conclusion on their prognostic roles. We were also not able to establish the influence of markers on event free survival and overall survival because all children survived independent of initial clinical characteristics and pretreatment levels of sIL-2Ralpha, beta(2)-M, LDH and ESR.	2009	11	17	Scand J Immunol	Bien	E
18688847	10.1002/ijc.23772	Human acute leukemia cells injected in NOD/LtSz-scid/IL-2Rgamma null mice generate a faster and more efficient disease compared to other NOD/scid-related strains.	Transplantation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) primary cells and cell lines in different strains of immunodeficient mice has led to preclinical models extensively used to investigate acute leukemia stem cells, biology and drug sensitivity. We studied the engraftment kinetics of AML and ALL cell lines and primary cells in 3 strains of NOD.CB17-Prkdc(scid) (NOD/scid, NS)-related mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)B2m(tm1Unc)/J, abbreviated NOD/scid/beta2 null, NSB; and NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjll)/SzJ, abbreviated NOD/scid/IL-2Rgamma null, NSG). The engraftment of human malignant cells was investigated by means of clinicopathological criteria, flow cytometry, PCR and immunohistochemistry. In NSG mice, we observed a significantly faster development of leukemia-related symptoms and a higher percentage of leukemia cells in the blood, in the marrow and in the spleen. The leukemia-related angiogenic switch (measured as the number of circulating endothelial cells and progenitors) was faster in NSG compared to NS and NSB mice. These models will be instrumental to studies on leukemia-initiating stem cells, leukemia biology, preclinical treatment studies, and to obtain patient-specific preclinical models to design and investigate patient-tailored therapies.	2008	09	16	Int J Cancer	Agliano	Alice
17325847	10.1080/10428190601001904	An analysis of clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of single-agent thalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.	Given that the efficacy/safety of thalidomide for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma have not been well characterized in a randomized, controlled setting, an analysis of larger, single-agent trials was conducted. Nine trials met the following inclusion criteria: primary population of multiple myeloma; all patients relapsed or refractory; single-agent thalidomide; and sample size &gt; or =50. At median doses of 200 - 800 mg per day, the pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 28.2% (95% CI: 22.6 - 33.7%), including a complete response (CR) rate of 1.6% (95% CI: 0.3 - 2.9%) and partial response rate of 26.0% (95% CI: 20.1 - 32.0%). Response was typically based on M-protein reduction alone. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) incidence varied from 12 - 44%, possibly impacted by the short median follow-up (9 - 29 months). Pooled venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence was 2.7% (95% CI: 1.1 - 4.3%) and discontinuation due to intolerance (DDI) rate was 14.9% (95% CI: 12.0 - 17.7%). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and PN incidence were not pooled due to lack of reporting and trial heterogeneity. Prognostic factors identified included B2M (PFS) and advanced age (PFS and OS). Overall, thalidomide demonstrated an ORR approaching 30%, with low CR rate of 1.6% and VTE and DDI incidences of 3% and 15%, respectively.	2007	04	20	Leuk Lymphoma	Prince	H Miles
17499801	10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.007	Targeting beta2-microglobulin mediated signaling as a novel therapeutic approach for human renal cell carcinoma.	We previously reported that the biological functions of beta2-microglobulin include antigen presentation and oncogenic activity. In the current study we investigated the direct role of beta2-microglobulin in the regulation of human renal cell carcinoma cell growth and the possible apoptotic inducing effect of blocking the beta2-microglobulin signaling pathway using an anti-beta2-microglobulin neutralizing antibody. We examined the effects of recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein and anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody on renal cell carcinoma cell growth and apoptosis in vitro. To seek a molecular understanding of anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody induced apoptosis we analyzed alterations in the growth and survival signaling components in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-jun N-terminal kinase mediated pathways using corresponding kinase inhibitors in SN12C cells. Recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein increased the growth of the 3 human renal cell carcinoma cell lines SN12C, Caki-1 and ACHN in a dose and time dependent manner. Treatment of SN12C, Caki-1 and ACHN cells with an anti-beta2-microglobulin polyclonal antibody strongly suppressed the growth of these cells in vitro, also in a dose and time dependent manner. The addition of recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein or anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody increased or decreased, respectively, the anchorage independent growth of SN12C cells. The recombinant beta2-microglobulin protein accelerated cell growth via activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and induced the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter. However, treatment with anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody induced cell death by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and activating c-jun N-terminal kinase, resulting in the induction of phosphorylation of B-cell lymphoma 2 and decreased phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter, leading to apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that beta2-microglobulin has an important role in regulating the growth and survival of renal cell carcinoma cells and anti-beta2-microglobulin antibody offers a potential novel therapy for the treatment of human renal cell carcinoma.	2007	07	17	J Urol	Nomura	Takeo
18024396	10.3324/haematol.11502	Prognostic relevance of serum beta2 microglobulin in patients with follicular lymphoma treated with anthracycline-containing regimens. A GISL study.	Although serum beta2 microglobulin (beta2 M) is an easy parameter to measure, and over-expressed in a large number of lymphoproliferative diseases, its prognostic value has been largely underestimated. The present study examined the influence of beta2M levels on overall survival (OS) of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). The prognostic role of beta2M was evaluated in 236 patients with FL identified from the databases of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dei Linfomi (GISL) and treated with anthracycline-based regimens from 1993 to 2003. Elevated serum beta2M levels were found in 82 patients (35%). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, elevated beta2M levels were associated with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p=0.021), age (p=0.029), and number of involved nodal areas (p&lt;0.001). The percentage of elevated beta2M levels increased progressively with increasing FLIPI scores (17%, 38%, and 63% in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively). Five-year OS was 61% (95% CI, 47-73%) and 89% (95% CI, 82-93%) for patients with elevated vs normal beta2M levels respectively (p&lt;0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that beta2M level had an independent and stable prognostic value (HR=3.0; 95%CI, 1.6-5.7). In a multivariate analysis the impact of beta2M level on survival was independent of FLIPI score, with a HR of 2.94 (95% CI, 1.54-5.62). Our results demonstrate that in patients treated in the pre-rituximabera, beta2M level was an independent prognostic marker in addition to FLIPI score. We thus suggest that beta2M be routinely assessed and tested in future prognostic studies of FL patients treated with combination chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents.	2007	12	19	Haematologica	Federico	Massimo
16085553	10.1080/10428190500102845	Malignant pleural effusion of multiple myeloma: prognostic factors and outcome.	Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in multiple myeloma (MM) is rare. Approximately 80 cases have been reported. To delineate optimal treatment and prognostic variables in these patients, we reviewed 11 MM patients with MPE. MPE developed at median of 12 months from diagnosis of MM. All the patients had high-risk disease based on complex karyotypic abnormalities including deletions of chromosome-13 (n=9), elevated beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) (n=9), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (n=8), high plasma cell labeling index (n=5) or high LDH (n=5). A significant increase in B2M, LDH, and CRP was observed at the onset of MPE. The initial diagnosis of MPE was based on positive cytology (n=9), pleural fluid cIg/DNA (n=9) or pleural fluid cytogenetics (n=4). Pleural tissue infiltration was found on pleural biopsy and autopsy in one patient each. Systemic chemotherapy comprising dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin (DCEP) (n=7) and pleurodesis (n=7) were effective in resolving MPE but survival was short. High dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell support for MPE in six patients conferred no clear survival advantage. These patients died at median of four months from onset of MPE. Patients with bone marrow complex karyotypic abnormalities including deletion-13 (n=9) had a shorter (median--18 months) overall survival compared to patients with normal cytogenetics (median--38 months). MPE in patients with MM is often associated with high-risk disease including deletion 13 chromosomal abnormality and heralds a poor prognosis despite aggressive local and systemic treatment.	2006	04	24	Leuk Lymphoma	Kamble	R
12454016	10.1074/jbc.M208381200	A dominant negative mutant beta 2-microglobulin blocks the extracellular folding of a major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain.	The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC1) molecule plays a crucial role in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. beta 2-Microglobulin (beta 2m) has been demonstrated to be both a structural component of the MHC1 complex and a chaperone-like molecule for MHC1 folding. beta 2m binding to an isolated alpha 3 domain of MHC1 heavy chain at micromolar concentrations has been shown to accurately model the biochemistry and thermodynamics of beta 2m-driven MHC1 folding. These results suggested a model in which the chaperone-like role of beta 2m is dependent on initial binding to the alpha 3 domain interface of MHC1 with beta 2m. Such a model predicts that a mutant beta 2m molecule with an intact MHC1 alpha 3 domain interaction but a defective MHC1 alpha 1 alpha 2 domain interaction would block beta2m-driven folding of MHC1. In this study we generated such a beta 2m mutant and demonstrated that it blocks MHC1 folding by normal beta 2m at the expected micromolar concentrations. Our data support an initial interaction of beta 2m with the MHC1 alpha 3 domain in MHC1 folding. In addition, the dominant negative mutant beta 2m can block T-cell functional responses to antigenic peptide and MHC1.	2003	04	22	J Biol Chem	Hill	Dawn M
12471623	10.1002/ijc.10824	Beta2-microglobulin aberrations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the testis and the central nervous system.	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules are expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells and present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T cells, thereby playing an important role in initiating the cellular anti-tumor immune response. We previously reported that loss of HLA class I expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the central nervous system (CNS) and the testis is a common event. Loss of expression and mutations of the light chain of the HLA class I molecule, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) have been described in a variety of human tumors and cell lines. In our study, we screened 15 DLBCL cases with a combined loss of HLA class I and beta(2)m expression for mutations in the latter gene by direct sequencing. Frame shift mutations in repetitive sequences within the beta(2)m gene leading to loss of functional beta(2)m were detected in 2 cases. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for chromosome 15 exhibited loss of the remaining copy of the beta(2)m gene in both cases but also hemizygous deletions and monosomies in 6 additional cases. Since similar mutations in the beta(2)m gene have been associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), we used 8 markers to study MSI involvement in DLBCL. Low MSI was more frequent (33%) as compared to nodal DLBCL (n=15) but did not correlate with the beta(2)m mutations. Our data indicate that multiple mechanisms lead to downregulation of beta(2)m and concomitant loss of HLA class I expression in DLBCL.	2003	01	21	Int J Cancer	Jordanova	Ekaterina S
12759931	10.1002/gcc.10214	Evidence for whole chromosome 6 loss and duplication of the remaining chromosome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	HLA class I molecules serve the essential immunological function of presenting antigen to CD8+ T lymphocytes. Tumor cells may present tumor-specific antigen to T cells via these molecules, but many tumors show a loss or down-regulation of HLA class I expression and this may serve as an immune escape mechanism. Using a microsatellite marker-based method, we have searched for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations at 3 genomic regions implicated in HLA class I expression in a cohort of 56 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples. The regions analyzed consisted of the HLA class I heavy chain genes located within the MHC genomic region on chromosome arm 6p, the HLA class I light chain (beta-2-microglobulin, B2M) gene on chromosome arm 15q, and the putative HLA modifier of methylation gene (MEMO1) located on chromosome arm 1q. Results revealed low frequencies of B2M (2/55) and MEMO1 (5/42) LOH but a high frequency of MHC LOH (19/56) that was usually associated with whole chromosome 6 loss (13/19). Cytogenetic data were available for 30 samples, including nine of those that exhibited apparent whole chromosome 6 loss. No cases of chromosome 6 monosomy were observed. We propose that whole chromosome 6 loss with reduplication of the remaining chromosome is common in ALL and that it is driven by the presence of tumor-inhibiting factors on chromosome arm 6p (the HLA loci) along with previously localized tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome arm 6q.	2003	07	28	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	McEvoy	Christopher R E
12401828	10.1136/jcp.55.11.865	A reliable method for total RNA extraction from frozen human bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis of acute leukaemia.	This report describes a newly developed method using Trizol LS reagent that can reliably extract high quality total RNA from frozen human leukaemic bone marrow samples. Extraction of total RNA from 71 frozen leukaemic bone marrow samples obtained at the time of diagnosis produced a median yield of 145 micro g/ml leukaemic bone marrow. Total RNA samples could be reverse transcribed into cDNA and used successfully in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of B2M transcripts in 68 of 71 cases. A multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that significant predictors of RNA yield were both sample volume (&lt; 1 ml v &gt; 1 ml; p = 0.003) and peripheral blood white cell count (&lt; 5 x 10(9) v &gt;or= 5 x 10(9) white blood cells/litre; p = 0.011). The percentage of blasts present, leukaemia subtype, and sample storage period at -80 degrees C (up to 945 days) were not predictors of total RNA yield. This method of total RNA extraction should be of interest to diagnostic and research staff using frozen bone marrow samples for molecular analyses. Similarly, the lack of association between sample storage period at -80 degrees C and total RNA yield should be of interest to the administrators of tumour banks housing frozen bone marrow samples.	2002	12	17	J Clin Pathol	Barbaric	D
11712809		Beta-2-microglobulin levels in patients with extranodal B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type: a retrospective analysis.	Serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) have been reported as a predictor of clinical outcome, prognosis and tumor burden in patients with various types of lymphomas. In case of lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type, no clear data exist to define the role of B2M in terms of staging or prognosis. In a retrospective analysis we investigated the serum B2M-levels in patients suffering from histologically verified MALT-type lymphoma in correlation to stage and response to treatment. All patients admitted to our institution since 1996 with a diagnosis of MALT-type lymphoma were retrospectively evaluated for staging procedures and measurements of serum B2M levels. Patients with a staging work-up including otorhinolaryngologic evaluation, gastroscopy with multiple biopsies, endosonography of the upper GI-tract, enteroclysis, colonoscopy, CT of thorax and abdomen and bone marrow biopsy were analysed, while staging was performed according to the Ann Arbor system as modified by Musshoff. In addition, only patients with histologic samples amenable to re-assessment by a reference pathologist were included. A total of 68 patients with a diagnosis of MALT-type lymphoma were identified from our records. However, only in 32 patients exact staging according to our inclusion criteria had been performed and serum B2M-levels prior to the initiation of therapy were available in all these patients. Twenty-five patients; suffered from gastric lymphoma, while the remaining 7 patients had extragastric manifestations. In total, 13 out of 32 patients presented with stage I disease, 17 patients were rated as stage II and 2 patients suffered from stage III disease. Nineteen patients had elevated B2M-levels prior to therapy: 6 patients were rated as stage 1, II had stage II and two had stage III disease. Five patients still had elevated B2M-levels following treatment despite radiologically and histologically verified complete remission. In this series, no correlation between serum B2M levels, tumor burden and clinical outcome was apparent in patients with MALT-type lymphomas. While the number of patients with disseminated disease was small we could not demonstrate a difference for B2M-levels between stage I and stage II. While we cannot rule out that B2M might be different in patients with stage I/II disease as compared to more advanced disease, further investigations are necessary to determine the role of this marker in patients with MALT-type lymphoma.	2001	12	10	Anticancer Res	Penz	M Z
12004151		[Renal function in children after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)].	The aim of the study was to evaluate the renal function (on the basis of serum: cystatin C, creatinine, beta2-microglobulin(B2M) levels, creatinine and cystatin C clearance, and urine osmolality) in 37 children with ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) after completing intensive treatment (9 in course of maintenance therapy), depending on nephrotoxic antibiotics use (&lt;/=3 times vs &gt; 3 times) and methotrexate dose (1.0 g/m2 vs 5g/m2). The control group was formed by 15 healthy children. 1) Serum cystatin C, creatinine, beta2-microglobulin levels creatinine and cystatin C clearance, and urine osmolality were similar in the analysed and control groups. 2) We did not find any differences between the analyzed parameters in the groups of children: a) in maintenance therapy and after the end of the therapy, b) received methotrexate in the dose of 5.0 g/m2 vs 1.0 g/m2, c) not treated children and treated &lt;/= 3 times and gt; 3 times with nephrotoxic antibiotics.

The effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) exposures to human health has been widely debated. Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.	2000	06	09	Radiat Res	Morehouse	C A
9789607	10.1023/a:1008418727472	Peripheral T-cell lymphomas: initial features, natural history, and prognostic factors in a series of 174 patients diagnosed according to the R.E.A.L. Classification.	Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) account for about 10% of all lymphomas in Western countries. The aim of the present study is to analyze the initial characteristics and prognostic factors in a large series of PTCL patients. 174 patients (105 male/69 female; median age 61 years) were diagnosed with PTCL according to the R.E.A.L. Classification in nine Spanish institutions between 1985 and 1996. Cutaneous lymphomas and T-cell chronic lymphocytic/prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of the main initial variables. The distribution according to histology subgroup was: PTCL unspecified, 95 cases (54.4%); anaplastic large-cell Ki-l-positive (ALCL), 30 cases (17%); angioimmunoblastic T cell, 22 cases (13%); angiocentric, 14 cases (8%); intestinal T cell, 12 cases (7%), and hepatosplenic gamma delta T cell, one case (0.6%). As compared to the other types, ALCL presented more frequently in ambulatory performance status, without extranodal involvement, in early stage, normal serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) level and low-risk international prognostic index (IPI). Most patients were treated with adriamycin-containing regimens. The overall CR rate was 49% (69% for ALCL vs. 45% for other PTCL; P &lt; 0.02). The risk of relapse was 48% at four years. Median survival of the series was 22 months (65 months for ALCL vs. 20 months for other PTCL; P = 0.03), with a four-year probability of survival of 38% (95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 28-48). In the univariate analysis, in addition to the histology, older age, poor performance status, presence of B-symptoms, extranodal involvement, bone marrow infiltration, advanced Ann Arbor stage, high serum LDH, high serum B2M, and intermediate- or high-risk IPI were related to poor survival. In the multivariate analysis the histologic subgroup (ALCL vs. other PTCL) (P = 0.02; response rate (RR): 4.3), the presence of B-symptoms (P = 0.02, RR: 2.2), and the IPI (low vs. high) (P = 0.04, RR: 2) maintained independent predictive value. When the analysis was restricted to the unspecified subtype, only IPI had independent prognostic value (P = 0.003; RR: 3.5). PTCL have adverse prognostic features at diagnosis, respond poorly to therapy and have short survival, with no sustained remission. ALCL constitutes a subgroup which responds better to therapy and has a longer survival.	1999	02	12	Ann Oncol	López-Guillermo	A
9067691		Increased beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) is useful in the detection of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).	This study examines whether changes in beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) serum levels are useful in the early detection of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Serum B2M is monitored daily post-transplant at our center as a marker of change in lymphocyte activation. We identified 16 cases (16/1359; 1.2%) of PTLD from among 1359 kidney and kidney-pancreas transplants. Those with CNS lymphoma (two patients) and titer change only (one) were not included in this review. Thirteen patients had serum titer and clinical evidence of EBV activity; 12 of these patients had histological evidence of PTLD (lymph node 6, kidney 3, and generalized disease 3). Three patients died with disseminated PTLD infection. Nine are alive but only two have the original transplant kidney. All patients received quadruple immunosuppression for induction, and 11 were subsequently treated with OKT3 or ALG for rejection. The mean number of days of induction ALG therapy was 14.8 d (20 mg/kg/d). The mean number of days of OKT3 therapy for rejection was 14.4 d (5 mg/d). During rejection the highest mean creatinine level was 6.8 mg/dL, and the highest mean B2M level was 16.4. With PTLD, the highest mean creatinine level was 7.0 mg/dL and the highest mean B2M level was 32.3 mg/L. The difference in creatinine levels was not significant, but the difference in B2M levels was significant (p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that B2M levels are useful markers in differentiating rejection from PTLD.	1997	05	23	Clin Transplant	Sasaki	T M
8726404	10.3109/10428199209067605	Effects of alpha-interferon on serum beta-2-microglobulin.	Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) forms the small invariable light chain subunit of class I HLA antigens on the cell membrane of all nucleated cells. During the continuous turnover of the HLA molecules, B2M is shed from the cell membrane into blood. Lymphocytes are the main source of serum free B2M. Serum B2M concentration is increased in renal diseases, various malignant diseases and some inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. In lymphatic malignancies serum B2M has significant prognostic value. Interferons (IFNs) have the ability to enhance the expression of class I and II histocompatibility antigens. Accordingly, IFNs cause a rise in formation and release of B2M. Currently, treatment with IFN alpha is used in diseases, like multiple myeloma, where serum B2M measurements are used to assess tumor burden. We have measured serum B2M levels during IFN alpha treatment in patients with both multiple myeloma and chronic myeloproliferative diseases, and IFN alpha caused a significant increase in serum B2M. It can be concluded that use of IFN alpha abolishes the value of serum B2M as an indicator of disease activity.	1996	10	01	Leuk Lymphoma	Remes	K
8580834	10.3109/10428199509064927	Risk classification for large cell lymphoma using lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2 microglobulin, and thymidine kinase.	We have previously proposed a staging system for large cell lymphoma using the two serum markers beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). We recently tested this model in a different cohort of patients with large cell lymphoma and also examined the possible contribution of thymidine kinase (TK), a previously reported serologic prognostic factor. Using an inclusion criteria in the multivariate analysis for both forward and backward selection of p &lt; 0.15, only LDH, B2M, and TK were significant independent prognostic factors for both time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival. Inclusion of TK in the serologic model resulted in three significantly different risk groups for both TTF and survival. Corresponding endpoints at three years were: 1) good risk (no markers elevated, n = 43): 78%, 91%; 2) intermediate risk (1 or 2 markers elevated, n = 47): 41%, 36%; 3) poor risk (3 markers elevated, n = 11): 0%, 0%. This analysis extends the observation of the independent prognostic significance of B2M and LDH.

Eleven (50%) of 22 HIV-seropositive patients suffering from congenital coagulation defects and followed at the Hemophilia Center of Padua met the eligibility criteria for zidovudine (AZT) therapy. A 3-year clinical and laboratory follow up is described. Mean length of AZT treatment was 14.3 +/- 11 months. Three patients were enrolled at the latest stages (CDC stage IV) of HIV disease. They showed no clinical improvement after AZT administration and died with AIDS. One CDC stage III patient died from a high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) which suddenly developed 3 months after starting AZT. Seven patients began antiretroviral treatment when they were mild or asymptomatic for HIV infection (CDC stage II and III). None developed any sign of HIV disease progression on the basis of CDC criteria. Moreover, AZT administration induced an improvement of the humoral markers related to HIV disease, as CD4 T-lymphocyte count, serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) and, although only for few months, neopterin (Np) levels. A mild thrombocytopenia due to HIV infection was detected in 5 patients. In all cases AZT treatment was effective in increasing and/or normalizing the platelet count. Reduced daily dose AZT (600-500 mg/day) appeared to be well tolerated and of minimal toxicity as compared to the higher dose (1200 mg/day). In our study, the zidovudine-induced bone marrow suppression, namely severe anemia or pancytopenia, was the major side-effect limiting tolerance of the higher dose AZT.	1994	12	08	Haematologia (Budap)	Sartori	M T
1575009	10.1111/j.1600-0404.1992.tb04033.x	Cerebrospinal fluid beta-2-microglobulin in adult patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma: a useful marker in early diagnosis and monitoring of CNS-involvement.	Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from 18 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia or lymphoma in order to detect early central nervous system (CNS) involvement or relapse. Six had CNS-involvement documented by neurologic symptoms and tumor cells in the CSF. Their CSF-B2m-concentrations were significantly higher before intrathecal chemotherapy than in those without this complication (P less than 0.01). During therapy CSF-B2m levels fell rapidly to normal values on repeated measurements. The study demonstrates that serial determination of CSF-B2m alone may be a useful and sensitive marker of CNS-dissemination in acute leukemia and malignant lymphoma. Using the criteria of CSF-B2m greater than 160 nmol/l as a positive diagnostic test the sensitivity of the test was 100%, the specificity was 76%. The same values for the CSF/serum-ratio greater than 1 were 75% and 64%, respectively.	1992	06	04	Acta Neurol Scand	Hansen	P B
1627535	10.1111/j.1744-313x.1992.tb00053.x	Damage in B2m genes and DNA methylation of H-2 genes are involved in loss of expression of class I MHC products on the membrane of LR.4, a cell line derivative of the T-cell lymphoma L5178Y.	We have isolated an H-2 deficient cell line (LR.4) from the T-cell lymphoma L5178Y which grew without restrictions in the peritoneal cavity of different inbred strains of mice. The use of polyclonal anti-H-2 antiserum and complement indicated that LR.4 cells did not express class I determinants on the cell membrane. Southern blots of genomic DNA of LR.4 cells showed that B2m genes were severely damaged and that class I H-2 genes were extensively methylated. Consequently, LR.4 cells failed to transcribe mRNAs for both B2m and class I H-2 genes. On the other hand, specific immunity to LR.4 was demonstrated in C57BL/6J mice since, in subsequent challenges with either LR.4 or EL4.4, LR.4 did not grow, whereas EL4.4 grew and killed the mice. In C57BL/6J mice, rejection of LR.4 was accompanied by the production of cytotoxic antibodies. The immune response induced in C57BL/6J mice was determined by non-H-2 antigenic determinants in LR.4 cells.	1992	08	18	Eur J Immunogenet	Nava	G
2194155	10.3109/00313029009061421	Cerebrospinal fluid B2-microglobulin levels in meningeal involvement by malignancy.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum B2-microglobulin (B2m) levels were measured prospectively in 63 patients with hematological malignancies and 14 patients with solid tumours to evaluate the correlation between elevated levels and malignant infiltration of meninges. Serial CSF B2-m levels were also measured in 18 patients who received prophylactic intrathecal cytotoxic treatment. CSF B2-m levels were significantly higher in patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement than in those without (p less than 0.001). A CSF B2-m level greater than 1.80 mg/L was closely associated with CNS disease (specificity 96%, sensitivity 76%) and CNS infiltration was also likely when the CSF B2-m level exceeded a simultaneously drawn serum level (specificity 98%, sensitivity 46%). Intrathecal methotrexate prophylaxis resulted in a consistent and significant rise in CSF B2-m levels with an average increase of 96% during a course of intrathecal injections. These results suggest that CSF B2-m levels may not be helpful for predicting early CNS relapse in these patients. However the CSF B2-m level and the corresponding serum B2-m level is a useful adjunct to the cytological diagnosis of CNS involvement by malignancy at presentation. Its value in predicting early CNS relapse and documenting response to CNS treatment requires further clarification.	1990	08	08	Pathology	Jeffery	G M
2450918		Specific associations of fluorescent beta-2-microglobulin with cell surfaces. The affinity of different H-2 and HLA antigens for beta-2-microglobulin.	We prepared single-labeled FITC derivatives of beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) and examined their interactions with class I MHC Ag H chains on living cells. Human b2m was reacted with FITC under mild conditions and separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography into three peaks containing single labeled derivatives of b2m peaks A, B, and C, and a peak containing the unmodified protein. The three fluorescent derivatives labeled the surfaces of cells bearing class I MHC Ag. The labeling was specific for class I MHC Ag as indicated by failure to label cells in the presence of excess unlabeled b2m and failure to label the HLA-negative cell lines Daudi and 721.221. Mouse cells labeled with fluorescent human b2m were recognized by mAb to the class I MHC Ag and by virus-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suggesting that labeling with the fluorescent b2m does not significantly alter the structure of class I MHC Ag or impair their ability to present viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We determined the kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters for the fluorescent b2m derivatives associating with the class I H chains of mouse and human cells. Peaks B and C exhibited biphasic binding to the mouse lymphoma cells EL-4(G-CSA-) (Kd1 = 1 x 10(-9) M; K2 = 1.5 to 3.0 x 10(-8) M whereas peak A bound to a small number of low affinity binding sites. In contrast to the biphasic binding observed with EL-4(G-CSA-), only monophasic binding was observed for peak C binding to RDM4 cells. Biphasic binding was also observed with the human B cell line LCL 721. Analysis of a series of LCL 721 class I MHC loss mutants and gene transferents revealed that the heterogeneity in binding is due to differences in the affinity of different class I encoded H chains for b2m.	1988	04	26	J Immunol	Hochman	J H

The electrophoretically fast moving form of beta-2-microglobulin (alpha-B2m) was shown by crossed immunoelectrophoresis to be produced in vitro after incubation at room temperature and was not present in freshly drawn sera. A radioisotopic assay was developed to measure this conversion to alpha-B2m in sera from 14 healthy individuals and from 208 patients with benign and malignant disease. The activity was present in all the sera tested and the levels were significantly higher in sera from patients with small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and in childhood lymphomas when compared to the level in normal sera.	1988	12	22	Clin Chim Acta	Forbes	M A
3141196	10.1016/0277-5379(88)90218-0	Alteration of beta-2-microglobulin level in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases after a high dose of alpha-2-recombinant interferon.	A group of 10 patients with malignant lymphoproliferative diseases resistant to any standard therapeutical modalities were treated with a high dose of alpha-2-recombinant interferon (alpha-2-rIF). Alpha-2-rIF was administered at a total dose of 120 x 10(6) IU in a continuous infusion during 48 h. Two cycles of alpha-2-rIF immunotherapy were employed with an interval of 1 month in between each. Serum and urinary beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were examined prior to alpha-2-rIF application and on days 2, 4, 6 afterwards. Alpha-2-rIF treatment induced an increase in serum B2M as noted on day 2 followed by a decline to below the normal range. The initial increased value was significantly higher as compared to either the pretreatment value or the normal physiological range. The reduced B2M serum level was protracted and lasted until the second cycle of treatment. Similar but not so great changes in B2M serum values were noted during the second application of alpha-2-rIF. The changes of B2M level in the urine, although less convincing, mimic those observed in the serum. The present results confirmed the biological activity of alpha-2-rIF in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases.	1988	12	14	Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol	Opat	P
3285553		Serum beta 2-microglobulin in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders.	Beta 2-microglobulin (B2m) was measured on serum samples in 274 patients with acute and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (85 non-Hodgkin lymphomas-NHL, 30 Hodgkin lymphomas-HL, 34 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias-B-CLL, 8 Waldenström macroglobulinemias-WM, 76 multiple myelomas-MM, 31 acute lymphoblastic leukemias-ALL, 10 hairy cell leukemias-HCL). Two hundred and four patients were studied at the time of diagnosis, and results were correlated to clinical stage, and histologic subtype in NHL, immunoglobulin type in MM, and immunologic phenotype in ALL. Moreover, B2m was tested during and after chemo- and/or radiotherapy, and results were correlated to response, progression or relapse. Elevated pretreatment B2m values were found in widespread forms of NHL and HL, in patients with B symptoms and in the unfavorable histologic subgroups of NHL. Rapid falls in levels followed therapy institution. In B-CLL and in MM a close relationship between B2m and cell mass was found. A significant B2m level reduction followed treatment, whereas its increase could detect a relapse. In ALL, serum B2m was only slightly above the normal range. B2m seems to reflect the total burden of malignant cells mainly in MM and B-CLL; in other lymphoproliferative disorders it provides less prognostic information.	1988	06	23	Tumori	Melillo	L
11894933	10.1002/j.1460-2075.1983.tb01412.x	The beta2-microglobulin mRNA in human Daudi cells has a mutated initiation codon but is still inducible by interferon.	The human Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi does not synthesize beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and lacks the cell surface histocompatibility antigens. The cells, however, contain RNA hybridizing to a cloned human beta2m cDNA probe. cDNA from this Daudi beta2m RNA, was cloned and sequenced. By comparison with cDNA prepared from Ramos cells, which synthesized microglobulin, we determined the sequence of the 20 amino acid long leader peptide of pre-beta2m and show that in Daudi cells the initiator ATG has been mutated to ATC. Although Daudi beta2m RNA cannot be translated, interferon induces the beta2m RNA in Daudi cells as well as in normal human cells.	2002	04	08	EMBO J	Rosa	F

In order to discriminate between benign and malignant effusions, the value of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha 1-acidglycoprotein (AGP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), phosphohexose isomerase (PHI), and beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) has been estimated in serous effusions in a group of 106 patients, 30 with a malignant and 76 with a benign effusion. Mean CEA and AGP levels in malignant effusions were significantly higher than in benign effusions; no significant differences of mean PHI, AFP and B2M levels of benign and malignant effusions were found. CEA level estimations were useful for confirming malignancy in 27% of malignant effusions but in only 7.5% of all effusions, and AGP and PHI for excluding it in 37.5 and 36.0% of all effusions, respectively. With the combination of CEA with AGP or PHI, a correct diagnosis was achieved in only 45 and 44% of all effusions, respectively. The combination of AFP or B2M with CEA, AGP or PHI did not improve the discriminative value for differentiating malignant and benign effusions.	1982	12	03	Cancer	Martinez-Vea	A
6185038		Beta-2 microglobulin--an immunogenetic marker of inflammatory and malignant origin.	Major contributions have been made in the last few years to the knowledge of the structure, fate and cellular origin of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M); but the question of its function still remains unclear. The concept of B2M being simply a marker of renal physiology seems less satisfactory when reference is made to its relationship to the immunogenetic system. Although assay of B2M cannot be considered as a specific diagnostic tool, it still may be regarded as a useful parameter in monitoring inflammatory, malignant, and auto-immune disease activity.	1983	02	25	Ann Clin Lab Sci	Forman	D T

Serum levels were high in all cases, excepting for ALL which presented normal values in 81% of the patients. The follow-up of the microprotein was carried out in 17 patients with acute leukaemias. The data obtained seem to suggest that subjects with high serum levels of B2M at the beginning of the disease do not respond favourably to chemotherapy.	1980	07	12	Biomedicine	Schena	F P
7212634		The identification of testis-organizing H-Y antigen of man as hydrophobic polymers of a M.W. 18,000 subunit.	Mammalian testicular organogenesis initiated by male specific but ubiquitously expressed H-Y antigen can serve as the model of all other organogenesis. However, in order to understand the precise organizational role this plasma membrane antigen plays, it is essential to characterize H-Y antigen as a distinct molecular entity which would be extremely difficult if we have to deal directly with native H-Y antigen residing on the plasma membrane. Fortunately, we have previously found that in the mutational absence of H-Y antigen's proposed anchorage site, B2m (-), HLA (-) Daudi human male Burkitt lymphoma cells are incapable of stably maintaining H-Y antigen on their plasma membrane. B2m (-), HLA (-) Daudi human male Burkitt lymphoma cells excreted a group of several proteins that shared the three distinctive characteristics in common; their extreme hydrophobicity, their tendency beyond saturation to form irreversibly water insoluble aggregates by extensive interchain disulfide bridges, and their conspicuously slower turn over rates compared to other Daudi excreted proteins. After disruption of disulfide bridges, proteins of this group were resolved into at least seven distinct subunits of different molecular weights. M.W. 18,000 subunit of testis-organizing H-Y antigen was the smallest of the above. At the saturation, 0.7 to 0.9 microgram/ml of solubilized H-Y antigen uniformly assumed the form of very large aggregates of M.W. greater than 280,000. In more dilute solutions, however, the existence in much smaller trimeric and tetrameric forms of H-Y antigen was indicated. As these irreversibly water insoluble precipitates still retained H-Y antigenic determinants, they can be used in the future for the purification of H-Y antibody. When bound specifically to H-Y receptor sites residing on the plasma membrane of BFO cells, polymeric Daudi H-Y antigen apparently underwent the depolymerization process, thus, yielding the monomeric form of M.W. 18,000. It is likely that these six or more Daudi excreted proteins that shared the three distinct characteristics with testis-organizing H-Y antigen are also involved in various specific organogenesis.	1981	05	13	Ann Endocrinol (Paris)	Ohno	S
82455		Serial measurement of beta2 microglobulin, acute phase reactant proteins and the ESR in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.	Long-term observation of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas indicates they can be sub-divided into two groups with respect to changes in the plasma proteins. The first group has acute phase reactant proteins raised during active disease and sometimes a raised B2m, whilst in remission the protein profile is normal. The second group is typified by a chronic elevation of B2m and ESR but has normal C-RP levels. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia usually has a raised B2 m level and normal acute phase proteins, a subset with low B2 m is described.	1979	02	12	Biomedicine	Cooper	E H
15154230		[Immunologic phenomena in guinea pigs injected with homologous ganglia extracts].	Immunological modifications in guinea pigs injected with homologous lymph node extracts. In studies carried out in patients with lymphomas an accentuation of the B2M-globulin line was observed; occasionally paraproteins and isoantibodies were detected. For this reason the authors decided to find out whether the injection of homologous lymph node extracts in guinea pigs would produce serum, immunological and histological modifications comparable to the ones observed in the human being. A total of 100 guinea pigs were divided into 4 groups. Group 1, 50 untrated control animals; Group 2, 10 animals injected with complete Freunds adjuvant every 10 days, for 3 times, and sacrificed 7 days after the last injection; Group 3, 10 animals injected with the antigen prepared with the lymph nodes from normal guinea pigs, in the same way as the preceding group; Group 4, 30 animals injected with the same antigens emulsionated with the adjuvant, again by the same method as the 2 preceding groups. The antigen was prepared with the lymph nodes from normal guinea pigs. The cells were ""ultrasonicated"" and lyophilized; the lipids were extracted with chloroform. The extract thus obtained contained an average of 2 mg/ml of total proteins. A microimmunoelectrophoretic study (MIE) against rabbit immuno serum for guinea pigs anti-serum proteins, showed that it was contaminated with various serum proteins (fig. 1, A). In the 3 injected groups, most of the guinea pigs showed a 10% decrease in serum protein (Table). Using MIE there was a re-enforcement of the B2M-globulin precipitation line (IgM), in all the animals of groups 2 and 4, as compared to the groups 1 and 3 (Table and figure 1. B and C). Using microdiffusion in agar, the serum of 6% of the guinea pigs of group 4 gave precipitation lines with the homologous antigen (Table, figure 1, D). Using passive hemagglutination, between 30 and 40% of the serum of the animals of all 4 groups gave positive results with the same antigen, with a low titer (1/40). Using complement fixation, positive results were obtained with the lymph node antigen in 10% and 20% of the animals of groups 3 and 4 respectively: from 25 to 50% fixation with a titer of 1/10 (Table). Using immunofluorescence, positive images in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (from improntas of normal guinea pigs lymph nodes) were obtained only in the labeled gamma-globulin (IgG) of the animals of group 4 (Table and figure 2, C). Histological study of the lymph nodes of guinea pigs from groups 2 and 4 showed hyperplasia of the reticular tissue with apparent decrease in the size of the follicles. In some of the lymph nodes of the animals of group 4, giant cells were observed (Fig. 2, B), pironinophilic. In the group 3 hypertrophy of the lymphoid follicles was observed (fig. 2, A). Non-specific modifications of the serum proteins, similar to the ones observed in patients with lymphomas were detected in some of the animals belonging to groups 2 and 3 in a greater number of animals in group 4. Circulating isoantibodies could be compared to those detected in 2 cases of lymphosarcoma. In spite of definite histological alterations of the lymphatic organs, these cannot be compared with the alterations detected in the human being.	2004	09	07	Medicina (B Aires)	Bachmann	A E
34753803	10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-21-0208	MALT1 Is a Targetable Driver of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Claudin-Low, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	MALT1 is the effector protein of the CARMA/Bcl10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, a multiprotein complex that drives pro-inflammatory signaling pathways downstream of a diverse set of receptors. Although CBM activity is best known for its role in immune cells, emerging evidence suggests that it plays a key role in the pathogenesis of solid tumors, where it can be activated by selected G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of GPCRs implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis, specifically the receptors for Angiotensin II and thrombin (AT1R and PAR1), drove a strong epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in breast cancer cells that is characteristic of claudin-low, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In concert, MALT1 was activated in these cells and contributed to the dramatic EMT phenotypic changes through regulation of master EMT transcription factors including Snail and ZEB1. Importantly, blocking MALT1 signaling, through either siRNA-mediated depletion of MALT1 protein or pharmacologic inhibition of its activity, was effective at partially reversing the molecular and phenotypic indicators of EMT. Treatment of mice with mepazine, a pharmacologic MALT1 inhibitor, reduced growth of PAR1+, MDA-MB-231 xenografts and had an even more dramatic effect in reducing the burden of metastatic disease. These findings highlight MALT1 as an attractive therapeutic target for claudin-low TNBCs harboring overexpression of one or more selected GPCRs. This study nominates a GPCR/MALT1 signaling axis as a pathway that can be pharmaceutically targeted to abrogate EMT and metastatic progression in TNBC, an aggressive form of breast cancer that currently lacks targeted therapies.	2022	04	27	Mol Cancer Res	Lee	Jia-Ying Lloyd
34783281	10.1080/10428194.2021.1999444	Targeting MALT1 for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has an aggressive course and is associated with poor prognosis in the relapsed or refractory setting. ABC-DLBCL is characterized by chronic active signaling of NF-κB, which is dependent on the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. MALT1 is a key effector of the CBM complex and activates canonical NF-κB and AP-1 among other transcription factors <i>via</i> distinct protease and scaffold functions. There is therefore growing interest in therapeutic targeting of MALT1 for B-cell malignancies. Here, we review recent advances in therapeutic targeting of MALT1 for ABC-DLBCL. Covalent and allosteric MALT1 protease inhibitors have been developed which inhibit growth of ABC-DLBCL in preclinical models, and two clinical MALT1 protease inhibitors are being developed in phase I clinical trials. Importantly, these compounds can overcome resistance to BTK inhibitors in preclinical models. Alternative compounds blocking the scaffold effect of MALT1 are also in early preclinical development. Blockade of MALT1 protease activity may have important implications for anti-lymphoma immunity by increasing immunogenicity of ABC-DLBCL cells and also by potentiating anti-lymphoma activity of other immune cells in the lymphoma microenvironment. Together, early data suggest that MALT1 is a promising target for ABC-DLBCL and possibly other B-cell malignancies, and can have lymphoma cell-intrinsic as well as immune-mediated therapeutic effects.	2022	04	20	Leuk Lymphoma	Seshadri	Madhav R
34906687	10.1016/j.fsi.2021.12.009	BCL10 regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by activating MAPK-NF-κB/Rel signaling pathway in oysters.	B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) is an important member of the caspase recruitment domain-containing (CARD) protein family, which plays crucial roles in mediating the host inflammatory response. In the present study, a BCL10 homologue was identified from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (designed as CgBCL10). The full length cDNA of CgBCL10 was of 897 bp with an open reading frame of 522 bp encoding a polypeptide of 174 amino acids containing a classical CARD domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgBCL10 shared low similarity with the previously identified BCL10s from other species. In the phylogenetic tree, CgBCL10 was firstly clustered with CvBCL10 from Crassostrea virginica and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate BCL10s. The mRNA transcripts of CgBCL10 were highly expressed in gonad, gill, adductor muscle, and haemocytes. After Vibrio splendidus stimulation, the mRNA expression level of CgBCL10 in haemocytes increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) at 24, 72 and 96 h. In CgBCL10-RNAi oysters, the phosphorylation level of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in haemocytes were inhibited, and the mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines including CgIL17-1, CgIL17-2, CgIL17-3, CgIL17-6 and CgTNF all decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) at 12 h after V. splendidus stimulation. These results suggested that CgBCL10 regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines by activating MAPK kinase, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel and AP-1 to defense pathogen.	2022	02	25	Fish Shellfish Immunol	Zhang	Tong
35099607	10.1007/s00018-022-04154-z	A20 and ABIN-1 cooperate in balancing CBM complex-triggered NF-κB signaling in activated T cells.	T cell activation initiates protective adaptive immunity, but counterbalancing mechanisms are critical to prevent overshooting responses and to maintain immune homeostasis. The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex bridges T cell receptor engagement to NF-κB signaling and MALT1 protease activation. Here, we show that ABIN-1 is modulating the suppressive function of A20 in T cells. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified ABIN-1 as an interactor of the CBM signalosome in activated T cells. A20 and ABIN-1 counteract inducible activation of human primary CD4 and Jurkat T cells. While A20 overexpression is able to silence CBM complex-triggered NF-κB and MALT1 protease activation independent of ABIN-1, the negative regulatory function of ABIN-1 depends on A20. The suppressive function of A20 in T cells relies on ubiquitin binding through the C-terminal zinc finger (ZnF)4/7 motifs, but does not involve the deubiquitinating activity of the OTU domain. Our mechanistic studies reveal that the A20/ABIN-1 module is recruited to the CBM complex via A20 ZnF4/7 and that proteasomal degradation of A20 and ABIN-1 releases the CBM complex from the negative impact of both regulators. Ubiquitin binding to A20 ZnF4/7 promotes destructive K48-polyubiquitination to itself and to ABIN-1. Further, after prolonged T cell stimulation, ABIN-1 antagonizes MALT1-catalyzed cleavage of re-synthesized A20 and thereby diminishes sustained CBM complex signaling. Taken together, interdependent post-translational mechanisms are tightly controlling expression and activity of the A20/ABIN-1 silencing module and the cooperative action of both negative regulators is critical to balance CBM complex signaling and T cell activation.	2022	02	03	Cell Mol Life Sci	Yin	Hongli
35192832	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153990	Effects of gestational exposure to bisphenol A on the hepatic transcriptome and lipidome of rat dams: Intergenerational comparison of effects in the offspring.	Our previous studies demonstrated that prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure affected the hepatic transcriptome and lipidome in rat offspring in a sex- and age-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the effects of gestational exposure to BPA on the rat dams, after weaning period, and compared them with those of their offspring. Our results showed alterations in hepatic transcriptome related to insulin signaling, circadian rhythm, and infectious disease pathways in BPA-treated dams even 4 weeks after the exposure, whereas slight modifications on the lipid profile were found. Alterations in lipid and transcriptome profiles were more prominent in the prenatally BPA-exposed offspring at postnatal day (PND) 1 and 21 than those in the dams, suggesting that in utero exposure to BPA is more serious than exposure in the adulthood. Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (Ppard) were commonly altered in both dams and offspring. Nevertheless, the results of DIABLO (Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents), showed that multi-omics data successfully distinguished the exposed dams from the corresponding controls and their offspring with a high level of accuracy. The accuracy rates in BPA50 models (including control and 50 μg BPA/kg bw/day exposed groups) were smaller than those in BPA5000 models (control and 5000 μg BPA/kg bw/day exposed groups), suggesting dose-dependent severity in BPA effects. Palmitic acid and genes related to circadian rhythm, insulin responses, and lipid metabolism (e.g., 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (Agpat2), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), Cry1, Harvey rat sarcoma virus oncogene (Hras), and NLR family member X1 (Nlrx1)) were identified through DIABLO models as novel biomarkers of effects of BPA across two generations.	2022	05	04	Sci Total Environ	Nguyen	Hoa Thanh

Conversely it also acts as a paracaspase to cleave specified substrates. Because of its involvement in immunity, inflammation and cancer through its dual functions of scaffolding and catalytic activity, MALT1 is becoming a promising therapeutic target in B cell- and T cell-related diseases. There is growing evidence that the function of MALT1 is subtly modulated via post-translational modifications. This review summarized recent progress in relevant studies regarding the physiological and pathophysiological functions of MALT1, post-translational modifications of MALT1 and its role in B cell- and T cell- related diseases. In addition, the current available MALT1 inhibitors were also discussed.	2022	04	25	Biochem Pharmacol	Zhang	Yi-Yue
35230873	10.1126/scisignal.abk3083	Phosphorylation of serine-893 in CARD11 suppresses the formation and activity of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex in T and B cells.	CARD11 acts as a gatekeeper for adaptive immune responses after T cell or B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) ligation on lymphocytes. PKCθ/β-catalyzed phosphorylation of CARD11 promotes the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex and lymphocyte activation. Here, we demonstrated that PKCθ/β-dependent CARD11 phosphorylation also suppressed CARD11 functions in T or B cells. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis, we identified multiple constitutive and inducible CARD11 phosphorylation sites in T cells. We demonstrated that a single TCR- or BCR-inducible phosphorylation on Ser<sup>893</sup> in the carboxyl terminus of CARD11 prevented the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the kinase JNK, and the protease MALT1. Moreover, CARD11 Ser<sup>893</sup> phosphorylation sensitized BCR-addicted lymphoma cells to toxicity induced by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>893</sup> in CARD11 by PKCθ controlled the strength of CARD11 scaffolding by impairing the formation of the CBM complex. Thus, PKCθ simultaneously catalyzes both stimulatory and inhibitory CARD11 phosphorylation events, which shape the strength of CARD11 signaling in lymphocytes.	2022	03	31	Sci Signal	Kutzner	Kerstin
35255409	10.1016/j.jbior.2022.100890	CARD11 signaling in regulatory T cell development and function.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a critical subset of CD4 T cells that modulate the immune response to prevent autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. CARD11, a signaling hub and scaffold protein that links antigen receptor engagement to activation of NF-κB and other downstream signaling pathways, is essential for the development and function of thymic Tregs. Mouse models with deficiencies in CARD11 and CARD11-associated signaling components generally have Treg defects, but some mouse models develop overt autoimmunity and inflammatory disease whereas others do not. Inhibition of CARD11 signaling in Tregs within the tumor microenvironment can potentially promote anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we summarize evidence for the involvement of CARD11 signaling in Treg development and function and discuss key unanswered questions and future research opportunities.	2022	05	30	Adv Biol Regul	Carter	Nicole M
35406516	10.3390/cancers14071742	Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Treatment.	Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma (EMZL lymphoma) is an indolent B-cell lymphoma with a median age at diagnosis of about 60 years. It accounts for 7-8% of all B-cell lymphomas. It can occur in various extranodal sites, including stomach, lung, ocular adnexa, and skin; furthermore, the disseminated disease can be found in 25-50% of cases. Several infectious agents, such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. Pylori</i>) in the case of gastric Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma, can drive the pathogenesis of this cancer, through the autoantigenic stimulation of T cells, but there may also be other factors participating such autoimmune diseases. Initial staging should include total body computed tomography, bone marrow aspirate, and endoscopic investigation if indicated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), should be performed to detect the presence of specific chromosomal translocations involving the <i>MALT1</i> and <i>BCL10</i> genes, which leads to the activation of the <i>NF-κB</i> signaling pathway. Depending on the location and dissemination of the disease, different therapeutic choices may include targeted therapy against the etiopathogenetic agent, radiotherapy, immunochemotherapy, and biological drugs. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the complex biology and the diagnosis of this disease and to better define new treatment strategies.	2022	04	15	Cancers (Basel)	Di Rocco	Alice
35411950	10.1002/cbf.3702	USP7 sustains an active epigenetic program via stabilizing MLL2 and WDR5 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Activated B-cell-like (ABC)-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) is a common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor prognosis. The survival of ABC-DLBCL relies on constitutive activation of BCR signaling, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully addressed. By mining The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we found that the expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is significantly elevated in three cancer types including DLBCL. Interestingly, unlike germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL, ABC-DLBCL shows upregulated expression of USP7. Inhibiting the enzymatic activity of USP7 (P22077) has a drastic effect on ABC-DLBCL, but not GCB-DLBCL cells. Compared to GCB-DLBCL, ABC-DLBCL cells show transcriptional upregulation of multiple components of BCR-signaling. USP7 inhibition significantly reduces the expression of upregulated components of BCR signaling. Mechanistically, USP7 inhibition greatly reduces the methylation of histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me2), which is an epigenetic marker for active enhancers. USP7 inhibition greatly reduces the protein level of WDR5 and MLL2, key components of lysine-specific methyltransferase complex (complex of proteins associated with Set1 [COMPASS]). In ABC-DLBCL cells, USP7 stabilizes WDR5 and MLL2. In patients, the expression of USP7 is significantly associated with components of BCR signaling (LYN, SYK, BTK, PLCG2, PRKCB, MALT1, BCL10, and CARD11) and targets of BCR signaling (MYC and IRF4). In summary, we demonstrated an essential role of USP7 in ABC-DLBCL by organizing an oncogenic epigenetic program via stabilization of WDR5 and MLL2. Targeting USP7 might be a novel and efficient approach to treat patients with ABC-DLBCL and it might be better than targeting individual components such as BTK in BCR signaling.	2022	06	09	Cell Biochem Funct	Wu	Yuanyuan

35600392	10.3389/fonc.2022.881801	SOCS3 Acts as an Onco-immunological Biomarker With Value in Assessing the Tumor Microenvironment, Pathological Staging, Histological Subtypes, Therapeutic Effect, and Prognoses of Several Types of Cancer.	The suppressor of cytokine signaling (<i>SOCS</i>) family contains eight members, including <i>SOCS1-7</i> and <i>CIS</i>, and <i>SOCS3</i> has been shown to inhibit cytokine signal transduction in various signaling pathways. Although several studies have currently shown the correlations between <i>SOCS3</i> and several types of cancer, no pan-cancer analysis is available to date. We used various computational tools to explore the expression and pathogenic roles of <i>SOCS3</i> in several types of cancer, assessing its potential role in the pathogenesis of cancer, in tumor immune infiltration, tumor progression, immune evasion, therapeutic response, and prognostic. The results showed that <i>SOCS3</i> was downregulated in most The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer datasets but was highly expressed in brain tumors, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphoma. High <i>SOCS3</i> expression in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) were verified through immunohistochemical experiments. GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter were used, and this bioinformatics analysis showed that high <i>SOCS3</i> expression was associated with a poor prognosis in the majority of cancers, including LGG and GBM. Our analysis also indicated that <i>SOCS3</i> may be involved in tumor immune evasion <i>via</i> immune cell infiltration or T-cell exclusion across different types of cancer. In addition, <i>SOCS3</i> methylation was negatively correlated with <i>mRNA</i> expression levels, worse prognoses, and dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes in various types of cancer. Next, different analytical methods were used to select genes related to <i>SOCS3</i> gene alterations and carcinogenic characteristics, such as <i>STAT3</i>, <i>SNAI1</i>, <i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, <i>TK1</i>, <i>PGS1</i>, <i>BIRC5</i>, <i>TMC8</i>, and <i>AFMID</i>, and several biological functions were identified between them. We found that <i>SOCS3</i> was involved in cancer development primarily through the <i>JAK/STAT</i> signaling pathway and cytokine receptor activity. Furthermore, <i>SOCS3</i> expression levels were associated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy for numerous types of cancer. In conclusion, this study showed that <i>SOCS3</i> is an immune-oncogenic molecule that may possess value as a biomarker for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of several types of cancer in the future.	2022	07	16	Front Oncol	Dai	Lirui
35658124	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-1566	BCL10 Mutations Define Distinct Dependencies Guiding Precision Therapy for DLBCL.	Activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCL) have unfavorable outcomes and chronic activation of CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signal amplification complexes that form due to polymerization of BCL10 subunits, which is affected by recurrent somatic mutations in ABC-DLBCLs. Herein, we show that BCL10 mutants fall into at least two functionally distinct classes: missense mutations of the BCL10 CARD domain and truncation of its C-terminal tail. Truncating mutations abrogated a motif through which MALT1 inhibits BCL10 polymerization, trapping MALT1 in its activated filament-bound state. CARD missense mutations enhanced BCL10 filament formation, forming glutamine network structures that stabilize BCL10 filaments. Mutant forms of BCL10 were less dependent on upstream CARD11 activation and thus manifested resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10 truncating but not CARD mutants were hypersensitive to MALT1 inhibitors. Therefore, BCL10 mutations are potential biomarkers for BTK inhibitor resistance in ABC-DLBCL, and further precision can be achieved by selecting therapy based on specific biochemical effects of distinct mutation classes. ABC-DLBCLs feature frequent mutations of signaling mediators that converge on the CBM complex. We use structure-function approaches to reveal that BCL10 mutations fall into two distinct biochemical classes. Both classes confer resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10 truncations confer hyperresponsiveness to MALT1 inhibitors, providing a road map for precision therapies in ABC-DLBCLs.

35727133	10.7554/eLife.79826	A nucleation barrier spring-loads the CBM signalosome for binary activation.	Immune cells activate in binary, switch-like fashion via large protein assemblies known as signalosomes, but the molecular mechanism of the switch is not yet understood. Here, we employed an in-cell biophysical approach to dissect the assembly mechanism of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, which governs nuclear transcription factor-κB activation in both innate and adaptive immunity. We found that the switch consists of a sequence-encoded and deeply conserved nucleation barrier to ordered polymerization by the adaptor protein BCL10. The particular structure of the BCL10 polymers did not matter for activity. Using optogenetic tools and single-cell transcriptional reporters, we discovered that endogenous BCL10 is functionally supersaturated even in unstimulated human cells, and this results in a predetermined response to stimulation upon nucleation by activated CARD multimers. Our findings may inform on the progressive nature of age-associated inflammation, and suggest that signalosome structure has evolved via selection for kinetic rather than equilibrium properties of the proteins. The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defence against pathogens. Although innate immune cells do not recognize specific disease-causing agents, they can detect extremely low levels of harmful organisms or substances. In response, they activate signals that lead to inflammation, which tells other cells that there is an infection. Innate immune cells are turned on in a switch-like fashion, becoming active very quickly after interacting with a pathogen. This is due to the action of signalosomes, large complexes made up of several proteins that clump together to form long chains that activate the cell. But how do these large protein complexes assemble quick enough to create the switch-like activation observed in innate immune cells? To answer this question, Rodríguez Gama et al. focused on the CBM signalosome, which is involved in triggering inflammation through the activation of a protein called NF-kB. First, Rodríguez Gama et al. used genetic tools to determine that activating the CBM signalosome drives a switch-like activation of NF-kB in cells. This means that individual cells in a population either become fully activated or not at all in response to minute amounts of harmful substances. Once they had established this, Rodríguez Gama et al. wanted to know which protein in the CBM signalosome was responsible for the switch. They found that one of the proteins in the signalosome, called BCL10, has a ‘nucleation barrier’ encoded in its sequence. This means that it is very hard for BCL10 to start clumping together, but once it does, the clumps grow on their own. The nucleation barrier describes exactly how hard it is for these clumps to get started, and is determined by how disorganized the protein is. When a pathogen ‘stimulates’ an immune cell, a tiny template is formed that lowers the nucleation barrier so that BCL10 can then aggregate itself together, leading to the switch-like behaviour observed. The nucleation barrier allows there to be more than enough BCL10 present in the cell at all times – ready to clump together at a moment’s notice – and this permits the cell to detect very low levels of a pathogen. Rodríguez Gama et al. then tested whether BCL10 from other animals also has a nucleation barrier. They found that this feature is conserved from cnidarians, such as corals or jellyfish, to mammals, including humans. This suggests that the use of nucleation barriers to regulate innate immune signalling has existed for a long time throughout evolution. The work by Rodríguez Gama et al. broadens our understanding of how the innate immune system senses and responds to extremely low levels of pathogens. That BCL10 is always ready to clump together suggests it may be a driving force for chronic and age-associated inflammation. Additionally, the findings of Rodríguez Gama et al. also offer insights into how other signalosomes may become activated, and offer the possibility of new drugs aimed at modifying nucleation barriers.	2022	08	03	Elife	Rodriguez Gama	Alejandro
35750252	10.1016/j.clim.2022.109067	BCL10 loss-of-function novel mutation leading to atypical severe combined immunodeficiency.	Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by severe, early-onset infection in infants. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL) 10 defects causing SCID have been reported previously in two patients. A seven-month-old female infant was admitted with bilateral pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. She had a history of recurrent infections starting from four months of age. The patient was investigated for primary immunodeficiency. Immunological investigations revealed hypogammaglobulinemia with normal CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts, while a lymphocyte proliferation assay showed absent response to phytohemagglutinin stimulation, thereby establishing the diagnosis of an atypical form of SCID. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous mutation in the BCL10 gene, with both parents demonstrating a heterozygous state (NM_003921.5:c.271A &gt; C:p.[Thr91Pro]). The patient died before bone marrow transplantation due to severe disseminated adenovirus disease. We report the first patient from the Middle East with a novel homozygous mutation in the BCL10 gene causing SCID.	2022	08	09	Clin Immunol	Al-Tamemi	Salem

35981904	10.1016/j.jaci.2022.06.023	The role of the CBM complex in allergic inflammation and disease.	The caspase activation and recruitment domain-coiled-coil (CARD-CC) family of proteins-CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14-is collectively expressed across nearly all tissues of the body and is a crucial mediator of immunologic signaling as part of the CARD-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (CBM) complex. Dysfunction or dysregulation of CBM proteins has been linked to numerous clinical manifestations known as ""CBM-opathies."" The CBM-opathy spectrum encompasses diseases ranging from mucocutaneous fungal infections and psoriasis to combined immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative diseases; however, there is accumulating evidence that the CARD-CC family members also contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of allergic inflammation and allergic diseases. Here, we review the 4 CARD-CC paralogs, as well as B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1, and their individual and collective roles in the pathogenesis and progression of allergic inflammation and 4 major allergic diseases (allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis).	2022	08	18	J Allergy Clin Immunol	DeVore	Stanley B
36094731	10.1007/s12104-022-10105-3	Assignment of IVL-Methyl side chain of the ligand-free monomeric human MALT1 paracaspase-IgL<sub>3</sub> domain in solution.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein 1 (MALT1) plays a key role in adaptive immune responses by modulating specific intracellular signalling pathways that control the development and proliferation of both T and B cells. Dysfunction of these pathways is coupled to the progress of highly aggressive lymphoma as well as to potential development of an array of different immune disorders. In contrast to other signalling mediators, MALT1 is not only activated through the formation of the CBM complex together with the proteins CARMA1 and Bcl10, but also by acting as a protease that cleaves multiple substrates to promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival via the NF-κB signalling pathway. Herein, we present the partial <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C Ile/Val/Leu-Methyl resonance assignment of the monomeric apo form of the paracaspase-IgL<sub>3</sub> domain of human MALT1.

31595055	10.1038/s41423-019-0297-y	Bcl10 is required for the development and suppressive function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells.	Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in peripheral tolerance. Bcl10, acting as a scaffolding protein in the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex, has a critical role in TCR-induced signaling, leading to NF-κB activation and is required for T-cell activation. The role of Bcl10 in conventional T (Tconv) cells has been well characterized; however, the role of Bcl10 in the development of Treg cells and the maintenance of the suppressive function and identity of these cells has not been well characterized. In this study, we found that Bcl10 was required for not only the development but also the function of Treg cells. After deleting Bcl10 in T cells, we found that the development of Treg cells was significantly impaired. When Bcl10 was specifically deleted in mature Treg cells, the suppressive function of the Treg cells was impaired, leading to lethal autoimmunity in Bcl10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Foxp3<sup>cre</sup> mice. Consistently, in contrast to WT Treg cells, Bcl10-deficient Treg cells could not protect Rag1-deficient mice from T-cell transfer-induced colitis. Furthermore, Bcl10-deficient Treg cells downregulated the expression of a series of Treg-cell effector and suppressive genes and decreased effector Treg-cell populations. Moreover, Bcl10-deficient Treg cells were converted into IFNγ-producing proinflammatory cells with increased expression of the transcription factors T-bet and HIF-1α. Together, our study results provide genetic evidence, indicating that Bcl10 is required for the development and function of Treg cells.	2021	12	27	Cell Mol Immunol	Yang	Dandan
32790937	10.1111/febs.15522	Defining the combinatorial space of PKC::CARD-CC signal transduction nodes.	Signal transduction typically displays a so-called bow-tie topology: Multiple receptors lead to multiple cellular responses but the signals all pass through a narrow waist of central signaling nodes. One such signaling node for several inflammatory and oncogenic signaling pathways is the CARD-CC/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complexes, which get activated by protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-coiled-coil domain (CC) component. In humans, there are four CARD-CC family proteins (CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14) and 9 true PKC isozymes (α to ι). At this moment, less than a handful of PKC::CARD-CC relationships are known. In order to explore the biologically relevant combinatorial space out of all 36 potential permutations in this two-component signaling event, we made use of CARD10-deficient human embryonic kidney 293T cells for subsequent pairwise cotransfections of all CARD-CC family members and all activated PKCs. Upon analysis of NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, we could define specific PKC::CARD-CC relationships. Surprisingly, as many as 21 PKC::CARD-CC functional combinations were identified. CARD10 was responsive to most PKCs, while CARD14 was mainly activated by PKCδ. The CARD11 activation profile was most similar to that of CARD9. We also discovered the existence of mixed protein complexes between different CARD-CC proteins, which was shown to influence their PKC response profile. Finally, multiple PKCs were found to use a common phosphorylation site to activate CARD9, while additional phosphorylation sites contribute to CARD14 activation. Together, these data reveal the combinatorial space of PKC::CARD-CC signal transduction nodes, which will be valuable for future studies on the regulation of CBM signaling.	2021	07	20	FEBS J	Staal	Jens
32838054	10.1016/j.coemr.2020.07.011	Subcellular hot spots of GPCR signaling promote vascular inflammation.	G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest class of druggable targets. Signaling by GPCRs is initiated from subcellular hot spots including the plasma membrane, signalosomes, and endosomes to contribute to vascular inflammation. GPCR-G protein signaling at the plasma membrane causes endothelial barrier disruption and also cross-talks with growth factor receptors to promote proinflammatory signaling. A second surge of GPCR signaling is initiated by cytoplasmic NFκB activation mediated by β-arrestins and CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 signalosomes. Once internalized, ubiquitinated GPCRs initiate signaling from endosomes via assembly of the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase binding protein-1 (TAB1)-TAB2-p38 MAPK complex to promote vascular inflammation. Understanding the complexities of GPCR signaling is critical for development of new strategies to treat vascular inflammation such as that associated with COVID-19.	2021	03	17	Curr Opin Endocr Metab Res	Birch	Cierra A
32855441	10.1038/s41379-020-00660-2	Deciphering the genetic landscape of pulmonary lymphomas.	Pulmonary lymphoid malignancies comprise various entities, 80% of them are pulmonary marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (PMZL). So far, little is known about point mutations in primary pulmonary lymphomas. We characterized the genetic landscape of primary pulmonary lymphomas using a customized high-throughput sequencing gene panel covering 146 genes. Our cohort consisted of 28 PMZL, 14 primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) of the lung, 7 lymphomatoid granulomatoses (LyG), 5 mature small B-cell lymphomas and 16 cases of reactive lymphoid lesions. Mutations were detected in 22/28 evaluable PMZL (median 2 mutation/case); 14/14 DLBCL (median 3 mutations/case) and 4/7 LyG (1 mutation/case). PMZL showed higher prevalence for mutations in chromatin modifier-encoding genes (44% of mutant genes), while mutations in genes related to the NF-κB pathway were less common (24% of observed mutations). There was little overlap between mutations in PMZL and DLBCL. MALT1 rearrangements were more prevalent in PMZL than BCL10 aberrations, and both were absent in DLBCL. LyG were devoid of gene mutations associated with immune escape. The mutational landscape of PMZL differs from that of extranodal MZL of other locations and also from splenic MZL. Their landscape resembles more that of nodal MZL, which also show a predominance of mutations of chromatin modifiers. The different mutational composition of pulmonary DLBCL compared to PMZL suggests that the former probably do not present transformations. DLBCL bear more mutations/case and immune escape gene mutations compared to LyG, suggesting that EBV infection in LyG may substitute for mutations.	2021	10	22	Mod Pathol	Vela	Visar
32927162	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111272	Augmented autophagy suppresses thymocytes development via Bcl10/p-p65 pathway in prenatal nicotine exposed fetal mice.	Tobacco smoke is a common global environmental pollutant. Maternal tobacco smoke/nicotine exposure has long-term toxic effects on immune organs. We previously found that prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE)-induced programmed immune diseases caused by fetal thymic hypoplasia, but the mechanism still unknown. Autophagy has important functions in maintaining thymopoiesis, whether autophagy was involved in PNE-inhibited fetal thymocytes development is also obscure. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how nicotine changed the development of fetal thymocytes from the perspective of autophagy in vivo and in vitro. PNE model was established by 3 mg/kg nicotine administration in Balb/c mice from gestational day 9 to 18. The results showed that PNE reduced the percentage and absolute number of CD69<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>SP cells, suggesting a block of fetal thymocytes mature. PNE promoted autophagosome formation, autophagy related proteins (Beclin1, LC3I/II) expression, and upregulated α7 nAChR as well as AMPK phosphorylation in fetal thymus. Moreover, PNE promoted Bcl10 degradation via autophagy-mediated proteolysis and inhibited p65 activation, blocking the transition of thymocytes between the DP to SP stage. Further, primary thymocytes were treated with nicotine in vitro and showed induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, nicotine-inhibited CD69<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>SP cells and the Bcl10/p-p65 pathway have been reversed by an autophagy inhibitor. The α7 nAChR specific antagonist abrogated nicotine-induced AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy initiation. In conclusion, our findings showed that PNE repressed the Bcl10/p-p65 development pathway of CD4<sup>+</sup>SP cells by triggering autophagy, and illuminated the developmental origin mechanism of programmed immune diseases in PNE offspring.	2020	12	04	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Yan	Hui-Yi

Increasing evidence has supported the crucial role of CARD14 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, whereas the precise cellular signaling involved in skin physiopathology remains poorly understood. In this article, we show that neither genetic ablation of <i>Il17a</i> nor elimination of T cells was sufficient to restrain the skin inflammation in a CARD14-E138A-mutation-induced psoriasis-like mouse model, whereas depletion of <i>Il23</i>, which extremely blocked the IL-23/T17 axis, was more effective. Targeting CBM complex by conditional deletion of MALT1 or BCL10 in keratinocytes abrogated both the cutaneous and systemic inflammation of heterozygous <i>Card14</i> <sup>E138A/+</sup> mice. Selective inactivation of keratinocyte-specific MALT1 proteolytic activity strongly ameliorated the <i>Card14</i> <sup>E138A/+</sup>- and <i>Card14</i> <sup>ΔQ136/+</sup>-induced skin disease, which was reproduced by using the imiquimod-induced mouse model. Together, our results suggest a sequence of events under CARD14-mutation-induced psoriasis condition that keratinocyte-intrinsic activation of CBM complex initiates the skin inflammation depending on the IL-23/T17 axis. Targeting keratinocytes by inactivation of MALT1 paracaspase activity might be a promising therapeutic target for early psoriasis treatment.	2021	07	19	J Immunol	Zhang	Shanshan
33640899	10.1038/s41392-021-00477-8	TRIM41 is required to innate antiviral response by polyubiquitinating BCL10 and recruiting NEMO.	Sensing of pathogenic nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) not only initiates anti-microbe defense but causes inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) critical in innate response need to be further identified. Here we report that the tripartite motif-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM41 is required to innate antiviral response through facilitating pathogenic nucleic acids-triggered signaling pathway. TRIM41 deficiency impairs the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons in macrophages after transfection with nucleic acid-mimics and infection with both DNA and RNA viruses. In vivo, TRIM41 deficiency leads to impaired innate response against viruses. Mechanistically, TRIM41 directly interacts with BCL10 (B cell lymphoma 10), a core component of CARD proteins-BCL10 - MALT1 (CBM) complex, and modifies the Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation of BCL10, which, in turn, hubs NEMO for activation of NF-κB and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) - interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathways. Our study suggests that TRIM41 is the potential universal E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for Lys63 linkage of BCL10 during innate antiviral response, adding new insight into the molecular mechanism for the control of innate antiviral response.	2022	03	04	Signal Transduct Target Ther	Yu	Zhou

However, the impact of CARD11 deficiency on human B-cell development, signaling, and function is incompletely understood. This study sought to determine the cellular, immunological, and biochemical basis of disease for 2 unrelated patients who presented with profound CID associated with viral and fungal respiratory infections, interstitial lung disease, and severe colitis. Patients underwent next-generation sequencing, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, signaling assays by immunoblot, and transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing. Both patients carried identical novel pathogenic biallelic loss-of-function variants in CARD11 (c.2509C&gt;T; p.Arg837∗) leading to undetectable protein expression. This variant prevented CBM complex formation, severely impairing the activation of nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and MALT1 paracaspase activity in B and T cells. This functional defect resulted in a developmental block in B cells at the naive and type 1 transitional B-cell stage and impaired circulating T follicular helper cell (cT<sub>FH</sub>) development, which was associated with impaired antibody responses and absent germinal center structures on lymph node histology. Transcriptomics indicated that CARD11-dependent signaling is essential for immune signaling pathways involved in the development of these cells. Both patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, which led to functional normalization. Complete human CARD11 deficiency causes profound CID by impairing naive/type 1 B-cell and cT<sub>FH</sub> cell development and abolishing activation of MALT1 paracaspase, NF-κB, and JNK activity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation functionally restores impaired signaling pathways.	2021	12	21	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Lu	Henry Y
33941870	10.1038/s41418-021-00787-y	USP12 promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses through deubiquitinating and stabilizing BCL10.	Deubiquitinases (DUBs) regulate diverse biological processes and represent a novel class of drug targets. However, the biological function of only a small fraction of DUBs, especially in adaptive immune response regulation, is well-defined. In this study, we identified DUB ubiquitin-specific peptidase 12 (USP12) as a critical regulator of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. USP12 plays an intrinsic role in promoting the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotype, including differentiation, activation, and proliferation. Although USP12-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells protected mice from autoimmune diseases, the immune response against bacterial infection was subdued. USP12 stabilized B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) by deubiquitinating, and thereby activated the NF-κB signaling pathway. Interestingly, this USP12 regulatory mechanism was identified in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our study results showed that USP12 activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell signaling, and targeting USP12 might help develop therapeutic interventions for treating inflammatory diseases or pathogen infections.	2022	03	25	Cell Death Differ	Fu	Yuling
34014917	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007986	Signaling through polymerization and degradation: Analysis and simulations of T cell activation mediated by Bcl10.	The adaptive immune system serves as a potent and highly specific defense mechanism against pathogen infection. One component of this system, the effector T cell, facilitates pathogen clearance upon detection of specific antigens by the T cell receptor (TCR). A critical process in effector T cell activation is transmission of signals from the TCR to a key transcriptional regulator, NF-κB. The transmission of this signal involves a highly dynamic process in which helical filaments of Bcl10, a key protein constituent of the TCR signaling cascade, undergo competing processes of polymeric assembly and macroautophagy-dependent degradation. Through computational analysis of three-dimensional, super-resolution optical micrographs, we quantitatively characterize TCR-stimulated Bcl10 filament assembly and length dynamics, and demonstrate that filaments become shorter over time. Additionally, we develop an image-based, bootstrap-like resampling method that demonstrates the preferred association between autophagosomes and both Bcl10-filament ends and punctate-Bcl10 structures, implying that autophagosome-driven macroautophagy is directly responsible for Bcl10 filament shortening. We probe Bcl10 polymerization-depolymerization dynamics with a stochastic Monte-Carlo simulation of nucleation-limited filament assembly and degradation, and we show that high probabilities of filament nucleation in response to TCR engagement could provide the observed robust, homogeneous, and tunable response dynamic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the speed of filament disassembly preferentially at filament ends provides effective regulatory control. Taken together, these data suggest that Bcl10 filament growth and degradation act as an excitable system that provides a digital response mechanism and the reliable timing critical for T cell activation and regulatory processes.	2021	09	10	PLoS Comput Biol	Campanello	Leonard
34192836	10.1515/hsz-2021-0250	The paracaspase MALT1 in psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a frequent autoimmune-related skin disease, which involves various cell types such as T cells, keratinocytes and dendritic cells. Genetic variations, such as mutations of <i>CARD14</i>, can promote the development of the disease. <i>CARD14</i> mutations as well as the stimulation of immune and cytokine receptors activate the paracaspase MALT1, a potent activator of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. The disease-promoting role of MALT1 for psoriasis is mediated by both its protease activity as well as its molecular scaffold function. Here, we review the importance of MALT1-mediated signaling and its therapeutic implications in psoriasis.	2021	12	30	Biol Chem	Hailfinger	Stephan
34236636	10.1007/978-1-0716-1669-7_8	Methods to Study CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 Dependent Canonical NF-κB Activation in Jurkat T Cells.	Jurkat T cells have been of central importance for the discovery of signalling mediators driving NF-κB activation in response to T cell antigen receptor (TCR)/CD28 co-stimulation. The critical function of the key regulators identified in Jurkat T cells has subsequently been verified in primary murine and human T cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing techniques in combination with viral reconstitution are powerful tools that now enable the investigation of the exact molecular mechanisms that govern T cell signalling, especially the impact of protein-protein interactions, protein modifications, or cancer-associated gain- or loss-of-function mutations. As exemplified by the CARD11 gene encoding a key regulator of NF-κB signalling in T cells, we describe here the detailed workflow for the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) Jurkat T cells and the subsequent reconstitution using a lentiviral transduction protocol. In addition, we explain the use of a stable NF-κB-dependent EGFP reporter system that enables a reliable quantification of NF-κB transcriptional activation in the reconstituted KO Jurkat T cells.	2022	01	12	Methods Mol Biol	Gewies	Andreas
34412631	10.1186/s12935-021-02143-z	Contribution of nuclear BCL10 expression to tumor progression and poor prognosis of advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by activating NF-κB-related signaling.	We previously demonstrated that nuclear BCL10 translocation participates in the instigation of NF-κB in breast cancer and lymphoma cell lines. In this study, we assessed whether nuclear BCL10 translocation is clinically significant in advanced and metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We analyzed the expression of BCL10-, cell cycle-, and NF-κB- related signaling molecules, and the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in three PDAC cell lines (mutant KRAS lines: PANC-1 and AsPC-1; wild-type KRAS line: BxPC-3) using BCL10 short hairpin RNA (shBCL10). To assess the anti-tumor effect of BCL10 knockdown in PDAC xenograft model, PANC-1 cells treated with or without shBCL10 transfection were inoculated into the flanks of mice. We assessed the expression patterns of BCL10 and NF-κB in tumor cells in 136 patients with recurrent, advanced, and metastatic PDAC using immunohistochemical staining. We revealed that shBCL10 transfection caused cytoplasmic translocation of BCL10 from the nuclei, inhibited cell viability, and enhanced the cytotoxicities of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in three PDAC cell lines. Inhibition of BCL10 differentially blocked cell cycle progression in PDAC cell lines. Arrest at G1 phase was noted in wild-type KRAS cell lines; and arrest at G2/M phase was noted in mutant KRAS cell lines. Furthermore, shBCL10 transfection downregulated the expression of phospho-CDC2, phospho-CDC25C, Cyclin B1 (PANC-1), Cyclins A, D1, and E, CDK2, and CDK4 (BxPC-3), p-IκBα, nuclear expression of BCL10, BCL3, and NF-κB (p65), and attenuated the NF-κB pathway activation and its downstream molecule, c-Myc, while inhibition of BCL10 upregulated expression of p21, and p27 in both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. In a PANC-1-xenograft mouse model, inhibition of BCL10 expression also attenuated the tumor growth of PDAC. In clinical samples, nuclear BCL10 expression was closely associated with nuclear NF-κB expression (p &lt; 0.001), and patients with nuclear BCL10 expression had the worse median overall survival than those without nuclear BCL10 expression (6.90 months versus 9.53 months, p = 0.019). Nuclear BCL10 translocation activates NF-κB signaling and contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis of advanced/metastatic PDAC.	2021	08	22	Cancer Cell Int	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
34481211	10.1016/j.prp.2021.153593	Bcl-10, trypsin and synaptophysin helps recognize acinar cell and mixed acinar neuroendocrine cell carcinoma of the pancreas on both preoperative cytological samples and needle biopsy specimens.	Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas are known to be rare and difficult to be recognize because they mimic other unrelated tumors (neuroendocrine, solid pseudopapillary) with different clinical behavior. Especially in the setting of inoperable patients, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), core needle biopsy (FNAB) and immunocyto/histochemistry (ICC/IHC) play a crucial role in the differential diagnosis. The biological material available for ICC tests obtained by minimal invasive procedures is usually limited. Aim of the current study was to evaluate diagnostic panel based on a limited number of ICC markers for typing preoperatively ACC of the pancreas. Of 1820 needle sampling procedures performed and related to pancreatic lesions, 21 cases were extracted with a confirmed diagnosis of ACC on histology. Of them,12 were pure ACC and 9 mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC). Smears of ACC, MANEC and a control group composed of 34neuroendocrine, 7solid pseudopapillary, 50ductal and 4 adenosquamous carcinoma were assessed with an ICC panel made up of BCL10, trypsin, synaptophysin, chromograninA, β-catenin. On cytology, BCL10 sensitivity and specificity for ACC was 100%. Trypsin correctly recognized 90% of the cases. Synaptophysin was helpful to correctly identify all the cases with a mixed neuroendocrine component. No significant cross-reaction was observed between BCL10 and trypsin in any of the control group case. BCL10 is a determinant marker for the diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma and mixed acinar neuroendocrine cell carcinoma of the pancreas in a pre-operative citologic/histologic setting.	2022	01	28	Pathol Res Pract	Manfrin	Erminia

34826258	10.1126/sciimmunol.abi4425	Keratinocyte-intrinsic BCL10/MALT1 activity initiates and amplifies psoriasiform skin inflammation.	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease arising from poorly defined pathological cross-talk between keratinocytes and the immune system. BCL10 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10) and MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) are ubiquitously expressed inflammatory signaling proteins that can interact with the psoriasis susceptibility factor CARD14, but their functions in psoriasis are insufficiently understood. We report that although keratinocyte-intrinsic BCL10/MALT1 deletions completely rescue inflammatory skin pathology triggered by germline <i>Card14</i> gain-of-function mutation in mice, the BCL10/MALT1 signalosome is unexpectedly not involved in the CARD14-dependent interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) proximal pathway. Instead, it plays a more pleiotropic role by amplifying keratinocyte responses to a series of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-1β, and TNF. Moreover, selective keratinocyte-intrinsic activation of BCL10/MALT1 signaling with an artificial engager molecule is sufficient to initiate lymphocyte-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation, and aberrant BCL10/MALT1 activity is frequently detected in the skin of human sporadic psoriasis. Together, these results establish that BCL10/MALT1 signalosomes can act as initiators and crucial amplifiers of psoriatic skin inflammation and indicate a critical function for this complex in sporadic psoriasis.	2022	03	07	Sci Immunol	Kurgyis	Zsuzsanna
34868072	10.3389/fimmu.2021.786572	Clinical and Immunological Features of Human BCL10 Deficiency.	The CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex is critical for the proper assembly of human immune responses. The clinical and immunological consequences of deficiencies in some of its components such as CARD9, CARD11, and MALT1 have been elucidated in detail. However, the scarcity of BCL10 deficient patients has prevented gaining detailed knowledge about this genetic disease. Only two patients with BCL10 deficiency have been reported to date. Here we provide an in-depth description of an additional patient with autosomal recessive complete BCL10 deficiency caused by a nonsense mutation that leads to a loss of expression (K63X). Using mass cytometry coupled with unsupervised clustering and machine learning computational methods, we obtained a thorough characterization of the consequences of BCL10 deficiency in different populations of leukocytes. We showed that in addition to the near absence of memory B and T cells previously reported, this patient displays a reduction in NK, γδT, Tregs, and T<sub>FH</sub> cells. The patient had recurrent respiratory infections since early childhood, and showed a family history of lethal severe infectious diseases. Fortunately, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) cured her. Overall, this report highlights the importance of early genetic diagnosis for the management of BCL10 deficient patients and HSCT as the recommended treatment to cure this disease.	2022	02	14	Front Immunol	Garcia-Solis	Blanca
34879060	10.1371/journal.pntd.0010029	Deep resequencing identifies candidate functional genes in leprosy GWAS loci.	Leprosy is the second most prevalent mycobacterial disease globally. Despite the existence of an effective therapy, leprosy incidence has consistently remained above 200,000 cases per year since 2010. Numerous host genetic factors have been identified for leprosy that contribute to the persistently high case numbers. In the past decade, genetic epidemiology approaches, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identified more than 30 loci contributing to leprosy susceptibility. However, GWAS loci commonly encompass multiple genes, which poses a challenge to define causal candidates for each locus. To address this problem, we hypothesized that genes contributing to leprosy susceptibility differ in their frequencies of rare protein-altering variants between cases and controls. Using deep resequencing we assessed protein-coding variants for 34 genes located in GWAS or linkage loci in 555 Vietnamese leprosy cases and 500 healthy controls. We observed 234 nonsynonymous mutations in the targeted genes. A significant depletion of protein-altering variants was detected for the IL18R1 and BCL10 genes in leprosy cases. The IL18R1 gene is clustered with IL18RAP and IL1RL1 in the leprosy GWAS locus on chromosome 2q12.1. Moreover, in a recent GWAS we identified an HLA-independent signal of association with leprosy on chromosome 6p21. Here, we report amino acid changes in the CDSN and PSORS1C2 genes depleted in leprosy cases, indicating them as candidate genes in the chromosome 6p21 locus. Our results show that deep resequencing can identify leprosy candidate susceptibility genes that had been missed by classic linkage and association approaches.	2022	02	16	PLoS Negl Trop Dis	Fava	Vinicius M
34928543	10.1002/iub.2581	BCL10 correlates with bad prognosis and immune infiltration of tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.	It has been reported that B-cell CLL-lymphoma 10 (BCL10) serves as an oncogene in cervical cancer. However, the roles of BCL10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially involved in immune infiltration remain not clear. This study aims to explore the relationship between BCL10 and the prognosis and clinical significance, and immune infiltration in HCC. The expression of BCL10 was analyzed between HCC samples and non-tumor samples in the multiple datasets. In addition, the prognostic values of BCL10 and its methylation in HCC were also investigated. The clinical significance of BCL10 has also been explored. Furthermore, the correlation between BCL10 and immune infiltration in HCC microenvironment was assessed. Finally, the biological behaviors of BCL10 in HCC were verified by cell function experiments. It was found that the expression levels of BCL10 were increased in HCC patients in multiple datasets. Moreover, the increased BCL10 and its reduced methylation were associated with the poor survival. BCL10 was significantly associated with immune infiltration. When BCL10 was knocked down in HCC cells, their proliferation ability was significantly inhibited, their migration was significantly decreased, their apoptosis was significantly increased, and AKT signaling pathway was inhibited. In conclusion, BCL10 is a potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarker related to immune infiltration in HCC microenvironment.	2022	01	08	IUBMB Life	Chen	Hao
31241148	10.1093/cvr/cvz169	B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 10 and angiotensin II-induced kidney injury.	B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 10 (Bcl10) is a member of the CARMA-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome, linking angiotensin (Ang) II, and antigen-dependent immune-cell activation to nuclear factor kappa-B signalling. We showed earlier that Bcl10 plays a role in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodelling, independent of blood pressure. We now investigated the role of Bcl10 in Ang II-induced renal damage. Bcl10 knockout mice (Bcl10 KO) and wild-type (WT) controls were given 1% NaCl in the drinking water and Ang II (1.44 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Additionally, Bcl10 KO or WT kidneys were transplanted onto WT mice that were challenged by the same protocol for 7 days. Kidneys of Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice developed less fibrosis and showed fewer infiltrating cells. Nevertheless, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal) and kidney injury molecule (Kim)1 expression was higher in the kidneys of Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice, indicating exacerbated tubular damage. Furthermore, albuminuria was significantly higher in Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice accompanied by reduced glomerular nephrin expression and podocyte number. Ang II-treated WT mice transplanted with Bcl10 KO kidney showed more albuminuria and renal Ngal, compared to WT- &gt; WT kidney-transplanted mice, as well as lower podocyte number but similar fibrosis and cell infiltration. Interestingly, mice lacking Bcl10 in the kidney exhibited less Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy than controls. Bcl10 has multi-faceted actions in Ang II-induced renal damage. On the one hand, global Bcl10 deficiency ameliorates renal fibrosis and cell infiltration; on the other hand, lack of renal Bcl10 aggravates albuminuria and podocyte damage. These data suggest that Bcl10 maintains podocyte integrity and renal function.	2020	10	19	Cardiovasc Res	Markó	Lajos
31751629	10.1016/j.dci.2019.103555	The signaling relations between three adaptors of porcine C-type lectin receptor pathway.	As one family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), The C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) play a key role in the anti-fungal infection. The CLR pathway signaling is relayed by adaptor complex which comprises CARD9, BCL10 and MALT1. However, the relationship between these three adaptors has not been investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine CARD9, BCL10 and MALT1 and examined their signaling functions. The three ectopic adaptors were similarly and uniformly expressed in cytoplasm, with CARD9 inactive, BCL10 significant active, and MALT1 slightly active for downstream NF-κB signaling and gene expressions. With the three adaptors together, NF-κB signaling and gene expressions were strongly activated, however, no IFN signal was activated in any case. The signaling relationship between the adaptors were dissected, the NF-κB signaling results showed that CARD9 could inhibit both BCL10 and MALT1 activities, while BCL10 and MALT1 synergized each other particularly when moderate amount of BCL10 plus low amount of MALT1 were considered. Low amount of CARD9 could further synergized with BCL10 and MALT1, maximizing signaling activity of the adaptor complex. This study revealed the porcine CLR pathway adaptor signaling functions and their optimal collective activity, thus providing a unique insight into the porcine innate immunity.	2021	06	23	Dev Comp Immunol	Jiang	Sen
31757436	10.1016/j.pathol.2019.08.012	Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma: lessons from Western and Eastern diagnostic approaches.	Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZLs) are a group of clinically indolent B-cell lymphomas postulated to derive from memory B lymphocytes in the 'marginal zone' of secondary lymphoid tissue. Today, MZL is recognised as a nosological umbrella term encompassing distinct entities with some shared phenotypic and genotypic features, including extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (EMZL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, splenic MZL, and nodal MZL, accounting for approximately 70%, 20%, and 10% of MZLs, respectively. These lymphomas share some phenotypic and genotypic features and have some variants and related provisional diseases, but are different in regards to their clinical and molecular characteristics. In addition, they are frequently associated with chronic antigenic stimulation represented either by infectious agents, particularly bacteria and viruses, or autoimmune diseases as exemplified by Sjögren syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and newly recognised IgG4-related disease. Furthermore, several chromosomal translocations have been identified in EMZL. In this review, we will focus on the updated histopathological criteria and the main problems with differential diagnoses in order to aid the diagnostic approach in our routine practice.	2020	07	29	Pathology	Nakamura	Shigeo
31774199	10.15252/embj.2019102030	Paracaspase MALT1 regulates glioma cell survival by controlling endo-lysosome homeostasis.	Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer with a median survival of around 15 months. A potential treatment strategy involves targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC), which constitute a cell autonomous reservoir of aberrant cells able to initiate, maintain, and repopulate the tumor mass. Here, we report that the expression of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue l (MALT1), a protease previously linked to antigen receptor-mediated NF-κB activation and B-cell lymphoma survival, inversely correlates with patient probability of survival. The knockdown of MALT1 largely impaired the expansion of patient-derived stem-like cells in vitro, and this could be recapitulated with pharmacological inhibitors, in vitro and in vivo. Blocking MALT1 protease activity increases the endo-lysosome abundance, impairs autophagic flux, and culminates in lysosomal-mediated cell death, concomitantly with mTOR inactivation and dispersion from endo-lysosomes. These findings place MALT1 as a new druggable target involved in glioblastoma and unveil ways to modulate the homeostasis of endo-lysosomes.	2020	07	13	EMBO J	Jacobs	Kathryn A

31883669	10.1016/j.pathol.2019.09.014	The clinicopathological and genetic features of ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Ovarian lymphoma, whether a primary or secondary condition, is very rare. Little is known about its genetic aberrations. Here, we reviewed the clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of nine ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases and performed fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis to detect MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 translocations. We also performed whole exome sequencing analysis to determine their genomic features compared with those of conventional extranodal DLBCL. The results showed that six of nine cases were bilateral and three cases were left-sided. Histologically, the tumour cells were homogeneous and a starry-sky pattern was very common in ovarian DLBCL (Burkitt-like). Immunohistochemically, most of the cases (7/9) were germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) subtype, and dual expression of MYC and BCL2 was found in three cases of ovarian DLBCL. A double-hit (involving MYC and BCL6) phenotype was found in one case of ovarian DLBCL (GCB subtype). Sequencing analysis revealed that NOTCH4, NCOR2, BCL10 and CARD11 were frequently mutated both in ovarian DLBCL and conventional extranodal DLBCL. COL27A1, PRKCB, HLA-A, NOTCH3 and HDAC4 mutations were found only in ovarian DLBCL but not in conventional DLBCL, and NOTCH3 and HDAC4 mutations were only identified in the GCB subtype. Furthermore, several signalling pathways including the B-cell receptor, Epstein-Barr virus infection, HTLV-1 infection, Notch, PI3K-AKT and mTOR were found to be involved in ovarian DLBCL. Our results broaden the understanding of the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of ovarian DLBCL and compare their genetic features to those of conventional extranodal DLBCL for the first time.	2020	11	16	Pathology	Xu	Hui
31961340	10.1172/JCI97040	GRK2 suppresses lymphomagenesis by inhibiting the MALT1 proto-oncoprotein.	Antigen receptor-dependent (AgR-dependent) stimulation of the NF-κB transcription factor in lymphocytes is a required event during adaptive immune response, but dysregulated activation of this signaling pathway can lead to lymphoma. AgR stimulation promotes assembly of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex, wherein MALT1 acts as (a) a scaffold to recruit components of the canonical NF-κB machinery and (b) a protease to cleave and inactivate specific substrates, including negative regulators of NF-κB. In multiple lymphoma subtypes, malignant B cells hijack AgR signaling pathways to promote their own growth and survival, and inhibiting MALT1 reduces the viability and growth of these tumors. As such, MALT1 has emerged as a potential pharmaceutical target. Here, we identified G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a new MALT1-interacting protein. We demonstrated that GRK2 binds the death domain of MALT1 and inhibits MALT1 scaffolding and proteolytic activities. We found that lower GRK2 levels in activated B cell-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) are associated with reduced survival, and that GRK2 knockdown enhances ABC-DLBCL tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings suggest that GRK2 can function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting MALT1 and provide a roadmap for developing new strategies to inhibit MALT1-dependent lymphomagenesis.	2020	09	15	J Clin Invest	Cheng	Jing
32008135	10.1007/s10875-020-00760-3	Human BCL10 Deficiency due to Homozygosity for a Rare Allele.	In 2014, a child with broad combined immunodeficiency (CID) who was homozygous for a private BCL10 allele was reported to have complete inherited human BCL10 deficiency. In the present study, we report a new BCL10 mutation in another child with CID who was homozygous for a BCL10 variant (R88X), previously reported as a rare allele in heterozygosis (minor allele frequency, 0.000003986). The mutant allele was a loss-of-expression and loss-of-function allele. As with the previously reported patient, this patient had complete BCL10 deficiency. The clinical phenotype shared features, such as respiratory infections, but differed from that of the previous patient that he did not develop significant gastroenteritis episodes or chronic colitis. Cellular and immunological phenotypes were similar to those of the previous patient. TLR4, TLR2/6, and Dectin-1 responses were found to depend on BCL10 in fibroblasts, and final maturation of T cell and B cell maturation into memory cells was affected. Autosomal-recessive BCL10 deficiency should therefore be considered in children with CID.	2021	07	02	J Clin Immunol	Van Den Rym	Ana
32012328	10.1002/hon.2718	High throughput sequencing reveals high specificity of TNFAIP3 mutations in ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas.	The majority of ocular adnexal (OA) lymphomas (OAL) are extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (MZL). First high throughput sequencing (HTS) studies on OA-MZL showed inconsistent results and the distribution of mutations in reactive lymphoid lesions of this anatomic region has not yet been sufficiently addressed. We characterized OAL and lymphoid lesions of the OA by targeted HTS. The study included 34 OA-MZL, 11 chronic conjunctivitis, five mature small cell B-cell lymphomas spreading to the OA, five diseases with increase of IgG4+ plasma cells, three Burkitt lymphomas (BL), three diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), three mantle cell lymphomas, three idiopathic orbital inflammations/orbital pseudo tumors (PT), and three OA lymphoid hyperplasia. All cases were negative for Chlamydia. The mutational number was highest in BL and lowest in PT. The most commonly (and exclusively) mutated gene in OA-MZL was TNFAIP3 (10 of 34 cases). Altogether, 20 out of 34 patients harbored mutually exclusive mutations of either TNFAIP3, BCL10, MYD88, ATM, BRAF, or NFKBIE, or nonexclusive mutations of IRF8, TNFRSF14, KLHL6, and TBL1XR1, all encoding for NK-κB pathway compounds or regulators. Thirteen patients (38%) had, to a great part, mutually exclusive mutations of chromatin modifier-encoding genes: KMT2D, CREBBP, BCL7A, DNMT3A, EP300, or HIST1H1E. Only four patients harbored co-occurring mutations of genes encoding for NK-κB compounds and chromatin modifiers. Finally, PTEN, KMT2D, PRDM1, and HIST1H2BK mutations were observable in reactive lymphoid lesions too, while such instances were devoid of NF-κB compound mutations and/or mutations of acetyltransferase-encoding genes. In conclusion, 80% of OA-MZL display mutations of either NK-κB compounds or chromatin modifiers. Lymphoid lesions of the OA bearing NF-κB compound mutations and/or mutations of acetyltransferase-encoding genes highly likely represent lymphomas.	2020	08	31	Hematol Oncol	Vela	Visar

Caspase recruitment domain containing protein 9 (CARD9) has been demonstrated to be a pro-tumor factor in various cancers. However, our previous study found a significant decrease of CARD9 in malignant pleural effusion compared with benign pleural effusion. So we investigated the role of CARD9 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its working mechanism. Immunohistochemistry, western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of CARD9 in specimens of NSCLC patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databasewas also used to analyze the expression of CARD9 in NSCLC and its predicting value for prognosis. Immunofluorescence was used for CARD9 cellular location. Cell growth assay, clonal formation assay, wound healing assay, matrigel invasion assay, and flow cytometry were used to test cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and cycle progression of NSCLC cells with CARD9 knockdown or CARD9 overexpression. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to identify the interaction between CARD9 and B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10). SB203580 was used to inhibit p38 activation. CARD9 was decreased in NSCLC tissues compared with normal tissues; low CARD9 expression was associated with poor survival. CARD9 was expressed both in tumor cells and macrophages. Downregulation of CARD9 in NSCLC cells enhanced the abilities of proliferation, invasion and migration via activated MAPK/p38 signaling, while overexpression of CARD9 presented antitumor effects. BCL10 was identified to interact with CARD9. We demonstrate that CARD9 is an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC patients and inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion by suppressing MAPK/p38 pathway in NSCLC cells.	2021	03	10	Cancer Res Treat	Pan	Linyue
32179489	10.1016/j.cancergen.2020.02.005	Integrating transcriptome-wide association study and copy number variation study identifies candidate genes and pathways for diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	The genetic basis of diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DNHL) is largely unknown now. We conducted a large-scale transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of DNHL to identify novel candidates for DNHL. The GWAS summary data of DNHL was obtained from the UKBiobank, involving 685 cases and 451,579 controls. TWAS of DNHL was performed using tissue-specific gene expression weights generated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data. The DNHLTWAS results were further validated by a previous published copy number alterations (CNA) study of DNHL. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of identified candidate genes were conducted by the DAVID 6.8. We identified 214 genes with TWAS P value &lt; 0.05 for DNHL, such as MRPL19 (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0010), CRCP (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0010) and SEMA3C (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0010). After further comparing the 214 genes with copy number variations of DNHL patients, we found 1 overlapped gene, BCL10 (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0100). We also detected 6 common GO terms shared between gene set enrichment analysis results of TWAS and CNAs, such as cytosol (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0003, PCNAs = 4.99 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and membrane (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0048, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 0.0046). The pathway enrichment analysis of TWAS and CNAs detected 3 common pathways, including HIF-1 signaling pathway (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0195, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 1.96 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), mTOR signaling pathway (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0242, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 6.75 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and adipocytokine signaling pathway (P<sub>TWAS</sub> = 0.0392, P<sub>CNAs</sub> = 0.0103). Our study identified multiple DNHL associated genes and pathways, providing novel useful information for the pathogenetic studies of DNHL.	2020	09	21	Cancer Genet	Wu	Di
32343482	10.15252/embr.201949237	MALT1 targeting suppresses CARD14-induced psoriatic dermatitis in mice.	CARD14 gain-of-function mutations cause psoriasis in humans and mice. Together with BCL10 and the protease MALT1, mutant CARD14 forms a signaling node that mediates increased NF-κB signaling and proinflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes. However, it remains unclear whether psoriasis in response to CARD14 hyperactivation is keratinocyte-intrinsic or requires CARD14 signaling in other cells. Moreover, the in vivo effect of MALT1 targeting on mutant CARD14-induced psoriasis has not yet been documented. Here, we show that inducible keratinocyte-specific expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in mice rapidly induces epidermal thickening and inflammation as well as increased expression of several genes associated with psoriasis in humans. Keratinocyte-specific MALT1 deletion as well as oral treatment of mice with a specific MALT1 protease inhibitor strongly reduces psoriatic skin disease in CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> mice. Together, these data illustrate a keratinocyte-intrinsic causal role of enhanced CARD14/MALT1 signaling in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and show the potential of MALT1 inhibition for the treatment of psoriasis.	2021	04	27	EMBO Rep	Van Nuffel	Elien
32388054	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104115	TAK1 lessens the activity of the paracaspase MALT1 during T cell receptor signaling.	The CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex couples antigen receptors to the activation of Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors in T/B lymphocytes. Within this signalosome, the MALT1 paracaspase serves dual roles: it is a crucial adaptor for signal transduction to NF-κB signaling, and a protease that shapes NF-κB activity and lymphocyte activation. Although a subtle choreography of ubiquitination and phosphorylation orchestrate the CBM, how precisely this complex and MALT1 enzyme are regulated continue to be elucidated. Here, we report that the chemical inhibition or the siRNA-based silencing of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a known partner of the CBM complex required for NF-κB activation, enhanced the processing of MALT1 substrates. We further show that the assembly of the CBM as well as the ubiquitination of MALT1 was augmented when TAK1 was inhibited. Thus, TAK1 may initiate a negative feedback loop to finely tune the CBM complex activity.	2021	01	04	Cell Immunol	Nicolau	Carolina Alves
32450431	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104133	The LUBAC participates in lysophosphatidic acid-induced NF-κB activation.	The natural bioactive glycerophospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) binds to its cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface to promote the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-κB. LPA-mediated activation of NF-κB relies on the formation of a signalosome that contains the scaffold CARMA3, the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (CBM complex). The CBM complex has been extensively studied in lymphocytes, where it links antigen receptors to NF-κB activation via the recruitment of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), a tripartite complex of HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN. Moreover, MALT1 cleaves the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 to further enhance NF-κB activation. However, the contribution of the LUBAC downstream of GPCRs has not been investigated. By using murine embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient for HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN, we report that the LUBAC is crucial for the activation of NF-κB in response to LPA. Further echoing the situation in lymphocytes, LPA unbridles the protease activity of MALT1, which cleaves HOIL1 at the Arginine 165. The expression of a MALT1-insensitive version of HOIL1 reveals that this processing is involved in the optimal production of the NF-κB target cytokine interleukin-6. Lastly, we provide evidence that the guanine exchange factor GEF-H1 favors MALT1-mediated cleavage of HOIL1 and NF-κB signaling in this context. Together, our results unveil a critical role for the LUBAC as a positive regulator of NF-κB signaling downstream of LPA receptors.	2021	01	04	Cell Immunol	Douanne	Tiphaine
32574386	10.1111/ejh.13467	MALT-1 as a novel therapeutic target for adult T-cell leukemia.	T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling-induced activation of NF-κB requires assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT-1 complex and IκB kinase (IKK). Gain-of-function alterations in this component of the TCR/NF-κB pathway are associated with the development of HTLV-1-driven adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We aimed to determine whether inhibition of MALT-1-mediated NF-κB activation could have anti-ATL activity. RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to assess expression levels of MALT-1 and the intracellular signaling cascades. Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptotic events were examined using WST-8 assays, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33342 staining. MALT-1 expression was upregulated in ATL-derived T-cell lines compared to that in normal PBMCs and uninfected or HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines. Targeting MALT-1 with siRNA decreased cell proliferation. A MALT-1 inhibitor (MI-2) suppressed cleavage of the MALT-1-target protein, CYLD, and inhibited proliferation via G1 phase arrest. MI-2 induced apoptosis through caspase-3/8/9 activation and inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα, resulting in the accumulation of IκBα and suppression of NF-κB-DNA binding. Additionally, MI-2 inhibited the expression of apoptosis- and cell cycle-related proteins regulated by NF-κB. MALT-1 plays an important regulatory role in NF-κB signaling during ATL-genesis, and targeting MALT-1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease.	2021	07	29	Eur J Haematol	Ishikawa	Chie
32593012	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104147	Regulation and dysregulation of CARD14 signalling and its physiological consequences in inflammatory skin disease.	CARD14 is a scaffold molecule predominantly expressed in keratinocytes and genetic variants in the CARD14 gene confer an increased risk of inflammatory skin disease. Due to its association with common skin diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the biological function of CARD14 is of relevant interest to human health. CARD14 recruits BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 complex, which modulates NF-κB and MAPK signalling pathways, yet little is known about how CARD14 is regulated or activated in the context of the innate immune response and in chronic inflammation. This review summarises the current understanding of the molecular function and regulatory mechanisms of CARD14 and highlights recent findings in human disease and murine mouse models.	2020	11	20	Cell Immunol	Mellett	Mark
32683230	10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126615	Zinc homeostasis plays an important role in the prevention of obesity-induced cardiac inflammation, remodeling and dysfunction.	Obesity often leads to cardiovascular diseases, such as obesity-related cardiac hypertrophy (ORCH), due to chronic cardiac inflammation. Zinc is structurally and functionally essential for many transcription factors, therefore it not only has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress functions, but also has insulin-like function, however, its role in the development of obesity-associated cardiac pathogenesis and the potentially underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the role of zinc homeostasis in the prevention of ORCH. It was recently reported that when four-week old mice were fed either high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet containing deficient, adequate or supplemented zinc, HFD induced obesity and ORCH along with increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and increased expression of B-cell lymphoma/ leukemia 10 (BCL10) and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9). These effects were further aggravated by zinc deficiency and significantly alleviated by zinc supplementation. Mechanistically administration of a p38 MAPK specific inhibitor in HFD-fed mice for 3 months did not affect HFD-induced obesity and increased expression of BCL10 and CARD9, but completely abolished HFD/obesity-induced cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, inhibition of BCL10 expression by siRNA prevented palmitate-induced increased p38 MAPK activation and atrial natriuretic peptide expression. Deletion of metallothionein abolished the protective effect of zinc on palmitate-induced up-regulation of BCL10 and phospho-p38 MAPK. Taken together with other recent studies, we concluded that HFD and zinc deficiency synergistically induce ORCH by increasing oxidative stress-mediated activation of BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK signaling. Zinc supplementation ameliorates ORCH through activation of metallothionein to repress oxidative stress-activated BCL10 expression and p38 MAPK activation.	2021	09	27	J Trace Elem Med Biol	Zhang	Haina
32721634	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104158	Critical protein-protein interactions within the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex: Take-home points for the cell biologist.	The CBM complex, which is composed of the proteins CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1, serves multiple pivotal roles as a mediator of T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor-dependent NF-κB induction and lymphocyte activation. CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 are each proto-oncoproteins and dysregulation of CBM signaling, as a result of somatic gain-of-function mutation or chromosomal translocation, is a hallmark of multiple lymphoid malignancies including Activated B-cell Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. Moreover, loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function germline mutations in CBM complex proteins have been associated with a range of immune dysregulation syndromes. A wealth of detailed structural information has become available over the past decade through meticulous interrogation of the interactions between CBM components. Here, we review key findings regarding the biochemical nature of these protein-protein interactions which have ultimately led the field to a sophisticated understanding of how these proteins assemble into high-order filamentous CBM complexes. To date, approaches to therapeutic inhibition of the CBM complex for the treatment of lymphoid malignancy and/or auto-immunity have focused on blocking MALT1 protease function. We also review key studies relating to the structural impact of MALT1 protease inhibitors on key protein-protein interactions.	2021	03	09	Cell Immunol	Cheng	Jing
32768663	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104161	Bcl10 is associated with actin dynamics at the T cell immune synapse.	T cell responses to antigen are initiated by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)<sup>1</sup>, leading to activation of diverse signaling cascades, including an incompletely defined pathway that triggers rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Defects in the control of actin dynamics and organization are associated with several human immunodeficiency diseases, emphasizing the importance of cytoskeletal remodeling in the functioning of the adaptive immune system. Here, we investigate the role of the adaptor protein Bcl10<sup>2</sup> in the control of actin dynamics. Although Bcl10 is primarily known as a component of the pathway connecting the TCR to activation of the NF-κB<sup>3</sup> transcription factor, a few studies have implicated Bcl10 in antigen receptor-dependent control of actin polymerization and F-actin-dependent functional responses. However, the role of Bcl10 in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics remains largely undefined. To investigate the contribution of Bcl10 in the regulation of TCR-dependent cytoskeletal dynamics, we monitored actin dynamics at the immune synapse of primary murine CD8 effector T cells. Quantification of these dynamics reveals two distinct temporal phases distinguished by differences in speed and directionality. Our results indicate that effector CD8 T cells lacking Bcl10 display faster actin flows and more dynamic lamellipodia, compared to wild-type cells. These studies define a role for Bcl10 in TCR-dependent actin dynamics, emphasizing that Bcl10 has important cytoskeleton-directed functions that are likely independent of its role in transmission of NF-κB -activating signals.	2021	03	09	Cell Immunol	Wagh	Kaustubh

33052237	10.7150/thno.47533	Targeting BCL10 by small peptides for the treatment of B cell lymphoma.	<b>Rationale:</b> Constitutive activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs), the most aggressive and chemoresistant form of DLBCL. In ABC-DLBCLs, the CARMA1-BCL10 (CB) complex forms a filamentous structure and functions as a supramolecular organizing centre (CB-SMOC) that is required for constitutive NF-κB activation, making it an attractive drug target for ABC-DLBCL treatment. However, a pharmaceutical approach targeting CB-SMOC has been lacking. Here, we developed Bcl10 peptide inhibitors (BPIs) that specifically target the BCL10 filamentation process. <b>Methods:</b> Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging were used to visualize the effect of the BPIs on the BCL10 filamentation process. The cytotoxicity of the tested BPIs was evaluated in DLBCL cell lines according to cell proliferation assays. Different <i>in vitro</i> experiments (pharmacokinetics, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, annexin V and PI staining) were conducted to determine the functional mechanisms of the BPIs. The <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic effect of the BPIs was examined in different xenograft DLBCL mouse models. Finally, Ki67 and TUNEL staining and histopathology analysis were used to evaluate the antineoplastic mechanisms and systemic toxicity of the BPIs. <b>Results:</b> We showed that these BPIs can effectively disrupt the BCL10 filamentation process, destabilize BCL10 and suppress NF-κB signalling in ABC-DLBCL cells. By examining a panel of DLBCL cell lines, we found that these BPIs selectively repressed the growth of CB-SMOC-dependent DLBCL cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, by converting the BPIs to acquire a D-retro inverso (DRI) configuration, we developed DRI-BPIs with significantly improved intracellular stability and unimpaired BPI activity. These DRI-BPIs selectively repressed the growth of CB-SMOC-dependent DLBCL tumors in mouse xenograft models without eliciting discernible adverse effects. <b>Conclusion:</b> We developed novel BPIs to target the BCL10 filamentation process and demonstrated that targeting BCL10 by BPIs is a potentially safe and effective pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of ABC-DLBCL and other CB-SMOC-dependent malignancies.	2021	06	01	Theranostics	Bao	Wei
33202260	10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.10.015	Multiplexed Functional Assessment of Genetic Variants in CARD11.	Genetic testing has increased the number of variants identified in disease genes, but the diagnostic utility is limited by lack of understanding variant function. CARD11 encodes an adaptor protein that expresses dominant-negative and gain-of-function variants associated with distinct immunodeficiencies. Here, we used a ""cloning-free"" saturation genome editing approach in a diploid cell line to simultaneously score 2,542 variants for decreased or increased function in the region of CARD11 associated with immunodeficiency. We also described an exon-skipping mechanism for CARD11 dominant-negative activity. The classification of reported clinical variants was sensitive (94.6%) and specific (88.9%), which rendered the data immediately useful for interpretation of seven coding and splicing variants implicated in immunodeficiency found in our clinic. This approach is generalizable for variant interpretation in many other clinically actionable genes, in any relevant cell type.	2021	01	12	Am J Hum Genet	Meitlis	Iana
33297339	10.3390/nu12123755	Gene Expression Alterations Associated with Oleuropein-Induced Antiproliferative Effects and S-Phase Cell Cycle Arrest in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.	It is known that the Mediterranean diet is effective in reducing the risk of several chronic diseases, including cancer. A critical component of the Mediterranean diet is olive oil, and the relationship between olive oil consumption and the reduced risk of cancer has been established. Oleuropein (OL) is the most prominent polyphenol component of olive fruits and leaves. This compound has been shown to have potent properties in various types of cancers, including breast cancer. In the present study, the molecular mechanism of OL was examined in two racially different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines-African American (AA, MDA-MB-468) and Caucasian American (CA, MDA-MB-231). The data obtained showed that OL effectively inhibits cell growth in both cell lines, concomitant with S-phase cell cycle arrest-mediated apoptosis. The results also showed that OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells were two-fold more sensitive to OL antiproliferative effect than MDA-MB-231 cells were. At lower concentrations, OL modified the expression of many apoptosis-involved genes. OL was more effective in MDA-MB-468, compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, in terms of the number and the fold-change of the altered genes. In MDA-MB-468 cells, OL induced a noticeable transcription activation in fourteen genes, including two members of the caspase family: caspase 1 (<i>CASP1</i>) and caspase 14 (<i>CASP14</i>); two members of the TNF receptor superfamily: Fas-associated via death domain (<i>FADD</i>) and TNF receptor superfamily 21 (<i>TNFRSF21</i>); six other proapoptotic genes: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (<i>GADD45A</i>), cytochrome c somatic (<i>CYCS</i>), BCL-2 interacting protein 2 (<i>BNIP2</i>), BCL-2 interacting protein 3 (<i>BNIP3</i>), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (<i>BID</i>), and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (<i>BCL10</i>); and the CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (<i>CFLAR</i>) gene. Moreover, in MDA-MB-468 cells, OL induced a significant upregulation in two antiapoptotic genes: bifunctional apoptosis regulator (<i>BFAR</i>) and B-Raf proto-oncogene (<i>BRAF</i>) and a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat-containing 3 (<i>BIRC3</i>). On the contrary, in MDA-MB-231 cells, OL showed mixed impacts on gene expression. OL significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of four genes: <i>BIRC3</i>, receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (<i>RIPK2</i>), TNF receptor superfamily 10A (<i>TNFRSF10A</i>), and caspase 4 (<i>CASP4</i>). Additionally, another four genes were repressed, including caspase 6 (<i>CASP6</i>), pyrin domain (PYD), and caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing (<i>PAYCARD</i>), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (<i>BIRC5</i>), and the most downregulated TNF receptor superfamily member 11B (<i>TNFRSF11B</i>, 16.34-fold). In conclusion, the data obtained indicate that the two cell lines were markedly different in the anticancer effect and mechanisms of oleuropein's ability to alter apoptosis-related gene expressions. The results obtained from this study should also guide the potential utilization of oleuropein as an adjunct therapy for TNBC to increase chemotherapy effectiveness and prevent cancer progression.	2021	04	27	Nutrients	Messeha	Samia S
33329596	10.3389/fimmu.2020.601926	Cellular and Mathematical Analyses of LUBAC Involvement in T Cell Receptor-Mediated NF-κB Activation Pathway.	The LUBAC ubiquitin ligase complex, composed of the HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN subunits, stimulates the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathways through its Met1-linked linear ubiquitination activity. Here we performed cellular and mathematical modeling analyses of the LUBAC involvement in the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated NF-κB activation pathway, using the Jurkat human T cell line. LUBAC is indispensable for TCR-induced NF-κB and T cell activation, and transiently associates with and linearly ubiquitinates the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, through the catalytic HOIP subunit. In contrast, the linear ubiquitination of NEMO, a substrate of the TNF-α-induced canonical NF-κB activation pathway, was limited during the TCR pathway. Among deubiquitinases, OTULIN, but not CYLD, plays a major role in downregulating LUBAC-mediated TCR signaling. Mathematical modeling indicated that linear ubiquitination of the CBM complex accelerates the activation of IκB kinase (IKK), as compared with the activity induced by linear ubiquitination of NEMO alone. Moreover, simulations of the sequential linear ubiquitination of the CBM complex suggested that the allosteric regulation of linear (de)ubiquitination of CBM subunits is controlled by the ubiquitin-linkage lengths. These results indicated that, unlike the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation pathway, the TCR-mediated NF-κB activation in T lymphocytes has a characteristic mechanism to induce LUBAC-mediated NF-κB activation.	2021	06	21	Front Immunol	Oikawa	Daisuke
30514565	10.1016/j.cellimm.2018.11.001	Ubiquitination and phosphorylation of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome in T cells.	Antigen receptor-induced signaling plays an important role in inflammation and immunity. Formation of a CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex is a key event in T- and B cell receptor-induced gene expression by regulating NF-κB activation and mRNA stability. Deregulated CARD11, BCL10 or MALT1 expression or CBM signaling have been associated with immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and cancer, indicating that CBM formation and function have to be tightly regulated. Over the past years great progress has been made in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of the CBM complex. In this context, several posttranslational modifications play an indispensable role in regulating CBM function and downstream signal transduction. In this review we summarize how the different CBM components as well as their interplay are regulated by protein ubiquitination and phosphorylation in the context of T cell receptor signaling.	2020	04	08	Cell Immunol	Lork	Marie

30773504	10.5582/bst.2018.01291	By regulating miR-182-5p/BCL10/CYCS, sufentanil reduces the apoptosis of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells caused by ropivacaine.	Sufentanil is a type of opioid analgesic and is usually used to facilitate painless labor in combination with the local anesthetic ropivacaine. One aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of sufentanil and ropivacaine on umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs). A second aim of this study was to determine whether sufentanil attenuated the cytotoxicity of ropivacaine in vitro. UCMSCs were divided into 3 groups: one was treated with ropivacaine at a concentration of 50, 100, 200, or 400 μg/mL, another was treated with sufentanil at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 nmol/L, and a third was treated with a combination of ropivacaine at a concentration of 200 μg/mL and sufentanil at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 nmol/L. Results indicated that cell proliferation decreased in cells treated with ropivacaine while it increased in cells treated with sufentanil. In addition, sufentanil limited the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on UCMSC growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Combined treatment with ropivacaine at a concentration of 200 μg/mL and sufentanil at a concentration of 500 nmol/L decreased the proportion of dead and apoptotic UCMSCs, and fewer cells were arrested in the S phase compared to cells treated with ropivacaine. Sufentanil inhibited the apoptosis induced by ropivacaine by increasing miR-182-5p, which regulated the expression of mRNA of the pro-apoptotic genes B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) and cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS). Sufentanil also increased the expression of mRNA of anti-apoptotic genes. In short, ropivacaine inhibits the cell viability and induces the apoptosis of UCMSCs in vitro while sufentanil attenuates this apoptosis by regulating miR182-5p/BCL10/CYCS.	2019	06	28	Biosci Trends	Li	Lisha
31047877	10.1016/j.cca.2019.04.077	BCL10 in cell survival after DNA damage.	The complex defense mechanism of the DNA damage response (DDR) developed by cells during long-term evolution is an important mechanism for maintaining the stability of the genome. Defects in the DDR pathway can lead to the occurrence of various diseases, including tumor development. Most cancer treatments cause DNA damage and apoptosis. However, cancer cells have the natural ability to repair this damage and inhibit apoptosis, ultimately leading to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, investigating the mechanism of DNA damage may contribute markedly to the future treatment of cancer. The CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex formed by B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) regulates apoptosis by activating NF-κB signaling. BCL10 is involved in the formation of complexes that antagonize apoptosis and contribute to cell survival after DNA damage, with cytoplasmic BCL10 entering the nucleus to promote DNA damage repair, including histone ubiquitination and the recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) repair factors. This article reviews the role of BCL10 in cell survival following DNA damage.	2019	12	11	Clin Chim Acta	Luo	Yichen

Gastric mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) are infrequently encountered in routine practice. Some gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) have a variety of differentiation patterns; however, pancreatic acinar differentiation in gastric NECs is rare. The molecular abnormalities of NECs with pancreatic acinar differentiation are not well understood. A 67-year-old male with a gastric MiNEN with pancreatic acinar differentiation without any symptoms. The tumor consisted of two components, including both glandular and solid histological features. Although the former component was a common type of adenocarcinoma, the latter showed endocrine differentiation and expressed pancreatic acinar enzymes immunohistochemically. A positive signal with the anti-BCL10 antibody, which detects one of the pancreatic acinar enzymes, was also present specifically in the latter component. We also examined TP53 genomic mutations, DNA methylation status, and allelic imbalance (AI), which is an indicator of tumor aggressiveness. Although both components of this tumor showed no genomic mutation and a low methylation epigenotype, the frequency of AI was higher in the acinar-endocrine component than in the adenocarcinomatous component. The finding of AI indicated the progression of the conventional adenocarcinoma to an acinar-endocrine component and identified the aggressive potential of the acinar-endocrine component. We report a rare case of gastric MiNEN with pancreatic acinar differentiation. AI analysis revealed tumor progression and aggressiveness. In addition, the usefulness of the anti-BCL10 antibody for detecting the acinar-endocrine component was suggested.	2019	11	25	Diagn Pathol	Fujita	Yasuko
31092922	10.1038/s41586-019-1215-2	Targeting the CBM complex causes T<sub>reg</sub> cells to prime tumours for immune checkpoint therapy.	Solid tumours are infiltrated by effector T cells with the potential to control or reject them, as well as by regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells that restrict the function of effector T cells and thereby promote tumour growth<sup>1</sup>. The anti-tumour activity of effector T cells can be therapeutically unleashed, and is now being exploited for the treatment of some forms of human cancer. However, weak tumour-associated inflammatory responses and the immune-suppressive function of T<sub>reg</sub> cells remain major hurdles to broader effectiveness of tumour immunotherapy<sup>2</sup>. Here we show that, after disruption of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex, most tumour-infiltrating T<sub>reg</sub> cells produce IFNγ, resulting in stunted tumour growth. Notably, genetic deletion of both or even just one allele of CARMA1 (also known as Card11) in only a fraction of T<sub>reg</sub> cells-which avoided systemic autoimmunity-was sufficient to produce this anti-tumour effect, showing that it is not the mere loss of suppressive function but the gain of effector activity by T<sub>reg</sub> cells that initiates tumour control. The production of IFNγ by T<sub>reg</sub> cells was accompanied by activation of macrophages and upregulation of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex on tumour cells. However, tumour cells also upregulated the expression of PD-L1, which indicates activation of adaptive immune resistance<sup>3</sup>. Consequently, blockade of PD-1 together with CARMA1 deletion caused rejection of tumours that otherwise do not respond to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. This effect was reproduced by pharmacological inhibition of the CBM protein MALT1. Our results demonstrate that partial disruption of the CBM complex and induction of IFNγ secretion in the preferentially self-reactive T<sub>reg</sub> cell pool does not cause systemic autoimmunity but is sufficient to prime the tumour environment for successful immune checkpoint therapy.	2019	09	17	Nature	Di Pilato	Mauro
31138793	10.1038/s41467-019-10203-2	Bcl10-controlled Malt1 paracaspase activity is key for the immune suppressive function of regulatory T cells.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have crucial functions in the inhibition of immune responses. Their development and suppressive functions are controlled by the T cell receptor (TCR), but the TCR signaling mechanisms that mediate these effects remain ill-defined. Here we show that CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling mediates TCR-induced NF-κB activation in Tregs and controls the conversion of resting Tregs to effector Tregs under homeostatic conditions. However, in inflammatory milieus, cytokines can bypass the CBM requirement for this differentiation step. By contrast, CBM signaling, in a MALT1 protease-dependent manner, is essential for mediating the suppressive function of Tregs. In malignant melanoma models, acute genetic blockade of BCL10 signaling selectively in Tregs or pharmacological MALT1 inhibition enhances anti-tumor immune responses. Together, our data uncover a segregation of Treg differentiation and suppressive function at the CBM complex level, and provide a rationale to explore MALT1 inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy.	2019	06	17	Nat Commun	Rosenbaum	Marc
31178130	10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.004	ZNF436 promotes tumor cell proliferation through transcriptional activation of BCL10 in glioma.	Transcriptional factors (TFs) are key regulators in orchestrating gene transcription during cancer development. However, their roles in glioma remain elusive. Here, we analyzed the differential expression of TFs and identified ZNF436 is upregulated in glioblastoma and Lower Grade Glioma patients. High expression of ZNF436 is positively associated with poor overall survival and regulated by CREB1 in glioma cells. Knockdown of ZNF436 significantly abolished glioma cells proliferation in vitro. RNA sequencing revealed that ZNF436 regulates cell cycle and controlling BCL10 expression. Overexpression of BCL10 promoted glioma cells growth and rescued the malignant behavior in ZNF436-knockdown cells. High levels of BCL10 also result in a worse prognosis in glioma patients. Taken together, our findings identify the CREB1/ZNF436/BCL10 axis represents a novel, potential therapeutic target for glioma interventions.	2020	07	06	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Shang	Yinwu
31179345	10.1155/2019/9582714	Distinct Effects of Carrageenan and High-Fat Consumption on the Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance in Nonobese and Obese Models of Type 2 Diabetes.	Exposure to low concentration of the common food additive carrageenan (10 mg/L) for only six days led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the C57BL/6J mouse. Longer exposure produced fasting hyperglycemia but with no increase in weight, in contrast to the HFD. Glucose intolerance was attributable to carrageenan-induced inflammation and to increased expression of GRB10. Both HFD and carrageenan increased p(Ser32)-I<i>κ</i>B<i>α</i> and p(Ser307)-IRS1, and the increases were greater following the combined exposure. The effects of carrageenan were inhibited by the combination of the free radical inhibitor Tempol and BCL10 siRNA, which had no impact on the HFD-mediated increase. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin blocked the HFD-induced increases, without an effect on the carrageenan-mediated effects. HFD had no impact on the expression of GRB10. Both carrageenan and high fat increased hepatic infiltration by F4/80-positive macrophages. Serum galectin-3 and galectin-3 binding to the insulin receptor increased by carrageenan and by HFD. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor declined following either exposure and was further reduced by their combination. Carrageenan reduced the activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB; arylsulfatase B), which was unchanged following HFD. Dietary exposure to both high fat and carrageenan can impair insulin signaling through both similar and distinct mechanisms.	2020	01	13	J Diabetes Res	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
31296852	10.1038/s41467-019-10953-z	Structures of autoinhibited and polymerized forms of CARD9 reveal mechanisms of CARD9 and CARD11 activation.	CARD9 and CARD11 drive immune cell activation by nucleating Bcl10 polymerization, but are held in an autoinhibited state prior to stimulation. Here, we elucidate the structural basis for this autoinhibition by determining the structure of a region of CARD9 that includes an extensive interface between its caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and coiled-coil domain. We demonstrate, for both CARD9 and CARD11, that disruption of this interface leads to hyperactivation in cells and to the formation of Bcl10-templating filaments in vitro, illuminating the mechanism of action of numerous oncogenic mutations of CARD11. These structural insights enable us to characterize two similar, yet distinct, mechanisms by which autoinhibition is relieved in the course of canonical CARD9 or CARD11 activation. We also dissect the molecular determinants of helical template assembly by solving the structure of the CARD9 filament. Taken together, these findings delineate the structural mechanisms of inhibition and activation within this protein family.	2019	10	25	Nat Commun	Holliday	Michael J
31391255	10.1074/jbc.RA119.009551	Coordinated regulation of scaffold opening and enzymatic activity during CARD11 signaling.	The activation of key signaling pathways downstream of antigen receptor engagement is critically required for normal lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. CARD11 is a multidomain signaling scaffold protein required for antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and mTOR. Germline mutations in the <i>CARD11</i> gene result in at least four types of primary immunodeficiency, and somatic <i>CARD11</i> gain-of-function mutations drive constitutive NF-κB activity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and other lymphoid cancers. In response to antigen receptor triggering, CARD11 transitions from a closed, inactive state to an open, active scaffold that recruits multiple signaling partners into a complex to relay downstream signaling. However, how this signal-induced CARD11 conversion occurs remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of Inducible Element 1 (IE1), a short regulatory element in the CARD11 Inhibitory Domain, in the CARD11 signaling cycle. We find that IE1 controls the signal-dependent Opening Step that makes CARD11 accessible to the binding of cofactors, including Bcl10, MALT1, and the HOIP catalytic subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. Surprisingly, we find that IE1 is also required at an independent step for the maximal activation of HOIP and MALT1 enzymatic activity after cofactor recruitment to CARD11. This role of IE1 reveals that there is an Enzymatic Activation Step in the CARD11 signaling cycle that is distinct from the Cofactor Association Step. Our results indicate that CARD11 has evolved to actively coordinate scaffold opening and the induction of enzymatic activity among recruited cofactors during antigen receptor signaling.	2020	05	06	J Biol Chem	Wang	Zhaoquan
31420608	10.1038/s41388-019-0958-4	MALT1 is a critical mediator of PAR1-driven NF-κB activation and metastasis in multiple tumor types.	Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a thrombin-responsive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is implicated in promoting metastasis in multiple tumor types, including both sarcomas and carcinomas, but the molecular mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown. We previously discovered that PAR1 stimulation in endothelial cells leads to activation of NF-κB, mediated by a protein complex comprised of CARMA3, Bcl10, and the MALT1 effector protein (CBM complex). Given the strong association between NF-κB and metastasis, we hypothesized that this CBM complex could play a critical role in the PAR1-driven metastatic progression of specific solid tumors. In support of our hypothesis, we demonstrate that PAR1 stimulation results in NF-κB activation in both osteosarcoma and breast cancer, which is suppressed by siRNA-mediated MALT1 knockdown, suggesting that an intact CBM complex is required for the response in both tumor cell types. We identify several metastasis-associated genes that are upregulated in a MALT1-dependent manner after PAR1 stimulation in cancer cells, including those encoding the matrix remodeling protein, MMP9, and the cytokines, IL-1β and IL-8. Further, exogenous expression of PAR1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells confers highly invasive and metastatic behavior which can be blocked by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated MALT1 knockout. Importantly, we find that PAR1 stimulation induces MALT1 protease activity in both osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells, an activity that is mechanistically linked to NF-κB activation and potentially other responses associated with aggressive phenotype. Several small molecule MALT1 protease inhibitors have recently been described that could therefore represent promising new therapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of PAR1-driven tumor metastasis.	2020	03	11	Oncogene	McAuley	J Randall
31427546		Characterisation of immunogenotypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with variable clinical outcomes. The immunogenotypic features of this heterogeneous disease in Malaysia were not well characterized. In total 141 local series of DLBCL cases from UKM Medical Centre were retrospectively studied. Of these cases, we classified our patients into two subtypes: 32.7% (37/113) GCB and non-GCB 67.3% (76/113) by Hans algorithm and the results showed strong agreement with the results by Choi algorithm (κ = 0.828, P&lt;0.001). Survival analysis indicated significant difference in between GCB and non-GCB subtypes (P=0.01), elevated serum LDH (P=0.016), age more than 60-year-old (P=0.021) and the presence of B symptoms (P=0.04). We observed 12% DLBCL cases were CD5 positive and 81.8% of them died of the disease (P=0.076). Analysis on the dual expression of MYC/BCL2 revealed that there is no significant difference in DE and non-DE groups (P=0.916). FISH study reported there were 9.22% (13/141) rearranged cases observed in our population at which highest frequency of BCL6 gene rearrangement (76.9%), followed by MYC (15.4%) and BCL2 (7.7%); no BCL10 and MALT-1 gene rearrangement found regardless of using TMAs or whole tissue samples. More cases of MYC protein overexpression observed compared to MYC translocation. Relatively lower frequency of GCB tumours and low gene rearrangement rates were observed in Malaysian population. A national study is therefore warranted to know better the immunogenotypic characteristics of DLBCL in Malaysia and their implications on the survival.	2020	01	31	Malays J Pathol	Phang	K C
31554683	10.1128/JVI.01499-19	Host CARD11 Inhibits Newcastle Disease Virus Replication by Suppressing Viral Polymerase Activity in Neurons.	Host factors play multiple essential roles in the replication and pathogenesis of mammalian neurotropic viruses. However, the cellular proteins of the central nervous system (CNS) involved in avian neurotropic virus infection have not been completely elucidated. Here, we employed a gene microarray to identify caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11), a lymphoma-associated scaffold protein presenting brain-specific upregulated expression in a virulent neurotropic Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-infected natural host. Chicken primary neuronal cells infected with NDV appeared slightly syncytial and died quickly. CARD11 overexpression inhibited viral replication and delayed cytopathic effects; conversely, depletion of CARD11 enhanced viral replication and cytopathic effects in chicken primary neuronal cells. The inhibition of viral replication by CARD11 could not be blocked with CARD11-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome and NF-κB signaling inhibitors. CARD11 was found to interact directly with the viral phosphoprotein (P) through its CC1 domain and the X domain of P; this X domain also mediated the interaction between P and the viral large polymerase protein (L). The CARD11 CC1 domain and L competitively bound to P via the X domain that hindered the P-L interaction of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, resulting in a reduction of viral polymerase activity in a minigenome assay and inhibition of viral replication. Animal experiments further revealed that CARD11 contributed to viral replication inhibition and neuropathology in infected chicken brains. Taken together, our findings identify CARD11 as a brain-specific antiviral factor of NDV infection in avian species.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially impacts the poultry industry worldwide and causes viral encephalitis and neurological disorders leading to brain damage, paralysis, and death. The mechanism of interaction between this neurotropic virus and the avian central nervous system (CNS) is largely unknown. Here, we report that host protein CARD11 presented brain-specific upregulated expression that inhibited NDV replication, which was not due to CARD11-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex-triggered activation of its downstream signaling pathways. The inhibitory mechanism of viral replication is through the CARD11 CC1 domain, and the viral large polymerase protein (L) competitively interacts with the X domain of the viral phosphoprotein (P), which hampers the P-L interaction, suppressing the viral polymerase activity and viral replication. An <i>in vivo</i> study indicated that CARD11 alleviated neuropathological lesions and reduced viral replication in chicken brains. These results provide insight into the interaction between NDV infection and the host defense in the CNS and a potential antiviral target for viral neural diseases.	2020	06	04	J Virol	Wang	Wenbin
31644910	10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.040	MALT1 Phosphorylation Controls Activation of T Lymphocytes and Survival of ABC-DLBCL Tumor Cells.	The CARMA1/CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex bridges T and B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) ligation to MALT1 protease activation and canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Using unbiased mass spectrometry, we discover multiple serine phosphorylation sites in the MALT1 C terminus after T cell activation. Phospho-specific antibodies reveal that CBM-associated MALT1 is transiently hyper-phosphorylated upon TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. We identify a dual role for CK1α as a kinase that is essential for CBM signalosome assembly as well as MALT1 phosphorylation. Although MALT1 phosphorylation is largely dispensable for protease activity, it fosters canonical NF-κB signaling in Jurkat and murine CD4 T cells. Moreover, constitutive MALT1 phosphorylation promotes survival of activated B cell-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells addicted to chronic BCR signaling. Thus, MALT1 phosphorylation triggers optimal NF-κB activation in lymphocytes and survival of lymphoma cells.	2020	09	16	Cell Rep	Gehring	Torben
31658764	10.3390/ijms20205022	B-Cell Activating Factor Enhances Hepatocyte-Driven Angiogenesis via B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 10/Nuclear Factor-KappaB Signaling during Liver Regeneration.	B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is found to be associated with the histological severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). BAFF was also found to have a protective role in hepatic steatosis via down regulating the expression of steatogenesis genes and enhancing steatosis in hepatocytes through BAFF-R. However, the roles of BAFF during liver regeneration are not well defined. In this study, C57/B6 mice with 70% partial hepatectomy were used as a liver regeneration model. BAFF expression was determined by enzyme immunoassay, and anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies were administered to confirm the effects of BAFF on liver regeneration. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and florescence staining determined the expression of B-cell CCL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10). The angiogenesis promoting capability was evaluated after the transfection of cells with siRNA targeting BCL10 expression, and the role of NF-κB was assessed. The results revealed that the BAFF and BCL10 levels were upregulated after partial hepatectomy. Treatment with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies caused death in mice that were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy within 72 h. In vitro, recombinant BAFF protein did not enhance hepatocyte proliferation; however, transfection with BCL10 siRNA arrested hepatocytes at the G2/M phase. Interestingly, conditioned medium from BAFF-treated hepatocytes enhanced angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) proteins were upregulated by BAFF through BCL10/NF-κB signaling. In mice that were treated with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies, the microvessel density (MVD) of the remaining liver tissues and liver regeneration were both reduced. Taken together, our study demonstrated that an increased expression of BAFF and activation of BCL10/NF-κB signaling were involved in hepatocyte-driven angiogenesis and survival during liver regeneration.	2020	03	31	Int J Mol Sci	Chou	Chia-Hung
28886618	10.1111/cmi.12788	Bcl10 synergistically links CEACAM3 and TLR-dependent inflammatory signalling.	The neutrophil-specific innate immune receptor CEACAM3 functions as a decoy to capture Gram-negative pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, that exploit CEACAM family members to adhere to the epithelium. Bacterial binding to CEACAM3 results in their efficient engulfment and triggers activation of an nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-dependent inflammatory response by human neutrophils. Herein, we report that CEACAM3 cross-linking is not sufficient for induction of cytokine production and show that the inflammatory response induced by Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is elicited by an integration of signals from CEACAM3 and toll-like receptors. Using neutrophils from a human CEACAM-expressing mouse line (CEABAC), we use a genetic approach to reveal a molecular bifurcation of the CEACAM3-mediated antimicrobial and inflammatory responses. Ex vivo experiments with CEABAC-Rac2<sup>-/-</sup> , CEABAC-Bcl10<sup>-/-</sup> , and CEABAC-Malt1<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils indicate that these effectors are not necessary for gonococcal engulfment, yet all 3 effectors contribute to CEACAM3-mediated cytokine production. Interestingly, although Bcl10 and Malt1 are often inextricably linked, Bcl10 enabled synergy between toll-like receptor 4 and CEACAM3, whereas Malt1 did not. Together, these findings reveal an integration of the specific innate immune receptor CEACAM3 into the network of more conventional pattern recognition receptors, providing a mechanism by which the innate immune system can unleash its response to a relentless pathogen.	2018	08	01	Cell Microbiol	Sintsova	Anna
29259013	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1089	The CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 Signalosome Drives NFκB Activation and Promotes Aggressiveness in Angiotensin II Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.	The angiotensin II receptor AGTR1, which mediates vasoconstrictive and inflammatory signaling in vascular disease, is overexpressed aberrantly in some breast cancers. In this study, we established the significance of an AGTR1-responsive NFκB signaling pathway in this breast cancer subset. We documented that AGTR1 overexpression occurred in the luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer, was mutually exclusive of HER2 expression, and correlated with aggressive features that include increased lymph node metastasis, reduced responsiveness to neoadjuvant therapy, and reduced overall survival. Mechanistically, AGTR1 overexpression directed both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activation of NFκB, mediated by a signaling pathway that requires the triad of CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1 (CBM signalosome). Activation of this pathway drove cancer cell-intrinsic responses that include proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, CBM-dependent activation of NFκB elicited cancer cell-extrinsic effects, impacting endothelial cells of the tumor microenvironment to promote tumor angiogenesis. CBM/NFκB signaling in AGTR1<sup>+</sup> breast cancer therefore conspires to promote aggressive behavior through pleiotropic effects. Overall, our results point to the prognostic and therapeutic value of identifying AGTR1 overexpression in a subset of HER2-negative breast cancers, and they provide a mechanistic rationale to explore the repurposing of drugs that target angiotensin II-dependent NFκB signaling pathways to improve the treatment of this breast cancer subset.<b>Significance:</b> These findings offer a mechanistic rationale to explore the repurposing of drugs that target angiotensin action to improve the treatment of AGTR1-expressing breast cancers. <i>Cancer Res; 78(5); 1225-40. ©2017 AACR</i>.	2019	01	16	Cancer Res	Ekambaram	Prasanna
29358699	10.1038/s41598-018-19822-z	GSK3β modulates NF-κB activation and RelB degradation through site-specific phosphorylation of BCL10.	Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of various cellular functions, such as energy homoeostasis, cell growth and developmental processes. More recently, GSK3β has been identified as a part of a protein complex involved in the regulation of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex (CBM complex) formation, which is a key signalling event upon antigen receptor engagement of B and T cells, required for the activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways. However, conflicting reports have been published regarding the role of GSK3β for the activation of the NF-κB signalling pathways. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of GSK3β on the NF-κB signalling induced upon T cell activation. Blocking GSK3β by either pharmacologic inhibitors (SB216763 and SB415286) or by RNAi caused a reduced proteolysis of the MALT1 targets CYLD1, BCL10 and RelB as well as diminished IκBα degradation, NF-κB DNA binding and NF-κB activity. This negative effect on NF-κB appears to be due to a diminished CBM complex formation caused by a reduced BCL10 phosphorylation. Taken together, we provide here evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism by which GSK3β affects NF-κB signalling in activated T cells.	2018	12	11	Sci Rep	Abd-Ellah	Ali
29382759	10.1073/pnas.1721967115	Assembly mechanism of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6 signalosome.	The CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome is a central mediator of T cell receptor and B cell receptor-induced NF-κB signaling that regulates multiple lymphocyte functions. While caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein 1 (CARMA1) nucleates B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) filament formation through interactions between CARDs, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a paracaspase with structural similarity to caspases, which recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) for K63-linked polyubiquitination. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the BCL10 CARD filament at 4.0-Å resolution. The structure redefines CARD-CARD interactions compared with the previous EM structure determined from a negatively stained sample. Surprisingly, time-lapse confocal imaging shows that BCL10 polymerizes in a unidirectional manner. CARMA1, the BCL10 nucleator, serves as a hub for formation of star-shaped filamentous networks of BCL10 and significantly decreases the lag period of BCL10 polymerization. Cooperative MALT1 interaction with BCL10 filaments observed under EM suggests immediate dimerization of MALT1 in the BCL10 filamentous scaffold. In addition, TRAF6 cooperatively decorates CBM filaments to form higher-order assemblies, likely resulting in all-or-none activation of the downstream pathway. Collectively, these data reveal biophysical mechanisms in the assembly of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6 complex for signal transduction.	2018	07	20	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	David	Liron
29649481	10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.057	Role of IκB kinase β in regulating the remodeling of the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex.	The current work investigates the notion that inducible clustering of signaling mediators of the IKK pathway is important for platelet activation. Thus, while the CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 (CBM) complex is essential for triggering IKK/NF-κB activation upon platelet stimulation, the signals that elicit its formation and downstream effector activation remain elusive. We demonstrate herein that IKKβ is involved in membrane fusion, and serves as a critical protein kinase required for initial formation and the regulation of the CARMA1/MALT1/Bcl10/CBM complex in platelets. We also show that IKKβ regulates these processes via modulation of phosphorylation of Bcl10 and IKKγ polyubiquitination. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IKKβ regulates membrane fusion and the remodeling of the CBM complex formation.	2018	09	19	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Karim	Zubair A

Gastric extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is a distinct entity in that Helicobacter pylori infection plays the most important causative role in the development of the disease. To investigate the genomic alteration in gastric marginal zone lymphoma that was resistant to the H. pylori eradication therapy, we analyzed 19 cases of the gastric marginal zone lymphoma using fluorescence in situ hybridization for MALT1, BCL10 rearrangement, and targeted sequencing using an Illumina platform. Major genetic alterations affected genes involved in nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway activation and included MALT1 rearrangement (39%), and somatic mutations of TRAF3 (21%), TNFAIP3 (16%), and NOTCH1 (16%). In the MALT1 rearrangement-negative group, disruptive somatic mutations of TRAF3 were the most common alterations (4/12, 33%), followed by somatic mutations of TNFAIP3 (3/12, 25%), and NOTCH1 (3/12, 25%). The present study confirms that genes involved in activation of NF-κB-signaling pathways are a major driver in oncogenesis of H. pylori eradication-resistant gastric marginal zone lymphoma and revealed that TRAF3 mutation is a major contributor in MALT1 rearrangement-negative gastric marginal zone lymphoma.	2019	07	17	Mod Pathol	Hyeon	Jiyeon
29881386	10.3389/fimmu.2018.01136	Ancient Origin of the CARD-Coiled Coil/Bcl10/MALT1-Like Paracaspase Signaling Complex Indicates Unknown Critical Functions.	The CARD-coiled coil (CC)/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) signaling complexes composed of a CARD-CC family member (CARD-9, -10, -11, or -14), Bcl10, and the type 1 paracaspase MALT1 (PCASP1) play a pivotal role in immunity, inflammation, and cancer. Targeting MALT1 proteolytic activity is of potential therapeutic interest. However, little is known about the evolutionary origin and the original functions of the CBM complex. Type 1 paracaspases originated before the last common ancestor of planulozoa (bilaterians and cnidarians). Notably in bilaterians, Ecdysozoa (e.g., nematodes and insects) lacks Bcl10, whereas other lineages have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-CC homologs revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient common origin of the entire CBM complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were only found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be related to the original function of the CBM complex. Moreover, the type 1 paracaspase sequences from invertebrate organisms that have CARD-CC/Bcl10 are more similar to vertebrate paracaspases. Functional analysis of protein-protein interactions, NF-κB signaling, and CYLD cleavage for selected invertebrate type 1 paracaspase and Bcl10 homologs supports this scenario and indicates an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. By contrast, many of the known MALT1-associated activities evolved fairly recently, indicating that unknown functions are at the basis of the protein conservation. As a proof-of-concept, we provide initial evidence for a CBM- and NF-κB-independent neuronal function of the Caenorhabditis elegans type 1 paracaspase malt-1. In conclusion, this study shows how evolutionary insights may point at alternative functions of MALT1.	2019	07	29	Front Immunol	Staal	Jens

Autoantigens drive BCR-dependent activation of NF-κB in ABC DLBCL through a kinase signalling cascade of SYK, BTK and PKCβ to promote the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 adaptor complex, which recruits and activates IκB kinase<sup>4-6</sup>. Genome sequencing revealed gain-of-function mutations that target the CD79A and CD79B BCR subunits and the Toll-like receptor signalling adaptor MYD88<sup>5,7</sup>, with MYD88(L265P) being the most prevalent isoform. In a clinical trial, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib produced responses in 37% of cases of ABC<sup>1</sup>. The most striking response rate (80%) was observed in tumours with both CD79B and MYD88(L265P) mutations, but how these mutations cooperate to promote dependence on BCR signalling remains unclear. Here we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and functional proteomics to determine the molecular basis of exceptional clinical responses to ibrutinib. We discovered a new mode of oncogenic BCR signalling in ibrutinib-responsive cell lines and biopsies, coordinated by a multiprotein supercomplex formed by MYD88, TLR9 and the BCR (hereafter termed the My-T-BCR supercomplex). The My-T-BCR supercomplex co-localizes with mTOR on endolysosomes, where it drives pro-survival NF-κB and mTOR signalling. Inhibitors of BCR and mTOR signalling cooperatively decreased the formation and function of the My-T-BCR supercomplex, providing mechanistic insight into their synergistic toxicity for My-T-BCR<sup>+</sup> DLBCL cells. My-T-BCR supercomplexes characterized ibrutinib-responsive malignancies and distinguished ibrutinib responders from non-responders. Our data provide a framework for the rational design of oncogenic signalling inhibitors in molecularly defined subsets of DLBCL.	2019	03	04	Nature	Phelan	James D
29953499	10.1371/journal.pone.0199779	Autocleavage of the paracaspase MALT1 at Arg-781 attenuates NF-κB signaling and regulates the growth of activated B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells.	MALT1 controls several receptors-mediated signaling to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through both its scaffold and protease function. MALT1 protease activity is shown to inactivate several negative regulators of NF-κB signaling and augment NF-κB activation ability. In this study, MALT1 was demonstrated to autoprocess itself in the presence of oligomerization-competent BCL10. Cleavage occurred after Arginine 781 located in the C-terminus of MALT1. Shortened MALT1 cleavage products showed attenuated binding ability with TRAF6. Its NF-κB activation ability was also weakened. Various MALT1 constructs including wild type, catalytically-inactive (MALT1_C464A), cleavage-defective (MALT1_R781L), or truncated (MALT1_1-781) form of MALT1 was introduced into MALT1-knocked-down-Jurkat T cells. Cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L retained its proteolytic and initial IκBα phosphorylation activity as MALT1. Truncated MALT1_1-781 mutant showed weakness in IκBα phosphorylation and the expression of NF-κB targets IL-2 and IFN-γ. Cleavage at R781 was detectable but marginal after activation with TPA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in lymphocytes. However, cleavage at R781 was evident in ABC-DLBCL cells such as OCI-Ly3, HBL-1. HBL-1 cells with induced expression of catalytically-inactive MALT1_C464A or cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L exhibited characteristic of retarded-growth. These findings suggested that cleavage at R781 of MALT1 played a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells.	2018	12	19	PLoS One	Wu	Chun-Hsien
30022982	10.3389/fimmu.2018.01539	BCL10 - Bridging CARDs to Immune Activation.	Since the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) protein was first described in 1999, numerous studies have elucidated its key functions in channeling adaptive and innate immune signaling downstream of CARMA/caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) scaffold proteins. While T and B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) signaling induces the recruitment of BCL10 bound to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)1 to the lymphocyte-specific CARMA1/CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM-1) signalosome, alternative CBM complexes utilize different CARMA/CARD scaffolds in distinct innate or inflammatory pathways. BCL10 constitutes the smallest subunit in all CBM signalosomes, containing a 233 amino acid coding for N-terminal CARD as well as a C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich region. BCL10 forms filaments, thereby aggregating into higher-order clusters that mediate and amplify stimulation-induced signals, ultimately leading to MALT1 protease activation and canonical NF-κB and JNK signaling. BCL10 additionally undergoes extensive post-translational regulation involving phosphorylation, ubiquitination, MALT1-catalyzed cleavage, and degradation. Through these feedback and feed-forward events, BCL10 integrates positive and negative regulatory processes that govern the function as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and destruction of CBM complexes. Thus, BCL10 is a critical regulator for activation as well as termination of immune cell signaling, revealing that its role extends far beyond that of a mere linking factor in CBM complexes.	2019	11	20	Front Immunol	Gehring	Torben
30206119	10.1074/jbc.RA118.004821	Picomolar zinc binding modulates formation of Bcl10-nucleating assemblies of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of CARD9.	The caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) signaling axis is activated in myeloid cells during the innate immune response to a variety of diverse pathogens. This signaling pathway requires a critical caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-CARD interaction between CARD9 and Bcl10 that promotes downstream activation of factors, including NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Despite these insights, CARD9 remains structurally uncharacterized, and little mechanistic understanding of its regulation exists. We unexpectedly found here that the CARD in CARD9 binds to Zn<sup>2+</sup> with picomolar affinity-a concentration comparable with the levels of readily accessible Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol. NMR solution structures of the CARD9-CARD in the apo and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-bound states revealed that Zn<sup>2+</sup> has little effect on the ground-state structure of the CARD; yet the stability of the domain increased considerably upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding, with a concomitant reduction in conformational flexibility. Moreover, Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding inhibited polymerization of the CARD9-CARD into helical assemblies. Here, we also present a 20-Å resolution negative-stain EM (NS-EM) structure of these filamentous assemblies and show that they adopt a similar helical symmetry as reported previously for filaments of the Bcl10 CARD. Using both bulk assays and direct NS-EM visualization, we further show that the CARD9-CARD assemblies can directly template and thereby nucleate Bcl10 polymerization, a capacity considered critical to propagation of the CARD9-Bcl10 signaling cascade. Our findings indicate that CARD9 is a potential target of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling that affects Bcl10 polymerization in innate immune responses.	2019	04	16	J Biol Chem	Holliday	Michael J
30214442	10.3389/fimmu.2018.01927	Holding All the CARDs: How MALT1 Controls CARMA/CARD-Dependent Signaling.	The scaffold proteins CARMA1-3 (encoded by the genes <i>CARD11, -14</i> and -<i>10</i>) and CARD9 play major roles in signaling downstream of receptors with immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). These receptors trigger the formation of oligomeric CARMA/CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complexes via kinases of the PKC family. The CBM in turn regulates gene expression by the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors and controls transcript stability. The paracaspase MALT1 is the only CBM component having an enzymatic (proteolytic) activity and has therefore recently gained attention as a potential drug target. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of the molecular function of the protease MALT1 and summarize how MALT1 scaffold and protease function contribute to the transmission of CBM signals. Finally, we will highlight how dysregulation of MALT1 function can cause pathologies such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, psoriasis, and cancer.	2019	09	19	Front Immunol	Juilland	Mélanie
30279415	10.1038/s41467-018-06573-8	Molecular architecture and regulation of BCL10-MALT1 filaments.	The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex triggers the adaptive immune response in lymphocytes and lymphoma cells. CARD11/CARMA1 acts as a molecular seed inducing BCL10 filaments, but the integration of MALT1 and the assembly of a functional CBM complex has remained elusive. Using cryo-EM we solved the helical structure of the BCL10-MALT1 filament. The structural model of the filament core solved at 4.9 Å resolution identified the interface between the N-terminal MALT1 DD and the BCL10 caspase recruitment domain. The C-terminal MALT1 Ig and paracaspase domains protrude from this core to orchestrate binding of mediators and substrates at the filament periphery. Mutagenesis studies support the importance of the identified BCL10-MALT1 interface for CBM complex assembly, MALT1 protease activation and NF-κB signaling in Jurkat and primary CD4 T-cells. Collectively, we present a model for the assembly and architecture of the CBM signaling complex and how it functions as a signaling hub in T-lymphocytes.	2019	01	22	Nat Commun	Schlauderer	Florian
30283440	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02078	The CBM-opathies-A Rapidly Expanding Spectrum of Human Inborn Errors of Immunity Caused by Mutations in the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 Complex.	The caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11 or CARMA1)-B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-MALT1 paracaspase (MALT1) [CBM] signalosome complex serves as a molecular bridge between cell surface antigen receptor signaling and the activation of the NF-κB, JNK, and mTORC1 signaling axes. This positions the CBM complex as a critical regulator of lymphocyte activation, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Inborn errors in each of the CBM components have now been linked to a diverse group of human primary immunodeficiency diseases termed ""CBM-opathies."" Clinical manifestations range from severe combined immunodeficiency to selective B cell lymphocytosis, atopic disease, and specific humoral defects. This surprisingly broad spectrum of phenotypes underscores the importance of ""tuning"" CBM signaling to preserve immune homeostasis. Here, we review the distinct clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with human CBM complex mutations and introduce new avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention.	2019	09	30	Front Immunol	Lu	Henry Y

30336982	10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.029	MALT1 activation by TRAF6 needs neither BCL10 nor CARD11.	The MALT1 (Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) paracaspase couples antigen receptors on lymphocytes to downstream signaling events. Activation of MALT1 is known to involve stimulus-dependent CBM complex formation, that is, the recruitment of BCL10-bound MALT1 to a CARD-Coiled Coil protein. Beyond this canonical, CBM-dependent mechanism of MALT1 activation, recent studies suggest that MALT1 protease activity may be triggered by alternative mechanisms. For instance, the E3-ligase TRAF6 can activate MALT1 proteolytic function and induce MALT1 auto-cleavage. However, the interplay between CBM and TRAF6 with regard to MALT1 activation has remained incompletely elucidated. Here, by generating CRISPR/Cas9-derived knock-out Jurkat T-cells, we show that TRAF6 was dispensable for CARD11/BCL10-dependent MALT1 activation upon T-cell stimulation. However, ectopically-expressed TRAF6 could induce MALT1 activity in Jurkat T-cells devoid of either CARD11 or BCL10. These data provide unequivocal evidence that TRAF6-mediated MALT1 activation does not require the upstream scaffold CARD11 or the interaction between MALT1 and BCL10. Thus, TRAF6 may be part of a previously unidentified non-canonical pathway that triggers MALT1 protease activity independently of canonical CBM signalosomes.	2019	05	14	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Bardet	Maureen
30386326	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02239	Clinical and Genetic Heterogeneity of <i>CARD14</i> Mutations in Psoriatic Skin Disease.	The CARD: BCL10: MALT1 (CBM) complex is an essential signaling node for maintaining both innate and adaptive immune responses. CBM complex components have gained considerable interest due to the dramatic effects of associated mutations in causing severe lymphomas, immunodeficiencies, carcinomas and inflammatory disease. While MALT1 and BCL10 are ubiquitous proteins, the CARD-containing proteins differ in their tissue expression. CARD14 is primarily expressed in keratinocytes. The CARD14-BCL10-MALT1 complex is activated by upstream pathogen-associated molecular pattern-recognition <i>in vitro</i>, highlighting a potentially crucial role in innate immune defense at the epidermal barrier. Recent findings have demonstrated how CARD14 orchestrates activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways <i>via</i> recruitment of BCL10 and MALT1, leading to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding IL-36γ, IL-8, Ccl20 and anti-microbial peptides. Following the identification of CARD14 gain-of function mutations as responsible for the psoriasis susceptibility locus <i>PSORS2</i>, the past years have witnessed a large volume of case reports and association studies describing CARD14 variants as causal or predisposing to a wide range of inflammatory skin disorders. Recent publications of mouse models also helped to better understand the physiological contribution of CARD14 to psoriasis pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the clinical, genetic and functional aspects of human and murine CARD14 mutations and their contribution to psoriatic disease pathogenesis.	2019	09	30	Front Immunol	Israel	Laura

Activating <i>MYD88</i> mutations are present in 95% of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) patients, and trigger NF-κB through BTK and IRAK. The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is active in <i>MYD88-</i>mutated <i>(MYD88</i> <sup><i>MUT</i></sup> ) WM patients, but shows lower activity in <i>MYD88</i> wild-type (<i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> ) disease. <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> patients also show shorter overall survival, and increased risk of disease transformation in some series. The genomic basis for these findings remains to be clarified. We performed whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of sorted tumor samples from 18 <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> patients and compared findings with WM patients with <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>MUT</i></sup> disease. We identified somatic mutations predicted to activate NF-κB (<i>TBL1XR1</i>, <i>PTPN13, MALT1</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, <i>NFKB2</i>, <i>NFKBIB</i>, <i>NFKBIZ,</i> and <i>UDRL1F</i>), impart epigenomic dysregulation (<i>KMT2D</i>, <i>KMT2C,</i> and <i>KDM6A)</i>, or impair DNA damage repair (<i>TP53</i>, <i>ATM</i>, and <i>TRRAP</i>). Predicted NF-κB activating mutations were downstream of BTK and IRAK, and many overlapped with somatic mutations found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A distinctive transcriptional profile in <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> WM was identified, although most differentially expressed genes overlapped with <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>MUT</i></sup> WM consistent with the many clinical and morphological characteristics that are shared by these WM subgroups. Overall survival was adversely affected by mutations in DNA damage response in <i>MYD88</i> <sup><i>WT</i></sup> WM patients.

30429846	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02366	A <i>CARD9</i> Founder Mutation Disrupts NF-κB Signaling by Inhibiting BCL10 and MALT1 Recruitment and Signalosome Formation.	<b>Background:</b> Inherited CARD9 deficiency constitutes a primary immunodeficiency predisposing uniquely to chronic and invasive fungal infections. Certain mutations are shown to negatively impact CARD9 protein expression and/or NF-κB activation, but the underlying biochemical mechanism remains to be fully understood. <b>Objectives:</b> To investigate a possible founder origin of a known CARD9 R70W mutation in five families of Turkish origin. To explore the biochemical mechanism of immunodeficiency by R70W CARD9. <b>Methods:</b> We performed haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers and SNPs. We designed a model system exploiting a gain-of-function (GOF) CARD9 L213LI mutant that triggers constitutive NF-κB activation, analogous to an oncogenic CARD11 mutant, to study NF-κB signaling and signalosome formation. We performed reporter assays, immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging on HEK cells overexpressing different CARD9 variants. <b>Results:</b> We identified a common haplotype, thus providing evidence for a common Turkish founder. CARD9 R70W failed to activate NF-κB and abrogated NF-κB activation by WT CARD9 and by GOF CARD9. Notably, R70W CARD9 also exerted negative effects on NF-κB activation by CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14. Consistent with the NF-κB results, the R70W mutation prevented GOF CARD9 to pull down the signalosome partner proteins BCL10 and MALT1. This reflected into drastic reduction of BCL10 filamentous assemblies in a cellular context. Indeed, structural analysis revealed that position R70 in CARD9 maps at the putative interface between successive CARD domains in CARD9 filaments. <b>Conclusions:</b> The R70W mutation in CARD9 prevents NF-κB activation by inhibiting productive interactions with downstream BCL10 and MALT1, necessary for assembly of the filamentous CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome.	2019	10	03	Front Immunol	De Bruyne	Marieke
30446641	10.1038/s41467-018-07215-9	Cellular metabolism constrains innate immune responses in early human ontogeny.	Pathogen immune responses are profoundly attenuated in fetuses and premature infants, yet the mechanisms underlying this developmental immaturity remain unclear. Here we show transcriptomic, metabolic and polysome profiling and find that monocytes isolated from infants born early in gestation display perturbations in PPAR-γ-regulated metabolic pathways, limited glycolytic capacity and reduced ribosomal activity. These metabolic changes are linked to a lack of translation of most cytokines and of MALT1 signalosome genes essential to respond to the neonatal pathogen Candida. In contrast, they have little impact on house-keeping phagocytosis functions. Transcriptome analyses further indicate a role for mTOR and its putative negative regulator DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4-Like in regulating these metabolic constraints. Our results provide a molecular basis for the broad susceptibility to multiple pathogens in these infants, and suggest that the fetal immune system is metabolically programmed to avoid energetically costly, dispensable and potentially harmful immune responses during ontogeny.	2018	12	19	Nat Commun	Kan	Bernard
30474008	10.3389/fonc.2018.00498	Post-translational Modifications of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 Complex in Lymphocytes and Activated B-Cell Like Subtype of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Piracy of the NF-κB transcription factors signaling pathway, to sustain its activity, is a mechanism often deployed in B-cell lymphoma to promote unlimited growth and survival. The aggressive activated B-cell like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exploits a multi-protein complex of CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex), which normally conveys NF-κB signaling upon antigen receptors engagement. Once assembled, the CBM also unleashes MALT1 protease activity to finely tune the immune response. As a result, ABC DLBCL tumors develop a profound addiction to NF-κB and to MALT1 enzyme, leaving open a breach for therapeutics. However, the pleiotropic nature of NF-κB jeopardizes the success of its targeting and urges us to develop new strategies. In this review, we discuss how post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the CBM components, as well as, MALT1 proteolytic activity, shape the CBM activity in lymphocytes and ABC DLBCL, and may provide new avenues to restore vulnerability in lymphoma.	2020	10	01	Front Oncol	Thys	An
30515170	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02695	BCL10-CARD11 Fusion Mimics an Active CARD11 Seed That Triggers Constitutive BCL10 Oligomerization and Lymphocyte Activation.	Assembly of the CARD11/CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex upon T or B cell antigen receptor (TCR or BCR) engagement drives lymphocyte activation. Recruitment of pre-assembled BCL10-MALT1 complexes to CARD11 fosters activation of the MALT1 protease and canonical NF-<b>κ</b>B signaling. Structural data and <i>in vitro</i> assays have suggested that CARD11 acts as a seed that nucleates the assembly of BCL10 filaments, but the relevance of these findings for CBM complex assembly in cells remains unresolved. To uncouple cellular CARD11 recruitment of BCL10 and BCL10 filament assembly, we generated a BCL10-CARD11 fusion protein that links the C-terminus of BCL10 to the N-terminus of CARD11. When stably expressed in CARD11 KO Jurkat T cells, the BCL10-CARD11 fusion induced constitutive MALT1 activation. Furthermore, in CARD11 KO BJAB B cells, BCL10-CARD11 promoted constitutive NF-<b>κ</b>B activation to a similar extent as CARD11 containing oncogenic driver mutations. Using structure-guided destructive mutations in the CARD11-BCL10 (CARD11 R35A) or BCL10-BCL10 (BCL10 R42E) interfaces, we demonstrate that chronic activation by the BCL10-CARD11 fusion protein was independent of the CARD11 CARD. However, activation strictly relied upon the ability of the BCL10 CARD to form oligomers. Thus, by combining distinct CARD mutations in the context of constitutively active BCL10-CARD11 fusion proteins, we provide evidence that BCL10-MALT1 recruitment to CARD11 and BCL10 oligomerization are interconnected processes, which bridge the CARD11 seed to downstream pathways in lymphocytes.	2019	10	02	Front Immunol	Seeholzer	Thomas
30553470	10.1016/j.cancergen.2018.08.001	Primary extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas: Many sites, many entities? Clinico-pathological, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic study of 106 cases.	We analyzed the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic features of 106 extranodal (EN) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) from stomach (34 cases), intestine (10), cervico-cephalic region (11), central nervous system (13), testes (21), skin (8), and miscellaneous sites (9). Hans' algorithm and the immunohistochemical double expressor score (DES) for MYC and BCL2 were applied to all cases. A subset of fifty-eight cases were analyzed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific break apart probes for BCL6, MYC, BCL2, CCND1, BCL10 and MALT1 genes. Clinical records were available for all patients. The immunohistochemical study showed that, in our series of EN-DLBCLs, the Hans' subgroup and the DES differed significantly according to the site of origin. At FISH analysis, BCL6 and BCL2 were the most commonly rearranged genes in non-GC and in GC cases, respectively. Gastrointestinal lymphomas displayed the highest rate of gene rearrangements, often with MYC involvement. One testicular DLBCL showed BCL2/MYC double hit. At survival analysis, cerebral and testicular origin was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, Hans' subgroup and other immunohistochemical markers influenced patients' outcome. In conclusion, our data suggest that immunophenotypic, genetic and survival characteristics of EN-DLBCL are related to the specific primary site of the disease.	2019	04	29	Cancer Genet	Magnoli	Francesca
26354285	10.1002/hon.2251	Concomitant high expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling molecules has clinical implications in mantle cell lymphoma.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive disease with frequent relapse. Targeted therapies against B-cell receptor (BCR) molecules have demonstrated improved outcomes in relapsed cases. However, clinical responses are slow and selective, with failure to attain complete remission in a significant subset of patients. Complex interaction of BCR signal transduction with toll-like receptor (TLR) and other pathways in MCL remains unknown, thus averting progress in development of targeted therapies. We have performed detailed digital quantification of BCR/TLR signalling molecules and their effector pathways in a cohort (n = 81) of MCL patients and correlated these data with overall survival. Hierarchical clustering model based on BCR/TLR genes revealed two distinct (BCR<sup>high</sup> and BCR<sup>low</sup> ) subsets of patients (n = 32; 40%) with significant differences in expression (&gt;1.5-fold change; p &lt; 0.05). Higher levels of BTK/SYK/BLNK/CARD11/PLCG signalosome and lower expression of MALT1/BCL10 genes suggested tonic pattern of BCR activation. Amplified expression of TLR6/TLR7/TLR9 was noted in concert with hyper-responsiveness of BCR machinery. MYD88, a key TLR adaptor molecule, was not upregulated in any of these clusters, which may suggest a 'cross-talk' between BCR and TLR pathways. In sync with BCR/TLR signalling, we recorded significantly enhanced expression of genes associated with NF-kB pathway in BCR<sup>high</sup> subset of MCL patients. On univariate analysis, the BCR<sup>high</sup> patients showed a trend towards inferior clinical response to a standardized treatment protocol, compared with the BCR<sup>low</sup> group (log rank, p = 0.043). In conclusion, we have identified hyperactive BCR/TLR signalling pathways and their effector downstream targets in a subset of MCL patients and associated it with poor clinical outcomes. Our study provides quantitative evidence at RNA expression level of possible concomitant collaboration between TLR and BCR signalling molecules in MCL. These data will provide further insights for future functional studies and, hence, development of targeted therapies for MCL patients.

BCL10 was recently demonstrated to be a biomarker for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but whether altered BCL10 expression can be detected in cell block specimens is unclear. Here, we report a pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma with cytological findings that showed BCL10 expression in a cell block. A 72-year-old man presented with a pancreatic tumor and underwent endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with additional passes performed for cell block preparation. The EUS-FNA cytology showed loose cohesive clusters with focal acinar- or gland-like-structures and prominent nucleoli. The preoperative diagnosis was well differentiated adenocarcinoma, and he underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histological examination revealed an acinar tumor structure with tumor cells staining positive for BCL10 and trypsin. The cell block specimen also demonstrated strong and diffuse BCL10-positive staining. Based on these findings, this tumor was diagnosed as acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. This case demonstrates that BCL10 expression within cell blocks facilitates a differential diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma. Diagn.

27864294	10.1182/blood-2016-05-718775	B-cell receptor-driven MALT1 activity regulates MYC signaling in mantle cell lymphoma.	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a mature B-cell lymphoma characterized by poor clinical outcome. Recent studies revealed the importance of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in maintaining MCL survival. However, it remains unclear which role MALT1, an essential component of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex that links BCR signaling to the NF-κB pathway, plays in the biology of MCL. Here we show that a subset of MCLs is addicted to MALT1, as its inhibition by either RNA or pharmacologic interference induced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression profiling following MALT1 inhibition demonstrated that MALT1 controls an MYC-driven gene expression network predominantly through increasing MYC protein stability. Thus, our analyses identify a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism of MYC expression. Investigating primary mouse splenocytes, we could demonstrate that MALT1-induced MYC regulation is not restricted to MCL, but represents a common mechanism. MYC itself is pivotal for MCL survival because its downregulation and pharmacologic inhibition induced cytotoxicity in all MCL models. Collectively, these results provide a strong mechanistic rationale to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the MALT1-MYC axis in MCL patients.	2017	08	23	Blood	Dai	Beiying
27873317	10.1002/path.4852	The B-cell-activating factor signalling pathway is associated with Helicobacter pylori independence in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma without t(11;18)(q21;q21).	We previously reported that activation of the B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) pathway upregulates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and induces BCL3 and BCL10 nuclear translocation in Helicobacter pylori (HP)-independent gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumours with evidence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). However, the significance of BAFF expression in HP independence of gastric low-grade MALT lymphomas without t(11;18)(q21;q21) remains unexplored. Sixty-four patients who underwent successful HP eradication for localized HP-positive gastric MALT lymphomas without t(11;18)(q21;q21) were studied. BAFF expression was significantly higher in the HP-independent group than in the HP-dependent group [22/26 (84.6%) versus 8/38 (21.1%); p &lt; 0.001]. Similarly, BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) expression (p = 0.004) and nuclear BCL3 (p = 0.004), BCL10 (p &lt; 0.001), NF-κB (p65) (p = 0.001) and NF-κB (p52) (p = 0.005) expression were closely correlated with the HP independence of these tumours. Moreover, BAFF overexpression was significantly associated with BAFF-R expression and nuclear BCL3, BCL10, NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB (p52) expression. These findings were further validated in an independent cohort, including 40 HP-dependent cases and 18 HP-independent cases of gastric MALT lymphoma without t(11;18)(q21;q21). The biological significance of BAFF signalling in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-negative lymphoma cells was further studied in two types of lymphoma B cell: OCI-Ly3 [non-germinal centre B-cell origin DLBCL without t(11;18)(q21;q21) cell line] and MA-1 [t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1-positive DLBCL cell line]. In both cell lines, we found that BAFF activated the canonical NF-κB and AKT pathways, and induced the formation of BCL10-BCL3 complexes, which translocated to the nucleus. BCL10 and BCL3 nuclear translocation and NF-κB (p65) transactivation were inhibited by either LY294002 or by silencing BCL3 or BCL10 with small interfering RNA. BAFF also activated non-canonical NF-κB pathways (p52) through tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 degradation, NF-κB-inducing kinase accumulation, inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) α/β phosphorylation and NF-κB p100 processing in both cell lines. Our data indicate that the autocrine BAFF signal transduction pathway contributes to HP independence in gastric MALT lymphomas without the t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation.

27939769	10.1016/j.jid.2016.09.031	CARD14-Mediated Activation of Paracaspase MALT1 in Keratinocytes: Implications for Psoriasis.	Mutations in caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 14(CARD14) have been linked to susceptibility to psoriasis. CARD14 is an intracellular scaffold protein that regulates proinflammatory gene expression. Recent studies have offered novel insights into the mechanisms of CARD14-mediated signaling in keratinocytes and the molecular impact of psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations. CARD14 forms a signaling complex with BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1, and this process is enhanced upon pathogenic CARD14 mutation, culminating in the activation of MALT1 protease activity and psoriasis-associated gene expression. This review summarizes the current knowledge of CARD14/MALT1-mediated signaling in keratinocytes and its therapeutic implications in psoriasis.	2017	07	26	J Invest Dermatol	Van Nuffel	Elien
28052131	10.1371/journal.pone.0169026	Two Antagonistic MALT1 Auto-Cleavage Mechanisms Reveal a Role for TRAF6 to Unleash MALT1 Activation.	The paracaspase MALT1 has arginine-directed proteolytic activity triggered by engagement of immune receptors. Recruitment of MALT1 into activation complexes is required for MALT1 proteolytic function. Here, co-expression of MALT1 in HEK293 cells, either with activated CARD11 and BCL10 or with TRAF6, was used to explore the mechanism of MALT1 activation at the molecular level. This work identified a prominent self-cleavage site of MALT1 isoform A (MALT1A) at R781 (R770 in MALT1B) and revealed that TRAF6 can activate MALT1 independently of the CBM. Intramolecular cleavage at R781/R770 removes a C-terminal TRAF6-binding site in both MALT1 isoforms, leaving MALT1B devoid of the two key interaction sites with TRAF6. A previously identified auto-proteolysis site of MALT1 at R149 leads to deletion of the death-domain, thereby abolishing interaction with BCL10. By using MALT1 isoforms and cleaved fragments thereof, as well as TRAF6 WT and mutant forms, this work shows that TRAF6 induces N-terminal auto-proteolytic cleavage of MALT1 at R149 and accelerates MALT1 protein turnover. The MALT1 fragment generated by N-terminal self-cleavage at R149 was labile and displayed enhanced signaling properties that required an intact K644 residue, previously shown to be a site for mono-ubiquitination of MALT1. Conversely, C-terminal self-cleavage at R781/R770 hampered the ability for self-cleavage at R149 and stabilized MALT1 by hindering interaction with TRAF6. C-terminal self-cleavage had limited impact on MALT1A but severely reduced MALT1B proteolytic and signaling functions. It also abrogated NF-κB activation by N-terminally cleaved MALT1A. Altogether, this study provides further insights into mechanisms that regulate the scaffolding and activation cycle of MALT1. It also emphasizes the reduced functional capacity of MALT1B as compared to MALT1A.	2017	08	28	PLoS One	Ginster	Stefanie
28158919	10.1111/jcmm.13050	Zinc rescues obesity-induced cardiac hypertrophy via stimulating metallothionein to suppress oxidative stress-activated BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK pathway.	Obesity often leads to obesity-related cardiac hypertrophy (ORCH), which is suppressed by zinc-induced inactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which zinc inactivates p38 MAPK to prevent ORCH. Mice (4-week old) were fed either high fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal fat) or normal diet (ND, 10% kcal fat) containing variable amounts of zinc (deficiency, normal and supplement) for 3 and 6 months. P38 MAPK siRNA and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were used to suppress p38 MAPK activity in vitro and in vivo, respectively. HFD activated p38 MAPK and increased expression of B-cell lymphoma/CLL 10 (BCL10) and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9). These responses were enhanced by zinc deficiency and attenuated by zinc supplement. Administration of SB203580 to HFD mice or specific siRNA in palmitate-treated cardiomyocytes eliminated the HFD and zinc deficiency activation of p38 MAPK, but did not significantly impact the expression of BCL10 and CARD9. In cultured cardiomyocytes, inhibition of BCL10 expression by siRNA prevented palmitate-induced increased p38 MAPK activation and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression. In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAPK prevented ANP expression, but did not affect BCL10 expression. Deletion of metallothionein abolished the protective effect of zinc on palmitate-induced up-regulation of BCL10 and phospho-p38 MAPK. HFD and zinc deficiency synergistically induce ORCH by increasing oxidative stress-mediated activation of BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK signalling. Zinc supplement ameliorates ORCH through activation of metallothionein to repress oxidative stress-activated BCL10 expression and p38 MAPK activation.	2018	02	21	J Cell Mol Med	Wang	Shudong

But there is substantial controversy about its safety. <i>Methods.</i> We investigated whether the <i>κ</i>-carrageenan could enhance lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-8 expression by studying its actions on the TLR4-NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway. The aggravating effect of <i>κ</i>-carrageenan on <i>Citrobacter freundii</i> DBS100-induced intestinal inflammation was also investigated in a mouse model. <i>Results.</i> Our data show that <i>κ</i>-carrageenan pretreatment promoted LPS-induced IL-8 expression in HT-29 cells. Although CD14, MD-2, and TLR4 were upregulated, the binding of LPS was not enhanced. However, the pathway of Bcl10-NF-<i>κ</i>B was triggered. Interestingly, <i>κ</i>-carrageenan competitively blocked the binding of FITC-LPS. Furthermore, pretreatment with <i>κ</i>-carrageenan for one week previous to gavage with <i>C. freundii</i> DBS100 markedly aggravated weight loss, mortality, and colonic damage. The secretion of cytokines was unbalanced and the ratio of Tregs was decreased significantly. In addition, <i>κ</i>-carrageenan, together with <i>C. freundii</i> DBS100, enhanced the transcription and secretion of TLR4 and NF-<i>κ</i>B. <i>Conclusions</i>. <i>κ</i>-Carrageenan can synergistically activate LPS-induced inflammatory through the Bcl10-NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway, as indicated by its aggravation of <i>C. freundii</i> DBS100-induced colitis in mice. <i>General Significance.</i> Our results suggest that <i>κ</i>-carrageenan serves as a potential inflammatory agent that magnifies existing intestinal inflammation.	2017	07	10	Mediators Inflamm	Wu	Wei
28230860	10.1038/cddis.2017.51	CARMA2sh and ULK2 control pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognition in human keratinocytes: psoriasis-linked CARMA2sh mutants escape ULK2 censorship.	The molecular complexes formed by specific members of the family of CARMA proteins, the CARD domain-containing adapter molecule BCL10 and MALT1 (CBM complex) represent a central hub in regulating activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-κB. Recently, missense mutations in CARMA2sh have been shown to cause psoriasis in a dominant manner and with high penetrancy. Here, we demonstrate that in human keratinocytes CARMA2sh plays an essential role in the signal transduction pathway that connects pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognition to NF-κB activation. We also find that the serine/threonine kinase ULK2 binds to and phosphorylates CARMA2sh, thereby inhibiting its capacity to activate NF-κB by promoting lysosomal degradation of BCL10, which is essential for CARMA2sh-mediated NF-κB signaling. Remarkably, CARMA2sh mutants associated with psoriasis escape ULK2 inhibition. Finally, we show that a peptide blocking CARD-mediated BCL10 interactions reduces the capacity of psoriasis-linked CARMA2sh mutants to activate NF-κB. Our work elucidates a fundamental signaling mechanism operating in human keratinocytes and opens to novel potential tools for the therapeutical treatment of human skin disorders.	2017	10	30	Cell Death Dis	Scudiero	Ivan
28288707	10.1016/j.beha.2016.09.002	MALT lymphoma: Genetic abnormalities, immunological stimulation and molecular mechanism.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) occurs at diverse anatomic sites and is closely associated with several distinct chronic inflammatory disorders. Both the acquired genetic abnormalities and active chronic immunological responses play a critical role in the development of MALT lymphoma, interestingly by dysregulating similar molecular mechanisms. The three translocations seen in MALT lymphoma, namely t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/BIRC3 (API2)-MALT1 are capable of activating both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. TNFAIP3 (A20) inactivation by deletion and/or mutation abolishes its negative regulation to several signalling including BCR and TLR, which activate the canonical NF-κB pathway. Similarly, the immunological responses also activate the canonical NF-κB pathway via surface antigen receptor and TLR, and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by T-cell help and BAFFR. There is also emerging evidence indicating oncogenic cooperation between the above genetic changes and immunological stimulation in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma.	2017	10	09	Best Pract Res Clin Haematol	Du	Ming-Qing
28672935	10.3892/etm.2017.4464	Next-generation sequencing reveals lymph node metastasis associated genetic markers in colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent type of cancer in the United States. Early diagnosis of lymph node metastases is essential to improve the prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer. Therefore, the present study aimed to screen genetic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and mRNA expression, associated with lymph node metastases in patients with colorectal cancer to enable an early diagnosis. Targeted next-generation sequencing was applied to capture SNPs and CNVs in tumor-related candidate genes within tumor tissues from 39 colorectal cancer patients; reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the specific mRNA level of tumor-related candidate genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor C, cyclin-A2, Interleukin-2, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) on chromosome 4. The SNPs in solute carrier family 28 member 3 (SLC28A3), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), ribonucleotide reductase regulators subunit M2 (RRM2), PMS1 homolog 2 (PMS2), cytidine deaminase (CDA), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), heterogenous ribonucleoprotein particle-associated with lethal yellow (RALY), Siglec-3 (CD33), B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10), ETS variant 1 (ETV1), macrophage stimulating 1 receptor 1 (MST1R), lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), U6 small nuclear RNA-associated Sm-like protein 3 (LSM3), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 1 (MAP3K1) were significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis (P&lt;0.05). EGF and NFKB1 were both observed to be significantly downregulated in the lymph node metastases group (P&lt;0.05). Although no association between CNVs and lymph node metastases in patients with colorectal cancer was observed in the present study, SNPs in SLC28A3, BRCA1, RRM2, PMS2, CDA, EPHX1, RALY, CD33, BCL10, ETV1, MST1R, KMT2B, BCL2, LSM3, TTF1 and MAP3K1 were significantly associated with colorectal cancer. Downregulation of EGF and NFKB1 was also identified to be associated with lymph node metastases in colorectal cancer. The findings of the current study provide a scientific basis for the clinical inspection of lymphatic metastasis and prognosis prediction, intervention and guidance therapy for patients with colorectal cancer.	2020	09	30	Exp Ther Med	Xie	Ni

28765954	10.3892/mmr.2017.7116	In vitro reconstitution of interactions in the CARD9 signalosome.	The caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD)‑containing protein 9 (CARD9) signalosome is composed of CARD9, B‑cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa‑associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1). The CARD9 signalosome has been reported to exert critical functions in the immunoreceptor tyrosine‑based activation motif‑coupled receptor‑mediated activation of myeloid cells, through nuclear factor‑κB pathways during innate immunity processes. During CARD9 signalosome assembly, BCL10 has been revealed to function as an adaptor protein and to interact with CARD9 via CARD‑CARD interactions; BCL10 also interacts with MALT1 via its C‑terminal Ser/Thr‑rich region and the first immunoglobulin domain of MALT1. The CARD9 signalosome is implicated in critical biological processes; however, its structural and biochemical characteristics have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, CARD9 and BCL10 CARDs were successfully purified and characterized, and their biochemical properties were investigated. In addition, CARD9‑BCL10 complexes were reconstituted in vitro under low salt and pH conditions. Furthermore, based on structural modeling data, a scheme was proposed to describe the interactions between CARD9 and BCL10. This provides a further understanding of the mechanism of how the CARD9 signalosome may be assembled.	2018	05	21	Mol Med Rep	Park	Jin Hee
29084984	10.1038/s41598-017-14102-8	First-line antibiotic therapy in Helicobacter pylori-negative low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.	First-line antibiotic treatment for eradicating Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is effective in HP-positive low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma), but its role in HP-negative cases is uncertain. In this exploratory retrospective study, we assessed the outcome and potential predictive biomarkers for 25 patients with HP-negative localized gastric MALToma who received first-line HP eradication (HPE) therapy. An HP-negative status was defined as negative results on histology, rapid urease test, <sup>13</sup>C urea breath test, and serology. We observed an antibiotic response (complete remission [CR], number = 8; partial remission, number = 1) in 9 (36.0%) out of 25 patients. A t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation was detected in 7 (43.8%) of 16 antibiotic-unresponsive cases, but in none of the 9 antibiotic-responsive cases (P = 0.027). Nuclear BCL10 expression was significantly higher in antibiotic-unresponsive tumors than in antibiotic-responsive tumors (14/16 [87.5%] vs. 1/9 [11.1%]; P = 0.001). Nuclear NF-κB expression was also significantly higher in antibiotic-unresponsive tumors than in antibiotic-responsive tumors (12/16 [75.0%] vs. 1/9 [11.1%]; P = 0.004). A substantial portion of patients with HP-negative gastric MALToma responded to first-line HPE. In addition to t(11;18)(q21;q21), BCL10 and NF-κB are useful immunohistochemical biomarkers to predict antibiotic-unresponsive status in this group of tumors.	2019	07	30	Sci Rep	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
29194363	10.3390/ijms18122581	The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF7 Negatively Regulates CARD14/CARMA2sh Signaling.	The three CARD-containing MAGUK (CARMA) proteins function as scaffolding molecules that regulate activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Recently, mutations in CARMA2 have been linked to psoriasis susceptibility due to their acquired altered capacity to activate NF-κB. By means of two-hybrid screening with yeast, we identified RING finger protein 7 (RNF7) as an interactor of CARMA2. We present evidence that RNF7 functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB-activating capacity of CARMA2. Mechanistically, RNF7 influences CARMA2 signaling by regulating the ubiquitination state of MALT1 and the NF-κB-regulatory molecule NEMO. Interestingly, CARMA2<i>short</i> (CARMA2<i>sh</i>) mutants associated with psoriasis susceptibility escape the negative control exerted by RNF7. In conclusion, our findings identify a new mechanism through which the ability of CARMA2 to activate NF-κB is regulated, which could have significant implications for our understanding of why mutations of this protein trigger human psoriasis.	2018	07	11	Int J Mol Sci	Telesio	Gianluca
29225710	10.1007/s12308-017-0302-2	Novel developments in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL), mostly represented by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, also referred to as MALT lymphoma, is a clinically heterogeneous entity within the group of low-grade B cell lymphomas that arises in a wide range of different extranodal sites, including the stomach, lung, ocular adnexa, and skin. It represents the third most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western world, and the median age of occurrence is around 60 years. One characteristic aspect in a subset of EMZL detectable in about 25% of the cases is the presence of specific chromosomal translocations involving the genes <i>MALT1</i> and <i>BCL10</i>, which lead to activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Another unique aspect is that several infectious agents, such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> in the case of gastric EMZL, and autoimmune disorders, like Sjögren syndrome, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this cancer. Recent findings as summarized in this review have further improved our understanding of the complex pathobiology of this disease and have been essential to better define novel treatment strategies. In addition, many of these specific features are currently being implemented for the diagnosis of EMZL.	2020	10	01	J Hematop	Schreuder	Max I
29340061	10.18632/oncotarget.22799	Analysis of the mutational landscape of classic Hodgkin lymphoma identifies disease heterogeneity and potential therapeutic targets.	Defining the mutational landscape of classic Hodgkin lymphoma is still a major research goal. New targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques may identify pathogenic mechanisms and new therapeutic opportunities related to this disease. We describe the mutational profile of a series of 57 cHL cases, enriched in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Overall, the results confirm the presence of strong genomic heterogeneity. However, several variants were consistently detected in genes related to relevant signaling pathways, such as GM-CSF/IL-3, CBP/EP300, JAK/STAT, NF-kappaB, and numerous variants of genes affecting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, such as <i>BTK</i>, <i>CARD11</i>, <i>BCL10</i>, among others. This unexpectedly high prevalence of mutations affecting the BCR pathway suggests some requirement for active BCR signaling for cHL cell viability. Additionally, incubation of a panel of cHL cellular models with selective BTK inhibitors <i>in vitro</i> constrains cell proliferation and causes cell death. Our results indicate new pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities in this disease.	2019	11	20	Oncotarget	Mata	Elena
26392569	10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-15-0229-T	The CBM Complex Underwrites NF-κB Activation to Promote HER2-Associated Tumor Malignancy.	The HER2/Neu protein is overexpressed in a large fraction of human breast cancers. NF-κB is one of several transcription factors that are aberrantly activated in HER2-positive breast cancers; however, the molecular mechanism by which HER2 activates NF-κB remains unclear. The CARMA3-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex is required for GPCR- and EGFR-induced NF-κB activation. In the current study, the role of the CBM complex in HER2-mediated NF-κB activation and HER2-positive breast cancer was investigated. Interestingly, HER2-mediated NF-κB activation requires protein kinase C (PKC) activity rather than AKT activity. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, it was shown that the CBM complex is required for HER2-induced NF-κB activation and functionally contributes to multiple properties of malignancy, such as proliferation, avoidance of apoptosis, migration, and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CARMA3-mediated NF-κB activity was required for the upregulation of two matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP1 and MMP13, both of which contribute to tumor metastasis. To further access the physiologic role of CBM complex-mediated NF-κB activation in HER2-positive breast cancer progression, Malt1 knockout mice (Malt1(-/-)) were crossed with MMTV-Neu mice, in which mammary tumors spontaneously developed with HER2 overexpression. We observed delayed onset and prolonged progression time in mammary tumors in Malt1 knockout mice compared with control mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that the CBM complex is a crucial component mediating HER2-induced NF-κB signaling and tumor malignancy in HER2-positive breast cancer. The CBM complex bridges key signaling pathways to confer malignant phenotypes and metastatic potential in HER2-associated breast cancer.	2016	10	18	Mol Cancer Res	Pan	Deng
26521038	10.1016/j.jaci.2015.09.016	Impaired RASGRF1/ERK-mediated GM-CSF response characterizes CARD9 deficiency in French-Canadians.	Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency conferring human susceptibility to invasive fungal disease, including spontaneous central nervous system candidiasis (sCNSc). However, clinical characterization of sCNSc is variable, hindering its recognition. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of the bases for this susceptibility has remained elusive. We sought to comprehensively characterize sCNSc and to dissect the mechanisms by which a hypomorphic CARD9 mutation causes susceptibility to Candida species. We describe the clinical and radiologic findings of sCNSc caused by CARD9 deficiency in a French-Canadian cohort. We performed genetic, cellular, and molecular analyses to further decipher its pathophysiology. In our French-Canadian series (n = 4) sCNSc had onset in adulthood (median, 38 years) and was often misinterpreted radiologically as brain malignancies; 1 patient had additional novel features (eg, endophthalmitis and osteomyelitis). CARD9 deficiency resulted from a hypomorphic p.Y91H mutation and allelic imbalance established in this population through founder effects. We demonstrate a consistent cellular phenotype of impaired GM-CSF responses. The ability of CARD9 to complex with B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is intact in our series, arguing against its involvement in susceptibility to fungi. Instead, we show that the p.Y91H mutation impairs the ability of CARD9 to complex with Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1), leading to impaired activation of nuclear factor κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in monocytes and subsequent GM-CSF responses. Successful treatment of a second patient with adjunctive GM-CSF bolsters the clinical relevance of these findings. Hypomorphic CARD9 deficiency caused by p.Y91H results in adult-onset disease with variable penetrance and expressivity. Our findings establish the CARD9/RASGRF1/ERK/GM-CSF axis as critical to the pathophysiology of sCNSc.	2016	08	29	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Gavino	Christina
26767426	10.1016/j.jid.2015.12.027	MALT1 Protease Activity Controls the Expression of Inflammatory Genes in Keratinocytes upon Zymosan Stimulation.	The protease activity of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) plays an important role in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation by controlling the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and is thus essential for the expression of inflammatory target genes. MALT1 is not only present in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, but is ubiquitously expressed. Here we report that stimulation with zymosan or Staphylococcus aureus induced MALT1 protease activity in human primary keratinocytes. Inhibition of the Src family of kinases or novel protein kinase C isoforms as well as silencing of CARMA2 or BCL10 interfered with activation of MALT1 protease. Silencing or inhibition of MALT1 protease strongly decreased the expression of important inflammatory genes such as TNFα, IL-17C, CXCL8 and HBD-2. MALT1-inhibited cells were unable to mount an antimicrobial response upon zymosan stimulation or phorbolester/ionomycin treatment, demonstrating a central role of MALT1 protease activity in keratinocyte immunity and suggesting MALT1 as a potential target in inflammatory skin diseases. 	2016	08	16	J Invest Dermatol	Schmitt	Anja
26771713	10.1080/15384101.2015.1121322	BCL10 is recruited to sites of DNA damage to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair.	Recent studies have found BCL10 can localize to the nucleus and that this is linked to tumor aggression and poorer prognosis. These studies suggest that BCL10 localization plays a novel role in the nucleus that may contribute to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that BCL10 functions as part of the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that BCL10 facilitates the rapid recruitment of RPA, BRCA1 and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage. Furthermore, we also found that ATM phosphorylates BCL10 in response to DNA damage. Functionally, BCL10 promoted DNA double-strand breaks repair, enhancing cell survival after DNA damage. Taken together our results suggest a novel role for BCL10 in the repair of DNA lesions. 	2016	10	13	Cell Cycle	Ismail	Ismail Hassan

26776161	10.1038/onc.2015.493	Oncogenic CARMA1 couples NF-κB and β-catenin signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	Constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a hallmark of the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recurrent oncogenic mutations are found in the scaffold protein CARMA1 (CARD11) that connects B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling to the canonical NF-κB pathway. We asked how far additional downstream processes are activated and contribute to the oncogenic potential of DLBCL-derived CARMA1 mutants. To this end, we expressed oncogenic CARMA1 in the NF-κB negative DLBCL lymphoma cell line BJAB. By a proteomic approach we identified recruitment of β-catenin and its destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN1, CK1α and GSK3β to oncogenic CARMA1. Recruitment of the β-catenin destruction complex was independent of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex formation or constitutive NF-κB activation and promoted the stabilization of β-catenin. The β-catenin destruction complex was also recruited to CARMA1 in ABC DLBCL cell lines, which coincided with elevated β-catenin expression. In line, β-catenin was frequently detected in non-GCB DLBCL biopsies that rely on chronic BCR signaling. Increased β-catenin amounts alone were not sufficient to induce classical WNT target gene signatures, but could augment TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activation in response to WNT signaling. In conjunction with NF-κB, β-catenin enhanced expression of immunosuppressive interleukin-10 and suppressed antitumoral CCL3, indicating that β-catenin can induce a favorable tumor microenvironment. Thus, parallel activation of NF-κB and β-catenin signaling by gain-of-function mutations in CARMA1 augments WNT stimulation and is required for regulating the expression of distinct NF-κB target genes to trigger cell-intrinsic and extrinsic processes that promote DLBCL lymphomagenesis.	2017	08	14	Oncogene	Bognar	M K
26884334	10.1074/jbc.M116.717322	Intramolecular Interactions and Regulation of Cofactor Binding by the Four Repressive Elements in the Caspase Recruitment Domain-containing Protein 11 (CARD11) Inhibitory Domain.	The CARD11 signaling scaffold transmits signaling between antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes and the transcription factor NF-κB during the adaptive immune response. CARD11 activity is controlled by an inhibitory domain (ID), which participates in intramolecular interactions and prevents cofactor binding prior to receptor triggering. Oncogenic CARD11 mutations associated with the activated B cell-like subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma somehow perturb ID-mediated autoinhibition to confer CARD11 with the dysregulated spontaneous signaling to NF-κB that is required for the proliferation and survival of the lymphoma. Here, we investigate how the four repressive elements (REs) we have discovered in the CARD11 ID function to inhibit CARD11 activity with cooperativity and redundancy. We find that each RE contributes to the maintenance of the closed inactive state of CARD11 that predominates in the absence of receptor engagement. Each RE also contributes to the prevention of Bcl10 binding in the basal unstimulated state. RE1, RE2, and RE3 participate in intramolecular interactions with other CARD11 domains and share domain targets for binding. Remarkably, diffuse large B cell lymphoma-associated gain-of-function mutations in the caspase recruitment domain, LATCH, or coiled coil can perturb intramolecular interactions mediated by multiple REs, suggesting how single amino acid oncogenic CARD11 mutations can perturb or bypass the action of redundant inhibitory REs to achieve the level of hyperactive CARD11 signaling required to support lymphoma growth. 	2016	10	07	J Biol Chem	Jattani	Rakhi P
26936881	10.4049/jimmunol.1403165	Usp9X Is Required for Lymphocyte Activation and Homeostasis through Its Control of ZAP70 Ubiquitination and PKCβ Kinase Activity.	To achieve a durable adaptive immune response, lymphocytes must undergo clonal expansion and induce a survival program that enables the persistence of Ag-experienced cells and the development of memory. During the priming phase of this response, CD4(+)T lymphocytes either remain tolerized or undergo clonal expansion. In this article, we show that Usp9X functions as a positive regulatory switch during T lymphocyte priming through removal of inhibitory monoubiquitination from ZAP70. In the absence of Usp9X, an increased amount of ZAP70 localized to early endosomes consistent with the role of monoubiquitin in endocytic sorting. Usp9X becomes competent to deubiquitinate ZAP70 through TCR-dependent phosphorylation and enhancement of its catalytic activity and association with the LAT signalosome. In B lymphocytes, Usp9X is required for the induction of PKCβ kinase activity after BCR-dependent activation. Accordingly, inUsp9Xknockout B cells, there was a significant reduction in phospho-CARMA1 levels that resulted in reduced CARMA1/Bcl-10/MALT-1 complex formation and NF-κB-dependent cell survival. The pleiotropic effect of Usp9X during Ag-receptor signaling highlights its importance for the development of an effective and durable adaptive immune response.	2016	08	16	J Immunol	Naik	Edwina
26947079	10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.031	CARMA3 Is a Host Factor Regulating the Balance of Inflammatory and Antiviral Responses against Viral Infection.	Host response to RNA virus infection is sensed by RNA sensors such as RIG-I, which induces MAVS-mediated NF-κB and IRF3 activation to promote inflammatory and antiviral responses, respectively. Here, we have found that CARMA3, a scaffold protein previously shown to mediate NF-κB activation induced by GPCR and EGFR, positively regulates MAVS-induced NF-κB activation. However, our data suggest that CARMA3 sequesters MAVS from forming high-molecular-weight aggregates, thereby suppressing TBK1/IRF3 activation. Interestingly, following NF-κB activation upon virus infection, CARMA3 is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation, which releases MAVS to activate IRF3. When challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza A virus, CARMA3-deficient mice showed reduced disease symptoms compared to those of wild-type mice as a result of less inflammation and a stronger ability to clear infected virus. Altogether, our results reveal the role of CARMA3 in regulating the balance of host antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses against RNA virus infection. 	2016	12	14	Cell Rep	Jiang	Changying
27006117	10.1242/jcs.185025	The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 during antigen receptor signaling.	Antigen-receptor-mediated activation of lymphocytes relies on a signalosome comprising CARMA1 (also known as CARD11), BCL10 and MALT1 (the CBM complex). The CBM activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors by recruiting the 'linear ubiquitin assembly complex' (LUBAC), and unleashes MALT1 paracaspase activity. Although MALT1 enzyme shapes NF-κB signaling, lymphocyte activation and contributes to lymphoma growth, the identity of its substrates continues to be elucidated. Here, we report that the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 (also known as RBCK1) is cleaved by MALT1 following antigen receptor engagement. HOIL1 is also constitutively processed in the 'activated B-cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which exhibits aberrant MALT1 activity. We further show that the overexpression of MALT1-insensitive HOIL1 mitigates T-cell-receptor-mediated NF-κB activation and subsequent cytokine production in lymphocytes. Thus, our results unveil HOIL1 as a negative regulator of lymphocyte activation cleaved by MALT1. This cleavage could therefore constitute an appealing therapeutic target for modulating immune responses.	2017	07	31	J Cell Sci	Douanne	Tiphaine

27070702	10.1016/j.ccell.2016.03.006	Targeting Non-proteolytic Protein Ubiquitination for the Treatment of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.	Chronic active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, a hallmark of the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), engages the CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 (CBM) adapter complex to activate IκB kinase (IKK) and the classical NF-κB pathway. Here we show that the CBM complex includes the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2, which are essential mediators of BCR-dependent NF-κB activity in ABC DLBCL. cIAP1/2 attach K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on themselves and on BCL10, resulting in the recruitment of IKK and the linear ubiquitin chain ligase LUBAC, which is essential for IKK activation. SMAC mimetics target cIAP1/2 for destruction, and consequently suppress NF-κB and selectively kill BCR-dependent ABC DLBCL lines, supporting their clinical evaluation in patients with ABC DLBCL. 	2016	09	08	Cancer Cell	Yang	Yibin
27071417	10.1042/BCJ20160270	Psoriasis mutations disrupt CARD14 autoinhibition promoting BCL10-MALT1-dependent NF-κB activation.	Inherited and de novo mutations in the CARD14 gene promote the development of psoriasis, an inflammatory disease of the skin. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 14 (CARD14) is a member of the CARMA protein family that includes the structurally related CARD11 adaptor that mediates NF-κB activation by antigen receptors. We investigated the mechanism by which CARD14 mutation in psoriasis activates NF-κB. In contrast with wild-type CARD14, CARD14(E138A) and CARD14(G117S) psoriasis mutants interacted constitutively with BCL10 and MALT1, and triggered BCL10- and MALT1-dependent activation of NF-κB in keratinocytes. These alterations disrupted the inhibitory effect of the CARD14 linker region (LR) on NF-κB activation by facilitating BCL10 binding. Therefore, psoriasis mutations activated CARD14 by a mechanism analogous to oncogenic CARD11 mutations in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. CARD14(E138A) also stimulated MALT1 paracaspase activity and activated both ERK1/2 and p38α MAP kinases. Inhibition of MALT1 with mepazine reduced CARD14(E138A)-induced expression of specific psoriasis-associated transcripts in keratinocytes. Our results establish the mechanism whereby gain-of-function CARD14 variants, which induce psoriatic disease in affected individuals, activate pro-inflammatory signalling.	2017	05	15	Biochem J	Howes	Ashleigh
27092298	10.3389/fcimb.2016.00039	Mechanistic Insights into the Role of C-Type Lectin Receptor/CARD9 Signaling in Human Antifungal Immunity.	Human CARD9 deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the gene CARD9, which encodes a signaling protein that is found downstream of many C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). CLRs encompass a large family of innate recognition receptors, expressed predominantly by myeloid and epithelial cells, which bind fungal carbohydrates and initiate antifungal immune responses. Accordingly, human CARD9 deficiency is associated with the spontaneous development of persistent and severe fungal infections that primarily localize to the skin and subcutaneous tissue, mucosal surfaces and/or central nervous system (CNS). In the last 3 years, more than 15 missense and nonsense CARD9 mutations have been reported which associate with the development of a wide spectrum of fungal infections caused by a variety of fungal organisms. The mechanisms by which CARD9 provides organ-specific protection against these fungal infections are now emerging. In this review, we summarize recent immunological and clinical advances that have provided significant mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of human CARD9 deficiency. We also discuss how genetic mutations in CARD9-coupled receptors (Dectin-1, Dectin-2) and CARD9-binding partners (MALT1, BCL10) affect human antifungal immunity relative to CARD9 deficiency, and we highlight major understudied research questions which merit future investigation. 	2016	11	11	Front Cell Infect Microbiol	Drummond	Rebecca A

27113748	10.15252/embr.201642109	The paracaspase MALT1 mediates CARD14-induced signaling in keratinocytes.	Mutations in CARD14 have recently been linked to psoriasis susceptibility. CARD14 is an epidermal regulator of NF-κB activation. However, the ability of CARD14 to activate other signaling pathways as well as the biochemical mechanisms that mediate and regulate its function remain to be determined. Here, we report that in addition to NF-κB signaling, CARD14 activates p38 and JNK MAP kinase pathways, all of which are dependent on the paracaspase MALT1. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CARD14 physically interacts with paracaspase MALT1 and activates MALT1 proteolytic activity and inflammatory gene expression, which are enhanced by psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations. Moreover, we show that MALT1 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 catalytic activity inhibits pathogenic mutant CARD14-induced cytokine and chemokine expression in human primary keratinocytes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a novel role for MALT1 in CARD14-induced signaling and indicate MALT1 as a valuable therapeutic target in psoriasis.	2017	08	15	EMBO Rep	Afonina	Inna S
27135977	10.1097/MOH.0000000000000257	Role of the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 complex in lymphoid malignancies.	The CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complex is a multimeric signaling complex controlling several important aspects of lymphocyte activation. Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding CBM proteins or their upstream regulators are associated with lymphoid malignancies, whereas loss-of-function mutations lead to immunodeficiency. This review reports on recent findings advancing our understanding of how CBM proteins contribute to malignant and nonmalignant hematological diseases in humans. Somatic gain-of-function mutations of CARMA1 (also known as CARD11), originally described for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, have recently been identified in patients with acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or Sézary syndrome, and in patients with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder known as BENTA. Loss-of-function mutations of CARMA1 and MALT1, on the other hand, have been reported to underlie human immunodeficiency. Lately, it has become clear that CBM-dependent signaling promotes lymphomagenesis not only via NF-κB activation, but also via the AP-1 family of transcription factors. The identification of new substrates of the protease MALT1 and the characterization of mice expressing catalytically inactive MALT1 have deepened our understanding of how the CBM complex controls lymphocyte proliferation through promoting MALT1's protease activity. The discovery of CARMA1 gain-of-function mutations in T-cell malignancies and BENTA patients, as well as the association of CARMA1 and MALT1 mutations with human immunodeficiency highlight the importance of CBM proteins in the regulation of lymphocyte functions, and suggest that the protease activity of MALT1 might be targeted to treat specific lymphoid malignancies.	2017	10	19	Curr Opin Hematol	Juilland	Mélanie
27452667	10.1016/j.semcancer.2016.07.003	MALT lymphoma: A paradigm of NF-κB dysregulation.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) invariably arises from a background of chronic microbial infection and/or autoimmune disorder at diverse mucosal sites. The prolonged chronic infection and/or autoimmunity generate active immune and inflammatory responses that provide a setting for evolution and development of autoreactive B-cells, their expansion and eventual malignant transformation following acquisition of genetic changes. The immune responses also play a critical role in sustaining the growth and survival of the transformed cells as shown by complete regression of a high proportion of MALT lymphoma of the stomach, ocular adnexa and skin following anti-microbial treatment. B-cell receptor engagement by auto-antigen as well as T-cell help including both cognate interaction and bystander help via soluble ligands such as CD40L and BAFF are thought to underpin the immunological drive in the lymphoma development through activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway respectively. Similarly, the three MALT lymphoma associated chromosome translocations, namely t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1,and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/BIRC3 (API2)-MALT1, are also capable of activating both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Furthermore, TNFAIP3 (A20) inactivation by deletion and/or mutation abolishes the auto-negative feedback to several signalling including BCR and TLR, which connect to the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Thus, there is a considerable overlap in the molecular pathways dysregulated by immunological drive and somatic genetic changes, strongly arguing for their oncogenic cooperation in the development of MALT lymphoma.	2017	12	18	Semin Cancer Biol	Du	Ming-Qing
27509941		E1/E2 of Hepatitis C Virus Genotype4 and Apoptosis.	Several studies have addressed the possible role of hepatitis C virus genotype4 (HCV GT4) in apoptosis. However, this still not fully understood. In the current study a reconstructed clone of E1/E2 polyprotein region of the HCV GT4 was transfected into the Huh7 cell line and a human apoptotic PCR array of 84 genes was used to investigate its possible significance for apoptosis. Out of the 84 genes, only 35 showed significant differential expression, 12 genes being upregulated and 23 downregulated. The highestup regulated genes were APAF1 (apoptotic peptidaseactivating factor 1), BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) and BCL 10 (Bcell CLL/ lymphoma protein 10) with fold regulation of 33.2, 30.1 and 18.9, respectively. The most downregulated were FAS (TNF receptor super family), TNFRSF10B (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10b) and FADD (FASassociated death domain) with fold regulation of 30.2, 27.7 and 14.9, respectively. These results suggest that the E1/E2 proteins may be involved in HCVinduced pathogenesis by modulating apoptosis through the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and disruption of the BCL2 gene family. 	2017	01	25	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	Zekri	AbdelRahman N

The pathogenesis of ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue-type (OAML) is still poorly understood. We analyzed 63 cases of such lymphomas for non-synonymous mutations in 24 candidate genes by amplicon sequencing. We validated frequent mutations in the NF-κB regulators MYD88, TNFAIP3 and TNIP1 in OAML, but also identified recurrent mutations in several additional components of the NF-κB pathway, including BCL10 and NFKBIA. Overall, 60% of cases had mutations in at least one component of NF-κB signaling, pointing to a central role of its genetic deregulation in OAML pathogenesis. Mutations in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 were each found in 8% of cases, indicating a pathogenetic function of these factors in OAML. KMT2D was identified as the first epigenetic regulator with mutations in OAML, being mutated in 22% of cases. Mutations in MYD88 were associated with an inferior disease-free survival. Overall, we identified here highly recurrent genetic lesions in components of the NF-κB pathway, of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 as well as KMT2D in OAML and thereby provide major novel insights into the pathogenesis of this B cell malignancy.	2018	03	26	Oncotarget	Johansson	Patricia
27681433	10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.080	MALT1 Protease Activation Triggers Acute Disruption of Endothelial Barrier Integrity via CYLD Cleavage.	Microvascular endothelial cells maintain a tight barrier to prevent passage of plasma and circulating immune cells into the extravascular tissue compartment, yet endothelial cells respond rapidly to vasoactive substances, including thrombin, allowing transient paracellular permeability. This response is a cornerstone of acute inflammation, but the mechanisms responsible are still incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that thrombin triggers MALT1 to proteolytically cleave cylindromatosis (CYLD). Fragmentation of CYLD results in microtubule disruption and a cascade of events leading to endothelial cell retraction and an acute permeability response. This finding reveals an unexpected role for the MALT1 protease, which previously has been viewed mostly as a driver of pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling in lymphocytes. Thus, MALT1 not only promotes immune cell activation but also acutely regulates endothelial cell biology, actions that together facilitate tissue inflammation. Pharmacologic inhibition of MALT1 may therefore have synergistic impact by targeting multiple disparate steps in the overall inflammatory response.	2017	11	13	Cell Rep	Klei	Linda R
27777308	10.1074/jbc.M116.754028	Molecular Determinants of Scaffold-induced Linear Ubiquitinylation of B Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia 10 (Bcl10) during T Cell Receptor and Oncogenic Caspase Recruitment Domain-containing Protein 11 (CARD11) Signaling.	The activation of NF-κB downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement is a key signaling step required for normal lymphocyte function during the adaptive immune response. During TCR signaling, the adaptor protein Bcl10 is inducibly recruited to the CARD11 scaffold protein as part of a multicomponent complex that induces IκB kinase (IKK) activity and NF-κB activation. Here, we show that a consequence of this recruitment is the TCR-induced conjugation of Bcl10 with linear-linked polyubiquitin chains to generate the signaling intermediate Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10, which is required for the association of Bcl10 with the NEMO subunit of the IKK complex. The TCR-induced generation of Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10 requires Bcl10 lysines 17, 31, and 63, CARD11, MALT1, and the HOIP subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) but not the HOIP accessory protein SHARPIN. CARD11 promotes signal-induced Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10 generation by co-recruiting Bcl10 with HOIP, thereby bringing substrate to enzyme. The CARD11-HOIP interaction is rendered TCR-inducible by the four autoinhibitory repressive elements in the CARD11 inhibitory domain and involves the CARD11 coiled-coil domain and two independent regions of HOIP. Interestingly, oncogenic CARD11 variants associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma spontaneously induce Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10 production to extents that correlate with their abilities to activate NF-κB and with their enhanced abilities to bind HOIP and Bcl10. Our results define molecular determinants that control the production of Lin(Ub)<sub>n</sub>-Bcl10, an important signaling intermediate in TCR and oncogenic CARD11 signaling.	2017	05	26	J Biol Chem	Yang	Yong-Kang
24681956	10.1038/onc.2014.43	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 promotes oral cancer progression through STAT1/ATF4/S100P signaling pathway.	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) is an apoptotic regulatory protein related to advanced TNM stage and disease recurrence in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the regulatory mechanism of BCL10 in OSCC progression is still unknown. Here, we showed that knockdown of endogenous BCL10 could significantly reduce cell migration and invasion abilities, retard cell proliferation by G0/G1 phase accumulation and inhibit tumorigenicity in vivo. In molecular level, we identified S100P as a crucial downstream effector of BCL10-inhibited OSCC progression by high-throughput microarray analysis. S100P messenger RNA and protein expression levels were significantly diminished in silenced-BCL10 clones, and transfected S100P expression plasmids restored migration, invasion, proliferation abilities and tumorigenicity in shBCL10 transfectants. Furthermore, we provided evidence that BCL10 regulated S100P expression through signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of BCL10 decreased S100P promoter activity, but showed no effect in truncated STAT1/ATF4 S100P promoter.  In addition, we also found that the P50/P65 signaling pathway was involved in BCL10-enhanced OSCC progression. Restored S100P in silenced-BCL10 clones could markedly reverse P65 activation via outside-in signaling. Taken together, we discovered a novel axis of BCL10-regulated OSCC progression via STAT1/ATF4/S100P/P65 signaling, which could predict the prognosis of OSCC and will be beneficial for developing therapeutic strategy against advanced OSCC. 	2015	06	10	Oncogene	Wu	T-S
25391967	10.1007/s11060-014-1655-3	Differential expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system.	Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS DLBCL) is a distinct and aggressive lymphoma that is confined to CNS. Since, central nervous system is barrier-protected and immunologically silent; role of TLR/BCR signaling in pathogenesis and biology of CNS DLBCL is intriguing. Genomic mutations in key regulators of TLR/BCR signaling pathway (MYD88/CD79B/CARD11) have recently been reported in this disease. These observations raised possible implications in novel targeted therapies; however, expression pattern of molecules related to TLR/BCR pathways in this lymphoma remains unknown. We have analyzed the expression of 19 genes encoding TLR/BCR pathways and targets in CNS DLBCLs (n = 20) by Nanostring nCounter™ analysis and compared it with expression patterns in purified reactive B-lymphocytes and systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n = 20). Relative expression of TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, CD79B and BLNK was higher in CNS DLBCLs than in control B-lymphocytes; where as TLR7, MALT1, BCL10, CD79A and LYN was lower in CNS DLBCLs (P &lt; 0.0001). When compared with systemic DLBCL samples, higher expression of TLR9, CD79B, CARD11, LYN and BLNK was noted in CNS DLBCL (&gt;1.5 fold change; P &lt; 0.01). The B cell receptor molecules like BLNK and CD79B were also associated with higher expression of MYD88 dependent TLRs (TLR4/5/9). In conclusion, we have shown over expression of TLR/BCR related genes or their targets, where genomic mutations have commonly been identified in CNS DLBCL. We have also demonstrated that TLR over expression closely relate with up regulation of genes associated with BCR pathway like CD79B/BLNK and CARD11, which play an important role in NF-kB pathway activation. Our results provide an important insight into the possibility of TLR and/or B-cell receptor signaling molecules as possible therapeutic targets in CNS DLBCL.	2015	10	26	J Neurooncol	Akhter	Ariz
25556945	10.1016/j.chembiol.2014.10.021	Activity-based probes for detection of active MALT1 paracaspase in immune cells and lymphomas.	MALT1 paracaspase is activated upon antigen receptor stimulation to promote lymphocyte activation. In addition, deregulated MALT1 protease activity drives survival of distinct lymphomas such as the activated B cell type of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). Here, we designed fluorophore or biotin-coupled activity based-probes (ABP) that covalently modify the active center of MALT1. MALT1-ABPs are exclusively labeling an active modified full length form of MALT1 upon T cell stimulation. Further, despite the CARMA1 requirement for initial MALT1 activation, the MALT1-ABPs show that protease activity is not confined to the high-molecular CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. Using biotin-coupled ABPs, we developed a robust assay for sensitive and selective detection of active MALT1 in cell lines, primary lymphocytes, and DLBCL tumor biopsies. Taken together, MALT1-ABPs represent powerful chemical tools to measure cellular MALT1 activation, determine efficacy of small molecule inhibitors, and classify lymphomas based on MALT1 activity status.	2015	09	29	Chem Biol	Eitelhuber	Andrea C
25569716	10.1038/ncomms6908	Conversion of the LIMA1 tumour suppressor into an oncogenic LMO-like protein by API2-MALT1 in MALT lymphoma.	MALT1 is the only known paracaspase and is a critical mediator of B- and T-cell receptor signalling. The function of the MALT1 gene is subverted by oncogenic chimeric fusions arising from the recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21) aberration, which is the most frequent translocation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. API2-MALT1-positive MALT lymphomas manifest antibiotic resistance and aggressive clinical behaviour with poor clinical outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying API2-MALT1-induced MALT lymphomagenesis are not fully understood. Here we show that API2-MALT1 induces paracaspase-mediated cleavage of the tumour suppressor protein LIMA1. LIMA1 binding by API2-MALT1 is API2 dependent and proteolytic cleavage is dependent on MALT1 paracaspase activity. Intriguingly, API2-MALT1-mediated proteolysis generates a LIM domain-only (LMO)-containing fragment with oncogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, primary MALT lymphomas harbouring the API2-MALT1 fusion uniquely demonstrate LIMA1 cleavage fragments. Our studies reveal a novel paracaspase-mediated oncogenic gain-of-function mechanism in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma. 	2015	12	08	Nat Commun	Nie	Zilin
25736751	10.1007/978-1-4939-2422-6_12	Visualizing TCR-induced POLKADOTS formation and NF-κB activation in the D10 T-cell clone and mouse primary effector T cells.	T cells are an immune cell lineage that play a central role in protection against pathogen infection. Antigen, in the form of pathogen-derived peptides, stimulates the T-cell receptor (TCR), leading to activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The subsequent NF-κB-dependent gene expression program drives expansion and effector differentiation of antigen-specific T cells, leading to the adaptive anti-pathogen immune response. The cell surface TCR transmits activating signals to cytosolic NF-κB by a complex signaling cascade, in which the adapter protein Bcl10 plays a key role. We have previously demonstrated that TCR engagement leads to the formation of cytosolic Bcl10 clusters, called POLKADOTS, that provide a platform for the assembly of the terminal signaling complex that ultimately mediates NF-κB activation. In this chapter, we describe the methods utilized to visualize the formation of TCR-induced POLKADOTS and to study the temporal association between POLKADOTS formation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit, RelA/p65. 	2015	11	20	Methods Mol Biol	Paul	Suman
25748427	10.1371/journal.pone.0119363	MALT1-ubiquitination triggers non-genomic NF-κB/IKK signaling upon platelet activation.	We have recently shown that IKK complex plays an important non-genomic role in platelet function, i.e., regulates SNARE machinery-dependent membrane fusion. In this connection, it is well known that MALT1, whose activity is modulated by proteasome, plays an important role in the regulation of IKK complex. Therefore, the present studies investigated the mechanism by which IKK signaling is regulated in the context of the platelet proteasome. It was found that platelets express a functional proteasome, and form CARMA/MALT1/Bcl10 (CBM) complex when activated. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, the proteasome was found to regulate platelet function (aggregation, integrin activation, secretion, phosphatidylserine exposure and changes in intracellular calcium). It was also found to regulate thrombogenesis and physiologic hemostasis. We also observed, upon platelet activation, that MALT1 is ubiquitinated, and this coincides with the activation of the IKK/NF-κB-signaling pathway. Finally, we observed that the proteasome inhibitor blocks CBM complex formation and the interaction of IKKγ and MALT1; abrogates SNARE formation, and the association of MALT1 with TAK1 and TAB2, which are upstream of the CBM complex. Thus, our data demonstrate that MALT1 ubiquitination is critical for the engagement of CBM and IKK complexes, thereby directing platelet signals to the NF-κB pathway. 	2016	01	14	PLoS One	Karim	Zubair A
25849213	10.1371/journal.pone.0122365	Functional characterization of zebrafish (Danio rerio) Bcl10.	The complexes formed by BCL10, MALT1 and specific members of the family of CARMA proteins (CBM complex), have recently focused much attention because they represent a central hub regulating activation of the transcription factor NF-κB following various cellular stimulations. In this manuscript, we report the functional characterization of a Danio rerio 241 amino acids polypeptide ortholog of the Caspase recruiting domain (CARD)-containing protein BCL10. Biochemical studies show that zebrafish Bcl10 (zBcl10) dimerizes and binds to components of the CBM complex. Fluorescence microscopy observations demonstrate that zBcl10 forms cytoplasmic filaments similar to that formed by human BCL10 (hBCL10). Functionally, in human cells zBcl10 is more effective in activating NF-κB compared to hBCL10, possibly due to the lack of carboxy-terminal inhibitory serine residues present in the human protein. Also, depletion experiments carried out through expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting hBCL10 indicate that zBcl10 can functionally replace the human protein. Finally, we show that the zebrafish cell line PAC2 is suitable to carry out reporter assays for monitoring the activation state of NF- kB transcription factor. In conclusion, this work shows that zebrafish may excellently serve as a model organism to study complex and intricate signal transduction pathways, such as those that control NF-κB activation. 	2016	03	31	PLoS One	Mazzone	Pellegrino
25956014	10.1016/j.jaci.2015.02.037	Advances in basic and clinical immunology in 2014.	Genetic identification of immunodeficiency syndromes has become more efficient with the availability of whole-exome sequencing, expediting the identification of relevant genes and complementing traditional linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping. New genes defects causing immunodeficiency include phophoglucomutase 3 (PGM3), cytidine 5' triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1), nuclear factor κB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), phosphoinositide-3 kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), IL21, and Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1). New case reports expanded the clinical spectrum of gene defects. For example, a specific recombination-activating gene 1 variant protein with partial recombinant activity might produce Omenn syndrome or a common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. Central and peripheral B-cell tolerance was investigated in patients with several primary immunodeficiencies, including common variable immunodeficiency and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, to explain the occurrence of autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders. The role of IL-12 and IL-15 in the enhancement of natural killer cell activity was reported. Newborn screening for T-cell deficiency is being implemented in more states and is achieving its goal of defining the true incidence of severe combined immunodeficiency and providing early treatment that offers the highest survival for these patients. Definitive treatment of severe immunodeficiency with both hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy was reported to be successful, with increasing definition of conditions needed for optimal outcomes. Progress in HIV infection is directed toward the development of an effective vaccine and the eradication of hidden latent virus reservoirs. 	2015	07	23	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Chinen	Javier
25965667	10.1371/journal.pone.0127083	MALT1 Protease Activity Is Required for Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses.	CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 signalosomes play important roles in antigen receptor signaling and other pathways. Previous studies have suggested that as part of this complex, MALT1 functions as both a scaffolding protein to activate NF-κB through recruitment of ubiquitin ligases, and as a protease to cleave and inactivate downstream inhibitory signaling proteins. However, our understanding of the relative importance of these two distinct MALT1 activities has been hampered by a lack of selective MALT1 protease inhibitors with suitable pharmacologic properties. To fully investigate the role of MALT1 protease activity, we generated mice homozygous for a protease-dead mutation in MALT1. We found that some, but not all, MALT1 functions in immune cells were dependent upon its protease activity. Protease-dead mice had defects in the generation of splenic marginal zone and peritoneal B1 B cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed decreased T cell receptor-stimulated proliferation and IL-2 production while B cell receptor-stimulated proliferation was partially dependent on protease activity. In dendritic cells, stimulation of cytokine production through the Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle C-type lectin receptors was also found to be partially dependent upon protease activity. In vivo, protease-dead mice had reduced basal immunoglobulin levels, and showed defective responses to immunization with T-dependent and T-independent antigens. Surprisingly, despite these decreased responses, MALT1 protease-dead mice, but not MALT1 null mice, developed mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in multiple organs, suggesting MALT1 protease activity plays a role in immune homeostasis. These findings highlight the importance of MALT1 protease activity in multiple immune cell types, and in integrating immune responses in vivo. 	2016	02	19	PLoS One	Yu	Jong W
25973362	10.1016/j.fob.2015.04.011	Oligomerized CARD16 promotes caspase-1 assembly and IL-1β processing.	Increasing evidence indicates that caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-mediated caspase-1 (CASP1) assembly is an essential process for its activation and subsequent interleukin (IL)-1β release, leading to the initiation of inflammation. Both CARD16 and CARD17 were previously reported as inhibitory homologs of CASP1; however, their molecular function remains unclear. Here, we identified that oligomerization activity allows CARD16 to function as a CASP1 activator. We investigated the molecular characteristics of CARD16 and CARD17 in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Although both CARD16 and CARD17 interacted with CASP1CARD, only CARD16 formed a homo-oligomer. Oligomerized CARD16 formed a filament-like structure with CASP1CARD and a speck with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD. A filament-like structure formed by CARD16 promoted CASP1 filament assembly and IL-1β release. In contrast, CARD17 did not form a homo-oligomer or filaments and inhibited CASP1-dependent IL-1β release. Mutated CARD16D27G, mimicking the CARD17 amino acid sequence, formed a homo-oligomer but failed to form a filament-like structure. Consequently, CARD16D27G weakly promoted CASP1 filament assembly and subsequent IL-1β release. These results suggest that oligomerized CARD16 promotes CARD-mediated molecular assembly and CASP1 activation. 	2015	05	14	FEBS Open Bio	Karasawa	Tadayoshi
26038114	10.15252/msb.20145880	Systems-wide analysis of BCR signalosomes and downstream phosphorylation and ubiquitylation.	B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for the development and function of B cells; however, the spectrum of proteins involved in BCR signaling is not fully known. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to monitor the dynamics of BCR signaling complexes (signalosomes) and to investigate the dynamics of downstream phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling. We identify most of the previously known components of BCR signaling, as well as many proteins that have not yet been implicated in this system. BCR activation leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of the receptor-proximal signaling components, many of which are co-regulated by both the modifications. We illustrate the power of multilayered proteomic analyses for discovering novel BCR signaling components by demonstrating that BCR-induced phosphorylation of RAB7A at S72 prevents its association with effector proteins and with endo-lysosomal compartments. In addition, we show that BCL10 is modified by LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitylation, and demonstrate an important function of LUBAC in BCR-induced NF-κB signaling. Our results offer a global and integrated view of BCR signaling, and the provided datasets can serve as a valuable resource for further understanding BCR signaling networks. 	2016	03	01	Mol Syst Biol	Satpathy	Shankha
26202083	10.3892/ijmm.2015.2290	Bcl10 crucially nucleates the pro-apoptotic complexes comprising PDK1, PKCζ and caspase-3 at the nuclear envelope of etoposide-treated human cervical carcinoma C4-I cells.	Protein kinase (PK)Cζ signaling at various subcellular levels affects cell survival, differentiation, growth and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanisms modulating PKCζ activity at the nuclear membrane (NM) are not yet fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that PKCζ interacts with the B‑cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) protein at the NM of human cervical carcinoma (HCC) C4‑I cells. In the present study, we aimed to further clarify the interactions between PKCζ, Bcl10 and other proteins co-immunoprecipitated from NMs isolated from untreated and etoposide (also known as VP‑16; 2.0 µg/ml)‑treated C4‑I cells using biochemical and proteomics analyses. Aside from the Bcl10 protein, 3‑phosphoinositide‑dependent protein kinase‑1 (PDK1) also co-immunoprecipitated with PKCζ from NMs of C4‑I cells, indicating the assembly of a heterotrimeric complex, which increased with time in VP‑16‑exposed cells, as did the activity of PDK1‑phosphorylated‑PKCζ. In turn, PKCζ‑phosphorylated‑Bcl10 straddled an enlarged complex which comprised caspase‑3. Subsequently, activity‑enhanced caspase‑3 cleaved and inactivated PKCζ. Finally, the suppression of Bcl10 using specific siRNA or lentiviral transduction prevented the increase in the PDK1•PKCζ association, the increase in the activity of PKCζ and caspase‑3, as well as the caspase‑3‑mediated PKCζ proteolysis and inactivation from occurring at the NMs of the VP‑16‑exposed C4‑I cells. Our observations provide evidence that Bcl10 acts as a pivotal pro-apoptotic protein which crucially nucleates complexes comprising PDK1, PKCζ and active caspase‑3 at the NMs of VP‑16‑exposed C4‑I cells. Hence, our data suggest that Bcl10 and PKCζ are potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of HCC.	2016	05	09	Int J Mol Med	Chiarini	Anna
26277595	10.1016/j.jaci.2015.06.031	Genetic errors of the human caspase recruitment domain-B-cell lymphoma 10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma-translocation gene 1 (CBM) complex: Molecular, immunologic, and clinical heterogeneity.	Three members of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of adaptors (CARD9, CARD10, and CARD11) are known to form heterotrimers with B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma-translocation gene 1 (MALT1). These 3 CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complexes activate nuclear factor κB in both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity. Human inherited defects of the 3 components of the CBM complex, including the 2 adaptors CARD9 and CARD11 and the 2 core components BCL10 and MALT1, have recently been reported. Biallelic loss-of-function mutant alleles underlie several different immunologic and clinical phenotypes, which can be assigned to 2 distinct categories. Isolated invasive fungal infections of unclear cellular basis are associated with CARD9 deficiency, whereas a broad range of clinical manifestations, including those characteristic of T- and B-lymphocyte defects, are associated with CARD11, MALT1, and BCL10 deficiencies. Interestingly, human subjects with these mutations have some features in common with the corresponding knockout mice, but other features are different between human subjects and mice. Moreover, germline and somatic gain-of-function mutations of MALT1, BCL10, and CARD11 have also been found in patients with other lymphoproliferative disorders. This broad range of germline and somatic CBM lesions, including loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations, highlights the contribution of each of the components of the CBM complex to human immunity. 	2016	02	29	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Pérez de Diego	Rebeca

26525107	10.1038/ncomms9777	The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves HOIL1 reducing linear ubiquitination by LUBAC to dampen lymphocyte NF-κB signalling.	Antigen receptor signalling activates the canonical NF-κB pathway via the CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome involving key, yet ill-defined roles for linear ubiquitination. The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves and removes negative checkpoint proteins, amplifying lymphocyte responses in NF-κB activation and in B-cell lymphoma subtypes. To identify new human MALT1 substrates, we compare B cells from the only known living MALT1(mut/mut) patient with healthy MALT1(+/mut) family members using 10-plex Tandem Mass Tag TAILS N-terminal peptide proteomics. We identify HOIL1 of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex as a novel MALT1 substrate. We show linear ubiquitination at B-cell receptor microclusters and signalosomes. Late in the NF-κB activation cycle HOIL1 cleavage transiently reduces linear ubiquitination, including of NEMO and RIP1, dampening NF-κB activation and preventing reactivation. By regulating linear ubiquitination, MALT1 is both a positive and negative pleiotropic regulator of the human canonical NF-κB pathway-first promoting activation via the CBM--then triggering HOIL1-dependent negative-feedback termination, preventing reactivation.	2016	05	10	Nat Commun	Klein	Theo
26615705	10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2015.10.001	Antisecretory medication is associated with decreased Helicobacter pylori detection in gastric marginal zone lymphoma.	Helicobacter pylori status influences the prognosis and management of gastric extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma), so accurate determination of H pylori status is of clinical importance. The low rate of histologic H pylori positivity among gastric MALT lymphoma cases at our institution prompted investigation for possible causes. A case series of 24 patients as having gastric MALT lymphoma (with no diffuse large B-cell component) in a tertiary care setting between 1997 and 2010 was identified, and clinical records were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for H pylori and BCL10 was performed. This study received institutional review board approval (protocol number M13-033). Thirty-nine percent of cases (9/23) were H pylori positive by histology, and 4 additional patients had positive serologic results; overall, 57% of cases (13/23) were positive for H pylori. Treatment with antisecretory medications was associated with a lower likelihood of histologic positivity (13% among treated patients vs 75% among untreated; P = .04). Nuclear localization of BCL10 was seen in 2 cases and was not associated with H pylori status. Antisecretory medications decrease the likelihood of histologic detection of H pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma cases. Incorporation of results of serologic or other testing is needed to ensure correct classification with respect to H pylori status.	2016	09	15	Ann Diagn Pathol	Schaberg	Kurt B
26668357	10.1073/pnas.1507459112	Lymphomagenic CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 signaling drives malignant B-cell proliferation via cooperative NF-κB and JNK activation.	The aggressive activated B cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is characterized by aberrant B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and constitutive nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activation, which is required for tumor cell survival. BCR-induced NF-κB activation requires caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11), and CARD11 gain-of-function mutations are recurrently detected in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To investigate the consequences of dysregulated CARD11 signaling in vivo, we generated mice that conditionally express the human DLBCL-derived CARD11(L225LI) mutant. Surprisingly, CARD11(L225LI) was sufficient to trigger aggressive B-cell lymphoproliferation, leading to early postnatal lethality. CARD11(L225LI) constitutively associated with B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) to simultaneously activate the NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascades. Genetic deficiencies of either BCL10 or MALT1 completely rescued the phenotype, and pharmacological inhibition of JNK was, similar to NF-κB blockage, toxic to autonomously proliferating CARD11(L225LI)-expressing B cells. Moreover, constitutive JNK activity was observed in primary human activated B cell-like (ABC)-DLBCL specimens, and human ABC-DLBCL cells were also sensitive to JNK inhibitors. Thus, our results demonstrate that enforced activation of CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 signaling is sufficient to drive transformed B-cell expansion in vivo and identify the JNK pathway as a therapeutic target for ABC-DLBCL. 	2016	08	11	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Knies	Nathalie
26711259	10.1128/MCB.00876-15	Negative Regulation of CARD11 Signaling and Lymphoma Cell Survival by the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF181.	NF-κB activation downstream of antigen receptor engagement is a highly regulated event required for lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. The pathway is often dysregulated in lymphoma, leading to constitutive NF-κB activity that supports the aberrant proliferation of transformed lymphocytes. To identify novel regulators of antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, we developed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based interaction cloning (BRIC), a screening strategy that can detect protein-protein interactions in live mammalian cells in a high-throughput manner. Using this strategy, we identified the RING finger protein RNF181 as an interactor of CARD11, a key signaling scaffold in the antigen receptor pathway. We present evidence that RNF181 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to inhibit antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB downstream of CARD11. The levels of the obligate signaling protein Bcl10 are reduced by RNF181 even prior to signaling, and Bcl10 can serve as a substrate for RNF181 E3 ligase activity in vitro. Furthermore, RNF181 limits the proliferation of human diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells that depend upon aberrant CARD11 signaling to NF-κB for growth and survival in culture. Our results define a new regulatory checkpoint that can modulate the output of CARD11 signaling to NF-κB in both normal and transformed lymphocytes. 	2016	07	06	Mol Cell Biol	Pedersen	Sarah M
23846624	10.14670/HH-29.77	BCL10 expression and localization in ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas: a comparative cytogenetic and immunohistochemical study.	T(1;14) (p22;q32) involving BCL10 and IGH genes is a rare but recurrent chromosomal aberration in MALT-type lymphoma. It is rarely described in ocular adnexa B cell lymphomas, although nuclear BCL10 shuttling seems to be critical for disease progression in this district. We have evaluated the translocations MALT lymphoma-related in a series of 45 ocular adnexa cases, focusing in particular on their relation with BCL10 expression and its cellular topographic distribution. A prognostic tissue microarray (TMA) with ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas was designed. A study of BCL10 expression and its topographic distribution was performed through immunohistochemistry. In addition the assessment of t(14;18) (q32;q21), t(1;14) (p22;q32) and t(11;18) (q21;q21) was determined by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH). Our series revealed t(14;18) (q32;q21) in 6/43 cases (14,3%). t(1;14) (p22;q32), never described in ocular adnexa MALT lymphomas, was observed in 3/31 (9,7%), two of which exhibited the gain of 3' upstream BCL10 gene signal (4%), whereas no case showed t(11;18) (q21;q21). Moreover, BCL10 expression was observed in 18/45 cases. In particular its nuclear expression was revealed in 12/45 cases, cytoplasmic expression in 5/45 and both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in 1/45. Statistical analysis demonstrated that while BCL10 cytoplasmic expression is significantly related to the presence of the investigated chromosomal aberrations, in particular with t(14;18) (q32;q21), BCL10 nuclear shuttling does not show any correlation with these translocations. Our data support that BCL10 nuclear distribution is neither related to BCL10 rearrangement nor to other known translocations.	2014	08	28	Histol Histopathol	Cerrone	Margherita
23886693	10.1016/j.imbio.2013.06.013	Activation of NF-κB and respiratory burst following Aspergillus fumigatus stimulation of macrophages.	Dectin-2, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR), plays an essential role in mediating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and anti-fungal immunity in response to Candida albicans infection. However, the molecular mechanisms and function of Dectin-2 signaling in response to infection by the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus have not been characterized. In order to characterize Dectin-2 signaling in response to A. fumigatus infection, activation of Dectin-2 was analyzed at both transcriptional and translational levels. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation, NF-κB activation and cytokine production downstream of Dectin-2 activation were also investigated. In addition, Dectin-2-Syk function and its ability to mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination of A. fumigatus conidia was examined. We demonstrate that Syk is involved in Dectin-2-induced IκBα (inhibitor of kappa B protein) phosphorylation and NF-κB activation following A. fumigatus stimulation in a time dependent manner. Silencing of Dectin-2 and Syk as well as Syk inhibition blocks NF-κB activation and cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the killing of A. fumigatus conidia and ROS production are significantly affected by Dectin-2 or Syk silencing as well as Syk inhibition. Swelling and germination of the fungus followed by hyphae formation and not the resting and heat-inactivated form of A. fumigatus mediate the activation of Dectin-2 signaling. In conclusion, Syk plays an essential role in IκBα kinase phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and ROS production mediated by Dectin-2 activation in response to A. fumigatus infection. 	2014	07	25	Immunobiology	Sun	He
24329526	10.1089/dna.2013.2199	The TCR γδ repertoire and relative gene expression characteristics of T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells.	Despite significant improvement in our understanding of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) biology and pathogenesis, many questions remain unanswered. In previous studies, we found a T-ALL case with two malignant T-cell clones with Vδ1Dδ2Dδ3Jδ1 and Vδ2Dδ3Jδ2 rearrangements. In this study, we further characterized T-ALL cases with two malignant clones containing Vδ1Dδ3Jδ1 and Vδ2Dδ1Jδ1 rearrangements using fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), sequencing, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. We further analyzed the distribution and clonality of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vγ and Vδ subfamily T cells in the two T-ALL cases by RT-PCR and GeneScan. Monoclonal Vδ1 and Vδ2 subfamilies were confirmed in both samples, the Vδ3 through Vδ7 subfamilies could not be detected in the T-ALL samples, whereas the oligoclonal Vδ8 subfamily could be identified. Based on the clinical finding that both of the T-ALL cases with two malignant T-cell clones had a poor outcome, we attempted to compare the expression pattern of genes related to T-cell activation and proliferation between cases with the malignant Vδ1 and Vδ2 T-cell clones and T-ALL cases with a mono-malignant Vα T-cell clone. We selected two T-ALL cases with VαJα rearrangements and analyzed the expression level of Notch1, TAL1, and the CARMA-BCL10-MALT-A20-NF-κB pathway genes by real-time PCR. A20 had significantly higher expression in the biclonal compared with the monoclonal T-ALL group (p=0.0354), and there was a trend toward higher expression for the other genes in the biclonal group with the exception of TAL1, although the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we identified two T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant T-cell clones and described the characteristics of the biclonal T-ALL subtype and its gene expression pattern. Thus, our findings may improve the understanding of biclonal T-ALL. 	2014	03	03	DNA Cell Biol	Zheng	Haitao
24375035	10.1002/jcp.24543	The three CARMA sisters: so different, so similar: a portrait of the three CARMA proteins and their involvement in human disorders.	Initially identified by their ability to modulate the functional activity of BCL10, the three CARMA proteins, CARMA1, -2, and -3, have recently themselves taken a leading role on the stage of molecular medicine. Although considered for some time as simple ancillary proteins, increasingly accumulating recent data evidently indicate a role of primary importance for these three proteins in the pathophysiology of several human tumors and inflammatory disorders. In fact, recent scientific literature clearly establishes that CARMA1 is one of the most mutated genes in a subtype of B-cell lymphoma and, at the same time, responsible for some rare human immunodeficiency conditions. On the other hand, mutations in CARMA2 are responsible for the hereditary transmission of some inflammatory disorders of the skin, including familial psoriasis and ptiriasis; whereas expression of CARMA3 appears to be deregulated in different human tumors. Here we describe and summarize the mutations found in the genes coding for the three CARMA proteins in these different human pathological conditions, and offer an interpretation of the molecular mechanisms from which arise the biological outcomes in which these proteins are involved.	2014	07	21	J Cell Physiol	Scudiero	Ivan
24383645	10.1111/imm.12207	N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis in the mouse provides strong genetic and in vivo evidence for the role of the Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD) of CARD-MAGUK1 in T regulatory cell development.	Natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells generated in the thymus are essential throughout life for the maintenance of T-cell homeostasis and the prevention of autoimmunity. T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD28-mediated activation of nuclear factor-κB and (J)un (N)-terminal kinase pathways is known to play a key role in nTreg cell development but many of the predicted molecular interactions are based on extrapolations from non-Treg cell TCR stimulation with non-physiological ligands. For the first time, we provide strong genetic evidence of a scaffold function for the Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD) of the TCR signalling protein CARD-MAGUK1 (CARMA1) in nTreg cell development in vivo. We report two, new, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-derived mutant mice, Vulpo and Zerda, with a profound block in the development of nTreg cells in the thymus as well as impaired inducible Treg cell differentiation in the periphery. Despite independent heritage, both mutants harbour different point mutations in the CARD of the CARMA1 protein. Mutations in vulpo and zerda do not affect expression levels of CARMA1 but still impair signalling through the TCR due to defective downstream Bcl-10 recruitment by the mutated CARD of CARMA1. Phenotypic differences observed between Vulpo and Zerda mutants suggest a role for the CARD of CARMA1 independent of Bcl-10 activation of downstream pathways. We conclude that our forward genetic approach demonstrates a critical role for the CARD function of CARMA1 in Treg cell development in vivo.	2014	05	15	Immunology	Salisbury	Emma M
24411492	10.1016/j.cytogfr.2013.12.008	The CBM signalosome: potential therapeutic target for aggressive lymphoma?	The CBM signalosome plays a pivotal role in mediating antigen-receptor induced NF-κB signaling to regulate lymphocyte functions. The CBM complex forms filamentous structure and recruits downstream signaling components to activate NF-κB. MALT1, the protease component in the CBM complex, cleaves key proteins in the feedback loop of the NF-κB signaling pathway and enhances NF-κB activation. The aberrant activity of the CBM complex has been linked to aggressive lymphoma. Recent years have witnessed dramatic progresses in understanding the assembly mechanism of the CBM complex, and advances in the development of targeted therapy for aggressive lymphoma. Here, we will highlight these progresses and give an outlook on the potential translation of this knowledge from bench to bedside for aggressive lymphoma patients. 	2015	01	10	Cytokine Growth Factor Rev	Yang	Chenghua
24443940	10.1111/cei.12275	CARD11 blockade suppresses murine collagen-induced arthritis via inhibiting CARD11/Bcl10 assembly and T helper type 17 response.	The scaffold protein caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11) is implicated in the regulation of inflammation and autoimmunity. The present study aimed to explore the role of CARD11 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated with either CARD11-targeted interfering RNA (CARD11 siRNA) or control siRNA by intraperitoneal injection every 3 days after CIA establishment. The clinical score of arthritis was recorded every other day. Synovial inflammation and cartilage erosion were evaluated by histology and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Serum anti-type II collagen (anti-CII) antibodies and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The CARD11/Bcl10 formation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation was assessed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, and the percentage of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells was determined by flow cytometry. Systemic administration of CARD11 siRNA significantly reduced the clinical score of CIA severity. As indicated by the histology, joint inflammation and destruction were attenuated by CARD11 siRNA treatment. Micro-CT demonstrated less severe joint destruction in CARD11 siRNA-treated mice than in control mice. CARD11 siRNA treatment resulted in inhibition of CARD11/Bcl10 formation and the subsequent NF-κB activation. In addition, treatment with CARD11 siRNA resulted in a pronounced decrease in proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-17. Serum anti-CII antibody and the percentage of Th17 cells were also significantly reduced. CARD11 is involved in the pathogenesis of CIA by formation of the CARD11/Bcl10 complex and enhancement of the Th17 cell response. Targeting CARD11 provides a novel research direction in the development of therapeutic strategies for RA. 	2014	06	20	Clin Exp Immunol	Wang	H
24491438	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0915	Essential role of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex in lymphoma revealed by rare germline polymorphisms.	Constitutive activation of NF-κB is a hallmark of the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), owing to upstream signals from the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MYD88 pathways. The linear polyubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear polyubiquitin chains to IκB kinase-γ, a necessary event in some pathways that engage NF-κB. Two germline polymorphisms affecting the LUBAC subunit RNF31 are rare among healthy individuals (∼1%) but enriched in ABC DLBCL (7.8%). These polymorphisms alter RNF31 α-helices that mediate binding to the LUBAC subunit RBCK1, thereby increasing RNF31-RBCK1 association, LUBAC enzymatic activity, and NF-κB engagement. In the BCR pathway, LUBAC associates with the CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 adapter complex and is required for ABC DLBCL viability. A stapled RNF31 α-helical peptide based on the ABC DLBCL-associated Q622L polymorphism inhibited RNF31-RBCK1 binding, decreased NF-κB activation, and killed ABC DLBCL cells, credentialing this protein-protein interface as a therapeutic target. We provide genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence that the LUBAC ubiquitin ligase is a therapeutic target in ABC DLBCL, the DLBCL subtype that is most refractory to current therapy. More generally, our findings highlight the role of rare germline-encoded protein variants in cancer pathogenesis.	2014	11	24	Cancer Discov	Yang	Yibin
24497531	10.1182/blood-2013-05-504019	A catalytic-independent role for the LUBAC in NF-κB activation upon antigen receptor engagement and in lymphoma cells.	Antigen receptor-mediated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation relies on the formation of a large multi-protein complex that contains CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex). This signalosome is pirated in the activated B-cell-like subgroup of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL) to drive aberrant NF-κB activation, thereby promoting cell survival and propagation. Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we screened for additional components of the CBM in lymphocytes. We found that the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which was previously linked to cytokine-mediated NF-κB activation, dynamically integrates the CBM and marshals NF-κB optimal activation following antigen receptor ligation independently of its catalytic activity. The LUBAC also participates in preassembled CBM complex in cells derived from ABC DLBCL. Silencing the LUBAC reduced NF-κB activation and was toxic in ABC DLBCL cell lines. Thus, our findings reveal a role for the LUBAC during lymphocyte activation and in B-cell malignancy. 	2014	06	09	Blood	Dubois	Sonia M
24548923	10.1016/j.molimm.2014.01.011	Phosphorylation of Carma1, but not Bcl10, by Akt regulates TCR/CD28-mediated NF-κB induction and cytokine production.	Previous studies from our group and others have shown that the Akt kinase can contribute to induction of NF-κB by antigen receptor signaling. However, the direct targets of Akt in this pathway are not known. Here we show that Akt-mediated NF-κB activation is mediated at least in part through direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Carma1, which we previously demonstrated could interact with Akt in a TCR ligation-dependent manner. The putative Akt phosphorylation sites in Carma1 are distinct from known PKC consensus sites. Mutation of S551, S637 and S645 in Carma1 to non-phosphorylatable residues decreased phosphorylation of GST-Carma1-linker construct by Akt in vitro. In addition, Carma1 S637A/S645A mutants were significantly impaired in their ability to restore TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-2 expression in Carma1-deficient T cells. Thus, our data reveal Carma1 as a novel target for Akt phosphorylation and suggest that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Carma1 is an additional regulatory mechanism tuning the NF-κB response downstream of antigen receptor and co-stimulatory signaling.	2014	06	07	Mol Immunol	Cheng	Jing

24633921	10.1007/s13277-014-1791-6	CARMA3 is upregulated in human pancreatic carcinoma, and its depletion inhibits tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion.	Elevated CARMA3 expression has been reported to be involved in tumor progression of several cancer types. In the present study, we examined the expression pattern of CARMA3 protein and its biological roles in human pancreatic carcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry, we checked CARMA3 protein expression in 95 pancreatic ductal carcinoma specimens. We found that CARMA3 was overexpressed in 34 of 95 (35.8 %) specimens. A significant association was observed between CARMA3 overexpression with histological grade (p=0.0099) and nodal status (p=0.0126). To further explore its biological roles, we knocked down CARMA3 expression in CAPAN2 cell line using small interfering RNA (siRNA). MTT growth assay, wound healing assay, and Transwell assay showed that CARMA3 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We also showed that CARMA3 depletion inhibited EGF-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation and its target genes' expression. The effect of CARMA3 depletion on NF-κB signaling was significantly reduced in Bcl10-depleted cells. In conclusion, CARMA3 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and regulates malignant cell growth, invasion, and NF-κB signaling, which was dependent on its association with Bcl10.	2014	08	19	Tumour Biol	Du	Shiyu
24641824	10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.03.011	Degraded λ-carrageenan activates NF-κB and AP-1 pathways in macrophages and enhances LPS-induced TNF-α secretion through AP-1.	Carrageenan (CGN), a high molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide, is a traditional ingredient used in food industry. Its degraded forms have been identified as potential carcinogens, although the mechanism remains unclear. The effects of degraded λ-carrageenan (λ-dCGN) on murine RAW264.7 cells and human THP-1-derived macrophage cells were investigated by studying its actions on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, and activation of nuclear factor-κb (NF-κB) and activation protein-1 (AP-1) pathways. We found that λ-dCGN was much stronger than native λ-CGN in the activation of macrophages to secrete TNF-α. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with λ-dCGN resulted in the upregulation of TLR4, CD14 and MD-2 expressions, but it did not increase the binding of lipopolysacchride (LPS) with macrophages. Meanwhile, λ-dCGN treatment activated NF-κB via B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation. In addition, λ-dCGN induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases/1/2/mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2/MAPK) and AP-1 activation. Interestingly, pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with λ-dCGN markedly enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF-α secretion. This pretreatment resulted in the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and intensified activation of AP-1. λ-dCGN induced an inflammatory reaction via both NF-κB and AP-1, and enhanced the inflammatory effect of LPS through AP-1 activation. The study demonstrated the role of λ-dCGN to induce the inflammatory reaction and to aggravate the effect of LPS on macrophages, suggesting that λ-dCGN produced during food processing and gastric digestion may be a safety concern.	2014	08	18	Biochim Biophys Acta	Chen	Haimin
24702227	10.3109/00016489.2013.878474	Increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.	The increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs indicates that these pattern recognition receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. Changes in expression of pattern recognition receptors may be associated with immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. We therefore assessed the levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs associated with innate immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma specimens were collected from 23 patients diagnosed with acquired cholesteatoma from August 2010 to July 2012. The posterior auricular skin of each patient was used as control. The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA were assessed quantitatively using real-time RT-PCR and correlated with sex, hearing level, the presence of bacteria, and the need for repeat surgery. The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p &lt; 0.05 each). However, mRNA abundance was not associated with patient sex, hearing level, presence of bacteria or history of reoperation (p &gt; 0.05 each).	2014	12	28	Acta Otolaryngol	Kim	Myung Gu
24732096	10.4161/cc.28707	BCL10 regulates RNF8/RNF168-mediated ubiquitination in the DNA damage response.	Timely and proper cellular response to DNA damage is essential for maintenance of genome stability and integrity. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) facilitates ubiquitination of NEMO in the cytosol, activating NFκB signaling. Translocation and/or point mutations of BCL10 associate with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and other malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which the resulting aberrant expression of BCL10 leads to cellular oncogenesis are poorly understood. In this report, we found that BCL10 in the nucleus is enriched at the DNA damage sites in an ATM- and RNF8-dependent manner. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BCL10 promotes its interaction with and presentation of UBC13 to RNF8, and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination of BCL10 enhances binding of BCL10 and UBC13 to RNF168. This allows mono-ubiquitination on H2AX by RNF168 and further poly-ubiquitination by the RNF8/RNF168-containing complex. Depletion of BCL10 compromised homology recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair because of insufficient recruitment of BRCA1, RAD51, and the ubiquitinated DNA damage response factors. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel function of BCL10 in delivering UBC13 to RNF8/RNF168 to regulate ubiquitination-mediated DSB signaling and repair. 	2015	01	12	Cell Cycle	Zhao	Hongchang
24777530	10.1038/ni.2888	Rad50-CARD9 interactions link cytosolic DNA sensing to IL-1β production.	Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm triggers the production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) as an antiviral host response, and deregulation of the pathways involved can promote inflammatory disease. Here we report a direct cytosolic interaction between the DNA-damage sensor Rad50 and the innate immune system adaptor CARD9. Transfection of dendritic cells with dsDNA or infection of dendritic cells with a DNA virus induced the formation of dsDNA-Rad50-CARD9 signaling complexes for activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the generation of pro-IL-1β. Primary cells conditionally deficient in Rad50 or lacking CARD9 consequently exhibited defective DNA-induced production of IL-1β, and Card9(-/-) mice had impaired inflammatory responses after infection with a DNA virus in vivo. Our results define a cytosolic DNA-recognition pathway for inflammation and a physical and functional connection between a conserved DNA-damage sensor and the innate immune response to pathogens. 	2014	07	28	Nat Immunol	Roth	Susanne
24792914	10.1016/j.immuni.2014.04.007	Inflammatory T cell responses rely on amino acid transporter ASCT2 facilitation of glutamine uptake and mTORC1 kinase activation.	Glutamine has been implicated as an immunomodulatory nutrient, but how glutamine uptake is mediated during T cell activation is poorly understood. We have shown that naive T cell activation is coupled with rapid glutamine uptake, which depended on the amino acid transporter ASCT2. ASCT2 deficiency impaired the induction of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells and attenuated inflammatory T cell responses in mouse models of immunity and autoimmunity. Mechanistically, ASCT2 was required for T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated activation of the metabolic kinase mTORC1. We have further shown that TCR-stimulated glutamine uptake and mTORC1 activation also required a TCR signaling complex composed of the scaffold protein CARMA1, the adaptor molecule BCL10, and the paracaspase MALT1. This function was independent of IKK kinase, a major downstream target of the CARMA1 complex. These findings highlight a mechanism of T cell activation involving ASCT2-dependent integration of the TCR signal and a metabolic signaling pathway.	2014	07	09	Immunity	Nakaya	Mako
24806599	10.1038/ncomms4755	An ITAM-Syk-CARD9 signalling axis triggers contact hypersensitivity by stimulating IL-1 production in dendritic cells.	A variety of reactive organic compounds, called haptens, can cause allergic contact dermatitis. However, the innate immune mechanisms by which haptens stimulate dendritic cells (DCs) to sensitize T cells remain unclear. Here we show that the coupling of ITAM-Syk-CARD9 signalling to interleukin-1 (IL-1) secretion in DCs is crucial for allergic sensitization to haptens. Both MyD88 and Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) signalling are required for contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Naïve T cells require signals received through IL-1R1-MyD88 for effector differentiation, whereas DCs require CARD9 and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signalling for hapten-induced IL-1α/β secretion and their ability to prime T cells. DC-specific deletion of CARD9, DAP12, Syk or NLRP3, but not MyD88, is sufficient to abolish CHS. All tested haptens, but not irritants, can induce Syk activation, leading to both the CARD9/BCL10-dependent pro-IL-1 synthesis (signal1) and reactive oxygen species-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation (signal2), required for IL-1 secretion. These data unveil an innate immune mechanism crucial for allergic contact sensitization to chemical compounds. 	2015	08	04	Nat Commun	Yasukawa	Shinsuke
24825920	10.1126/scisignal.2004882	T cell receptor signals to NF-κB are transmitted by a cytosolic p62-Bcl10-Malt1-IKK signalosome.	Antigen-mediated stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a key transcriptional regulator of T cell proliferation and effector cell differentiation. TCR signaling to NF-κB requires both the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex and the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex; however, the molecular mechanisms connecting the CBM complex to activation of IKK are incompletely defined. We found that the active IKK complex is a component of a TCR-dependent cytosolic Bcl10-Malt1 signalosome containing the adaptor protein p62, which forms in effector T cells. Phosphorylated IκBα and NF-κB were transiently recruited to this signalosome before NF-κB translocated to the nucleus. Inhibiting the activity of the kinase TAK1 or IKK blocked the phosphorylation of IKK, but not the formation of p62-Bcl10-Malt1 clusters, suggesting that activation of IKK occurs after signalosome assembly. Furthermore, analysis of T cells from p62-deficient mice demonstrated that the p62-dependent clustering of signaling components stimulated activation of NF-κB in effector T cells. Thus, TCR-stimulated activation of NF-κB requires the assembly of cytosolic p62-Bcl10-Malt1-IKK signalosomes, which may ensure highly regulated activation of NF-κB in response to TCR engagement. 	2014	12	31	Sci Signal	Paul	Suman
24917592	10.1126/scisignal.2005169	T cell receptor-dependent activation of mTOR signaling in T cells is mediated by Carma1 and MALT1, but not Bcl10.	Signaling to the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates diverse cellular processes, including protein translation, cellular proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy. Most models place Akt upstream of the mTOR complex, mTORC1; however, in T cells, Akt may not be necessary for mTORC1 activation. We found that the adaptor protein Carma1 [caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing membrane-associated protein 1] and at least one of its associated proteins, the paracaspase MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), were required for optimal activation of mTOR in T cells in response to stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the co-receptor CD28. However, Bcl10, which binds to Carma1 and MALT1 to form a complex that mediates signals from the TCR to the transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB), was not required. The catalytic activity of MALT1 was required for the proliferation of stimulated CD4+ T cells, but not for early TCR-dependent activation events. Consistent with an effect on mTOR, MALT1 activity was required for the increased metabolic flux in activated CD4+ T cells. Together, our data suggest that Carma1 and MALT1 play previously unappreciated roles in the activation of mTOR signaling in T cells after engagement of the TCR.	2015	02	12	Sci Signal	Hamilton	Kristia S
24958727	10.1074/jbc.M114.588723	The adaptor CRADD/RAIDD controls activation of endothelial cells by proinflammatory stimuli.	A hallmark of inflammation, increased vascular permeability, is induced in endothelial cells by multiple agonists through stimulus-coupled assembly of the CARMA3 signalosome, which contains the adaptor protein BCL10. Previously, we reported that BCL10 in immune cells is targeted by the ""death"" adaptor CRADD/RAIDD (CRADD), which negatively regulates nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-dependent cytokine and chemokine expression in T cells (Lin, Q., Liu, Y., Moore, D. J., Elizer, S. K., Veach, R. A., Hawiger, J., and Ruley, H. E. (2012) J. Immunol. 188, 2493-2497). This novel anti-inflammatory CRADD-BCL10 axis prompted us to analyze CRADD expression and its potential anti-inflammatory action in non-immune cells. We focused our study on microvascular endothelial cells because they play a key role in inflammation. We found that CRADD-deficient murine endothelial cells display heightened BCL10-mediated expression of the pleotropic proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in response to LPS and thrombin. Moreover, these agonists also induce significantly increased permeability in cradd(-/-), as compared with cradd(+/+), primary murine endothelial cells. CRADD-deficient cells displayed more F-actin polymerization with concomitant disruption of adherens junctions. In turn, increasing intracellular CRADD by delivery of a novel recombinant cell-penetrating CRADD protein (CP-CRADD) restored endothelial barrier function and suppressed the induction of IL-6 and MCP-1 evoked by LPS and thrombin. Likewise, CP-CRADD enhanced barrier function in CRADD-sufficient endothelial cells. These results indicate that depletion of endogenous CRADD compromises endothelial barrier function in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, we define a novel function for CRADD in endothelial cells as an inducible suppressor of BCL10, a key mediator of responses to proinflammatory agonists. 	2015	02	19	J Biol Chem	Qiao	Huan
25011391	10.1007/s00418-014-1244-8	Combining immunofluorescence with in situ proximity ligation assay: a novel imaging approach to monitor protein-protein interactions in relation to subcellular localization.	The in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is suited for visualizing protein-protein interactions and post-translational protein modifications in both tissue sections and in vitro cell cultures. Accurate identification and quantification of protein-protein interactions are critical for in vitro cell analysis, especially when studying the dynamic involvement of proteins in various processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here, we monitored the interactions between protein kinase-Cζ (PKCζ) and Bcl10 protein in untreated and etoposide (VP-16)-treated C4-I cells by means of a new combined morphological approach and validated it by taking stock of our previous proteomic and biochemical work (Chiarini et al. in J Proteome Res 11:3996-4012, 2012). We first analyzed the colocalization of PKCζ and Bcl10 proteins through classical immunofluorescent colocalization analysis. On the basis of these results, we developed a novel imaging approach combining immunofluorescence (IF) techniques with in situ PLA to identify the PKCζ·Bcl10 complexes at the level of a specific subcellular compartment, i.e., the nuclear envelope (NE). By this means, we could show that the amount of PKCζ·Bcl10 complexes localized at the NE of C4-I cells during proliferation or after treatment with VP-16 closely corresponded to our previous purely biochemical results. Hence, the present findings demonstrate that the combination of in situ PLA with classical IF detection is a novel powerful analytical tool allowing to morphologically demonstrate new specific protein-protein interactions at level of subcellular organelles, the complexes functions of which can next be clarified through proteomic/biochemical approaches. 	2015	10	13	Histochem Cell Biol	Pacchiana	Raffaella
25087226	10.1016/j.jaci.2014.06.015	The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex: Stepping into the limelight of human primary immunodeficiency.	Next-generation DNA sequencing has accelerated the genetic characterization of many human primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These discoveries can be lifesaving for the affected patients and also provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of specific genes on human immune function. In the past 18 months, a number of independent groups have begun to define novel PIDs caused by defects in the caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11)-B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1 [CBM]) signalosome complex. The CBM complex forms an essential molecular link between the triggering of cell-surface antigen receptors and nuclear factor κB activation. Germline mutations affecting the CBM complex are now recognized as the cause of novel combined immunodeficiency phenotypes, which all share abnormal nuclear factor κB activation and dysregulated B-cell development as defining features. For this ""Current perspectives"" article, we have engaged experts in both basic biology and clinical immunology to capture the worldwide experience in recognizing and managing patients with PIDs caused by CBM complex mutations. 	2014	12	05	J Allergy Clin Immunol	Turvey	Stuart E
25105596	10.1371/journal.pone.0103774	MALT1 auto-proteolysis is essential for NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in activated lymphocytes.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) controls antigen receptor-mediated signalling to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through both its adaptor and protease function. Upon antigen stimulation, MALT1 forms a complex with BCL10 and CARMA1, which is essential for initial IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Parallel induction of MALT1 protease activity serves to inactivate negative regulators of NF-κB signalling, such as A20 and RELB. Here we demonstrate a key role for auto-proteolytic MALT1 cleavage in B- and T-cell receptor signalling. MALT1 cleavage occurred after Arginine 149, between the N-terminal death domain and the first immunoglobulin-like region, and did not affect its proteolytic activity. Jurkat T cells expressing an un-cleavable MALT1-R149A mutant showed unaltered initial IκBα phosphorylation and normal nuclear accumulation of NF-κB subunits. Nevertheless, MALT1 cleavage was required for optimal activation of NF-κB reporter genes and expression of the NF-κB targets IL-2 and CSF2. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that MALT1 cleavage after R149 was required to induce NF-κB transcriptional activity in Jurkat T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that auto-proteolytic MALT1 cleavage controls antigen receptor-induced expression of NF-κB target genes downstream of nuclear NF-κB accumulation. 	2015	04	13	PLoS One	Baens	Mathijs
25150998	10.1007/978-1-4939-1212-4_8	Detection of NF-κB pathway activation in T helper cells.	Upon activation of CD4+ T helper cells the transcription factor complex NF-κB becomes activated and its subunits are able to translocate to the nucleus. There, the dimerized proteins regulate the transcription of for example cytokine and pro-survival genes. This process is of central importance for a proper function of T helper cells as its loss causes severe immunodeficiency, whereas its deregulation can contribute to lymphomagenesis or autoimmunity. In this protocol we describe four methods to investigate NF-κB activation in T helper cells by testing (1) the assembly of the Carma1-Malt1-Bcl10 complex by co-immunoprecipitation, (2) the activation of the IKK complex and the degradation of IκBα by western blot analysis, (3) the degradation of IκBα by intracellular flow cytometry, and (4) the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB by nonradioactive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).	2015	04	16	Methods Mol Biol	Gorka	Oliver
25185127	10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03900	Bcl10 mediates angiotensin II-induced cardiac damage and electrical remodeling.	Angiotensin (Ang) II is a potent mediator of both hypertension and cardiac damage; however, the mechanisms by which this occur remain unclear. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) is a member of the CBM signalosome, which links Ang II and nuclear factor-κB signaling. We hypothesized that Bcl10 is pivotal in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced cardiac damage. Ang II infusion in mice lacking Bcl10 resulted in reduced cardiac fibrosis, less cellular infiltration, and improved arrhythmogenic electric remodeling, despite a similar degree of hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow (BM), whereby Bcl10 knockout or wildtype BM was transferred to their opposite genotype recipients, revealed the dual importance of Bcl10 within both cardiac and immune cells. Loss of Bcl10 in cardiac cells resulted in reduced expression of genes important for the adhesion and recruitment of immune cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that adhesion of monocytes to Ang II-treated endothelial cells also required Bcl10. Additionally, Bcl10 deficiency in macrophages reduced their intrinsic migratory ability. To address the role of BM-derived fibroblasts in the formation of cardiac fibrosis, we explored whether Bcl10 is also important for the infiltration of BM-derived (myo)fibroblasts into the heart. The transfer of green fluorescent protein positive wildtype BM into Bcl10 knockout recipient mice revealed a reduced number of noncardiac (myo)fibroblasts compared with those wildtype recipients. Our results demonstrate the significant role of Bcl10 in multiple cell types important for the generation of Ang II-induced cardiac damage and electric remodeling and may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention. 	2015	01	16	Hypertension	Markó	Lajos

25190756	10.1182/blood-2014-03-564609	Inability to resolve specific infection generates innate immunodeficiency syndrome in Xiap-/- mice.	Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunodeficiency syndromes are linked to mutations in innate receptors and to specific infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type-2 (XLP-2) is associated with deficiency in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), with poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Here we showed that XIAP deficiency selectively impaired B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mediated innate responses to dectin-1 ligands but did not affect responses to various Toll-like receptor agonists. Consequently, Xiap(-/-) mice became highly vulnerable on Candida albicans infection. The compromised early innate responses led to the persistent presence of C albicans and inflammatory cytokines in Xiap(-/-) mice. Furthermore, priming of Xiap(-/-) mice with the dectin-1 ligand curdlan alone resulted in XLP-2-like syndromes. Restoration of dectin-1-induced Rac1 activation and phagocytosis by resolvin D1, but not up-regulation of nuclear factor-κB, rescued Xiap(-/-) mice from C albicans lethal infection. Therefore, development of XLP-2 in XIAP-deficient patients could be partly due to sustained inflammation as a consequence of defective BCL10-dependent innate immunity toward specific pathogens. Importantly, our results suggest the potential therapeutic value of resolvin D1 in the treatment of XLP-2 and innate immunodeficiency syndromes. 	2015	02	27	Blood	Hsieh	Wan-Chen
25202022	10.1074/jbc.M114.588574	C-type lectin receptor dectin-3 mediates trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM)-induced Mincle expression through CARD9/Bcl10/MALT1-dependent nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation.	Previous studies indicate that both Dectin-3 (also called MCL or Clec4d) and Mincle (also called Clec4e), two C-type lectin receptors, can recognize trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM), a cell wall component from mycobacteria, and induce potent innate immune responses. Interestingly, stimulation of Dectin-3 by TDM can also induce Mincle expression, which may enhance the host innate immune system to sense Mycobacterium infection. However, the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression is not fully defined. Here, we show that TDM-induced Mincle expression is dependent on Dectin-3-mediated NF-κB, but not nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), activation, and Dectin-3 induces NF-κB activation through the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex. We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages from Dectin-3-deficient mice were severely defective in the induction of Mincle expression in response to TDM stimulation. This defect is correlated with the failure of TDM-induced NF-κB activation in Dectin-3-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistently, inhibition of NF-κB, but not NFAT, impaired TDM-induced Mincle expression, whereas NF-κB, but not NFAT, binds to the Mincle promoter. Dectin-3-mediated NF-κB activation is dependent on the CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1 complex. Finally, mice deficient for Dectin-3 or CARD9 produced much less proinflammatory cytokines and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific antibodies after immunization with an adjuvant containing TDM. Overall, this study provides the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression in response to Mycobacterium infection, which will have significant impact to improve adjuvant and design vaccine for antimicrobial infection. 	2015	02	12	J Biol Chem	Zhao	Xue-Qiang

The CBM complex constitutes a signaling cluster of more than 1 Mio Dalton. Little is known about factors that facilitate the rapid assembly and maintenance of this dynamic higher order complex. Here, we report the novel interaction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) interacting protein (AIP) and the molecular scaffold protein CARMA1. In T cells, transient binding of CARMA1 and AIP enhanced formation of the CBM complex. Thereby, AIP promoted optimal IKK/NF-κB signaling and IL-2 production in response to TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. Our data demonstrate that AIP acts as a positive regulator of NF-κB signaling upon T cell activation.	2015	04	07	Cell Commun Signal	Schimmack	Gisela
25320244	10.1182/blood-2014-07-589689	Inhibiting CARD11 translation during BCR activation by targeting the eIF4A RNA helicase.	Human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) often aberrantly express oncogenes that generally contain complex secondary structures in their 5' untranslated region (UTR). Oncogenes with complex 5'UTRs require enhanced eIF4A RNA helicase activity for translation. PDCD4 inhibits eIF4A, and PDCD4 knockout mice have a high penetrance for B-cell lymphomas. Here, we show that on B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated p70s6K activation, PDCD4 is degraded, and eIF4A activity is greatly enhanced. We identified a subset of genes involved in BCR signaling, including CARD11, BCL10, and MALT1, that have complex 5'UTRs and encode proteins with short half-lives. Expression of these known oncogenic proteins is enhanced on BCR activation and is attenuated by the eIF4A inhibitor Silvestrol. Antigen-experienced immunoglobulin (Ig)G(+) splenic B cells, from which most DLBCLs are derived, have higher levels of eIF4A cap-binding activity and protein translation than IgM(+) B cells. Our results suggest that eIF4A-mediated enhancement of oncogene translation may be a critical component for lymphoma progression, and specific targeting of eIF4A may be an attractive therapeutic approach in the management of human B-cell lymphomas. 	2015	02	20	Blood	Steinhardt	James J
25365219	10.1172/JCI77493	Inherited BCL10 deficiency impairs hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity.	Heterotrimers composed of B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1), and caspase recruitment domain-containing (CARD) family adaptors play a role in NF-κB activation and have been shown to be involved in both the innate and the adaptive arms of immunity in murine models. Moreover, individuals with inherited defects of MALT1, CARD9, and CARD11 present with immunological and clinical phenotypes. Here, we characterized a case of autosomal-recessive, complete BCL10 deficiency in a child with a broad immunodeficiency, including defects of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. The patient died at 3 years of age and was homozygous for a loss-of-expression, loss-of-function BCL10 mutation. The effect of BCL10 deficiency was dependent on the signaling pathway, and, for some pathways, the cell type affected. Despite the noted similarities to BCL10 deficiency in mice, including a deficient adaptive immune response, human BCL10 deficiency in this patient resulted in a number of specific features within cell populations. Treatment of the patient's myeloid cells with a variety of pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) elicited a normal response; however, NF-κB-mediated fibroblast functions were dramatically impaired. The results of this study indicate that inherited BCL10 deficiency should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency with B cell, T cell, and fibroblast defects. 	2015	07	08	J Clin Invest	Torres	Juan Manuel
25384343	10.1186/s40001-014-0062-8	Characteristics of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-A20-NF-κB expression in T cell-acute lymphocytic leukemia.	Knowledge of the oncogenic signaling pathways of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains limited. Constitutive aberrant activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway has been detected in various lymphoid malignancies and plays a key role in the development of these carcinomas. The zinc finger-containing protein, A20, is a central regulator of multiple NF-κB-activating signaling cascades. A20 is frequently inactivated by deletions and/or mutations in several B-and T-cell lymphoma subtypes. However, few A20 mutations and polymorphisms have been reported in T-ALL. Thus, it is of interest to analyze the expression characteristics of A20 and its regulating factors, including upstream regulators and the CBM complex, which includes CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1. The expression levels of CARMA1, BCL10, MALT1, A20, and NF-κB were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 21 patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL using real-time PCR, and correlations between the aberrant expression of these genes in T-ALL was analyzed. Sixteen healthy individuals, including 10 males and 6 females, served as controls. Significantly lower A20 expression was found in T-ALL patients (median: 4.853) compared with healthy individuals (median: 8.748; P = 0.017), and significantly increased expression levels of CARMA1 (median: 2.916; P = 0.034), BCL10 (median: 0.285; P = 0.033), and MALT1 (median: 1.201; P = 0.010) were found in T-ALL compared with the healthy individuals (median: 1.379, 0.169, and 0.677, respectively). In contrast, overexpression of NF-κB (median: 0.714) was found in T-ALL compared with healthy individuals (median: 0.335; P = 0.001). A negative correlation between the MALT1 and A20 expression levels and a positive correlation between CARMA1 and BCL10 were found in T-ALL and healthy individuals. However, no negative correlation was found between A20 and NF-κB and the MALT1 and NF-κB expression level in the T-ALL group. We characterized the expression of the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1-A20-NF-κB pathway genes in T-ALL. Overexpression of CARMA-BCL10-MALT in T-ALL may contribute to the constitutive cleavage and inactivation of A20, which enhances NF-κB signaling and may be related to T-ALL pathogenesis.	2015	03	13	Eur J Med Res	Ma	Yu
25536807	10.2298/vsp130813035h	BCL10 aberations and NF-kappa B activation involving p65 are absent or rare in primary gastric MALT lymphoma.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma accounts for 5-17% non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The molecular pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas is not well-established. The aim of this study was to evaluate immunohistochemically determined nuclear coexpression of BCL10 and NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in tumor cells of gastric MALT lymphoma and its impact on the patogenesis and outcome of the disease. Medical records of 35 patients with newly diagnosed gastric MALT lymphoma were analyzed and biopsy specimens were immunostained for BCL10 and NF-kappaB expression (p65 subunit). The median age of 35 patients diagnosed with gastric MALT lymphoma was 63.5 years (male/female = 21/14). Symptoms were present in 23/35 (65.7%) patients with the weight loss as the most common symptom. Gastric MALT lymphomas were usually localized in the stomach corpus and corpus and antrum (45.7% and 31.2%, respectively). H. pylon infection was confirmed in 20 out of 30 (66.7%) patients. Treatment options were as follows: immunochemotherapy in 10 (28.5%) patients, surgery in 9 (25.8%) patients, combined surgery and chemotherapy in 14 (40%) patients and supportive measures in 2 (5.7%) patients. Complete remission was achieved in 13 (37.10/) patients and partial remission in two (5.7%/) patients. Sixteen (45.7%/) patients had disease progression (p &lt; 0.001). Cytoplasmatic expression of BCL10 in tumor cells was detected in 19 (54.3%) specimens. Nuclear expression was detected in no specimen. Cytoplasmic expression of NF-kappaB was present in 22 (65.7%) specimens, but nuclear expression was not detected in any specimens. Nuclear expressions (activation)of NF-kappaB p65 subunit and BCL10 were not detected in specimens of gastric MALT lymphoma. The correlation of nuclear coexpression of BCL10 and NF-kappaB in gastric MALT lymphoma was not established. These results indicate that other mechanisms and signal pathways are active in lymphogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma, as that apoptotic inhibition is not the main, nor the only mechanism in tumorogenesis.	2015	07	16	Vojnosanit Pregl	Hajder	Jelena
23149938	10.1128/MCB.00850-12	A quantitative signaling screen identifies CARD11 mutations in the CARD and LATCH domains that induce Bcl10 ubiquitination and human lymphoma cell survival.	Antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, essential for normal lymphocyte activation, is dysregulated in several types of lymphoma. During normal signaling, the multidomain adapter CARD11 transitions from a closed, inactive state to an open, active scaffold that assembles a multiprotein complex, leading to NF-κB activation. The regulation of CARD11 scaffold function is bypassed by lymphoma-associated oncogenic CARD11 mutations that induce spontaneous signaling. We report an unbiased high-throughput quantitative signaling screen that identifies new CARD11 hyperactive variants and defines a LATCH domain that functions with the CARD to promote CARD11 autoinhibition. Gain-of-function mutations in the LATCH or CARD disrupt inhibitory domain binding, promote Bcl10 association, and induce Bcl10 ubiquitination, NF-κB activation, and human lymphoma cell survival. Our results identify CARD11 mutations with oncogenic potential, provide a mechanistic explanation for their signaling potency, and offer a straightforward method for the discovery of variants that promote the tumorigenesis of NF-κB-dependent lymphomas.	2013	02	21	Mol Cell Biol	Chan	Waipan
23252516	10.1111/bjh.12172	Lenalidomide efficacy in activated B-cell-like subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is dependent upon IRF4 and cereblon expression.	Durable responses with lenalidomide monotherapy have been reported in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), higher responses were observed in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype than in the germinal centre B-cell-like subtype. Herein, the molecular mechanisms involved in the differential efficacy of lenalidomide in DLBCL subtypes were investigated. Using DLBCL cell lines, lenalidomide treatment was found to preferentially suppress proliferation of ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro and delay tumour growth in a human tumour xenograft model, with minimal effect on non-ABC-DLBCL cells. This tumouricidal effect was associated with downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a hallmark of ABC-DLBCL cells. IRF4 inhibition by lenalidomide induced downregulation of B-cell receptor (BCR)-dependent NF-κB. Whereas IRF4-specific small, interfering RNA mimicked the effects of lenalidomide reducing NF-κB activation, IRF4 overexpression enhanced NF-κB activation and conferred resistance to lenalidomide. These findings indicate the crucial role of IRF4 inhibition in lenalidomide efficacy in ABC cells. Furthermore, lenalidomide-induced IRF4 downregulation required the expression of cereblon, a molecular target of lenalidomide. Taken together, these findings suggest that lenalidomide has direct antitumour activity against DLBCL cells, preferentially ABC-DLBCL cells, by blocking IRF4 expression and the BCR-NF-κB signalling pathway in a cereblon-dependent manner.	2013	06	17	Br J Haematol	Zhang	Ling-Hua
23297344	10.1128/MCB.06407-11	Kinase-independent feedback of the TAK1/TAB1 complex on BCL10 turnover and NF-κB activation.	Antigen receptors activate pathways that control cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Two important targets of antigen receptors, NF-κB and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), are activated downstream of CARMA1, a scaffolding protein that nucleates a complex including BCL10, MALT1, and other IκB kinase (IKK)-signalosome components. Somatic mutations that constitutively activate CARMA1 occur frequently in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mediate essential survival signals. Mechanisms that downregulate this pathway might thus yield important therapeutic targets. Stimulation of antigen receptors induces not only BCL10 activation but also its degradation downstream of CARMA1, thereby ultimately limiting signals to its downstream targets. Here, using lymphocyte cell models, we identify a kinase-independent requirement for TAK1 and its adaptor, TAB1, in antigen receptor-induced BCL10 degradation. We show that TAK1 acts as an adaptor for E3 ubiquitin ligases that target BCL10 for degradation. Functionally, TAK1 overexpression restrains CARMA1-dependent activation of NF-κB by reducing BCL10 levels. TAK1 also promotes counterselection of NF-κB-addicted DLBCL lines by a dual mechanism involving kinase-independent degradation of BCL10 and kinase-dependent activation of JNK. Thus, by directly promoting BCL10 degradation, TAK1 counterbalances NF-κB and JNK signals essential for the activation and survival of lymphocytes and CARMA1-addicted lymphoma types.	2013	07	05	Mol Cell Biol	Moreno-García	Miguel E
23393199	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2362	Hyperactivated JNK is a therapeutic target in pVHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma.	Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), the major histologic subtype of RCC accounting for more than 80% of cases, are typified by biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Although accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-α) is the most well-studied effect of VHL inactivation, direct inhibition of HIFα or restoration of wild-type pVHL protein expression has not proved readily feasible, given the limitations associated with pharmacologic targeting of transcription factors (i.e., HIF-α) and gene replacement therapy of tumor suppressor genes (i.e., VHL). Here, we have established that phosphorylated c-Jun, a substrate of the c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase (JNK), is selectively activated in clear cell RCC patient specimens. Using multiple isogenic cell lines, we show that HIF-α-independent JNK hyperactivation is unique to the pVHL-deficient state. Importantly, pVHL-deficient RCCs are dependent upon JNK activity for in vitro and in vivo growth. A multistep signaling pathway that links pVHL loss to JNK activation involves the formation of a CARD9/BCL10/TRAF6 complex as a proximal signal to sequentially stimulate TAK1 (MAPKKK), MKK4 (MAPKK), and JNK (MAPK). JNK stimulates c-Jun phosphorylation, activation, and dimerization with c-Fos to form a transcriptionally competent AP1 complex that drives transcription of the Twist gene and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, JNK represents a novel molecular target that is selectively activated in and drives the growth of pVHL-deficient clear cell RCCs. These findings can serve as the preclinical foundation for directed efforts to characterize potent pharmacologic inhibitors of the JNK pathway for clinical translation.	2013	04	15	Cancer Res	An	Jiabin
23463379	10.1002/ijc.28148	Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II contributes to inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B kinase complex activation in Helicobacter pylori infection.	Helicobacter pylori, a class I carcinogen, induces a proinflammatory response by activating the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in gastric epithelial cells. This inflammatory condition could lead to chronic gastritis, which is epidemiologically and biologically linked to the development of gastric cancer. So far, there exists no clear knowledge on how H. pylori induces the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. In our study, we investigated the role of Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII), calmodulin, protein kinases C (PKCs) and the CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex in conjunction with H. pylori-induced activation of NF-κB via the inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B kinase (IKK) complex. We use specific inhibitors and/or RNA interference to assess the contribution of these components. Our results show that CAMKII and calmodulin contribute to IKK complex activation and thus to the induction of NF-κB in response to H. pylori infection, but not in response to TNF-α. Thus, our findings are specific for H. pylori infected cells. Neither the PKCs α, δ, θ, nor the CBM complex itself is involved in the activation of NF-κB by H. pylori. The contribution of CAMKII and calmodulin, but not PKCs/CBM to the induction of an inflammatory response by H. pylori infection augment the understanding of the molecular mechanism involved and provide potential new disease markers for the diagnosis of gastric inflammatory diseases including gastric cancer.	2013	09	12	Int J Cancer	Maubach	Gunter
23525237	10.3892/ijmm.2013.1307	Self-oligomerization of the CARD domain prevents complex formation in the CARMA1 signalosome.	The CARMA1 signalosome composed of CARMA1, BCL10 and MALT1 plays a pivotal role in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation via the NF-κB pathway. For assembly of the CARMA1 signalosome, BCL10 functions as an adaptor protein that interacts with CARMA1 via the CARD-CARD interaction and with MALT1 via interaction between the C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich region of BCL10 and the first Ig domain of MALT1. Despite the biological importance of the CARMA1 signalosome, structural and biochemical studies have been limited as CARD-containing proteins are prone to aggregation under physiological conditions. In the present study, we successfully purified and characterized CARMA1 CARD and BCL10 CARD and showed that both CARMA1 CARD and BCL10 CARD easily self-oligomerized under physiological conditions. This self-oligomerization of the CARD domain prevents complex formation in the CARMA1 signalosome in vitro. Finally, we propose an interaction mode between CARMA1 CARD and BCL10 CARD based on a structure-based modeling study.	2013	10	29	Int J Mol Med	Park	Jin Hee
23530562	10.1111/pin.12045	BCL10 as a useful marker for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, especially using endoscopic ultrasound cytology specimens.	Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) of the pancreas are characterized by the histological and immunohistochemical features of acinar cell differentiation. Recently, BCL10, originally identified as a recurrent t(1;14)(p22;q32) translocation in MALT B-cell lymphoma, was found to be immunohistochemically positive in some solid tumors, including ACC. To evaluate its diagnostic efficacy, we performed BCL10 immunohistochemistry and evaluated molecular markers correlated to pancreatic tumor lineages (neuroendocrine markers and a mutation analysis of KRAS and GNAS) using samples from 126 pancreatic tumors (17 ACCs, 24 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, 4 adenosquamous carcinomas, 9 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 10 mucinous cystic neoplasms, 44 neuroendocrine tumors, 9 serous cystic tumors and 10 solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms). BCL10 was exclusively expressed in normal acini. In pancreatic tumors, 14 of 17 (82%) ACCs and 2 of 4 (50%) adenosquamous carcinomas were positive, while the other subtypes were almost negative. We subsequently examined the diagnostic utility of BCL10 in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) specimens using 57 pancreatic tumors. BLC10 correctly identified ACCs (9/13) and adenosquamous carcinomas (2/4) but none of the other subtypes (n = 41). Therefore, we suggested that BCL10 expression is a useful marker for acinar cell differentiation, particularly in the diagnosis of EUS-FNA specimens.	2013	09	24	Pathol Int	Hosoda	Waki
23545653	10.1107/S1744309113005642	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of the CARD domain of human CARMA1.	The CARMA1 signalosome, which is composed of CARMA1 [caspase recruitment domain (CARD) containing MAGUK protein 1], BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma 10) and MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), is a molecular-signalling complex that performs pivotal functions in T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated NF-κB activation. In this study, the CARD domain of human CARMA1 (CARMA1 CARD), corresponding to amino acids 14-109, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using an engineered C-terminal His tag. CARMA1 CARD was then purified to homogeneity and crystallized at 293 K. Finally, X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 3.2 Å from a crystal belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit-cell parameters a = 45.73, b = 53.37, c = 91.89 Å.	2013	12	18	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Park	Jin Hee
23616440	10.1002/glia.22502	Amyloid beta deregulates astroglial mGluR5-mediated calcium signaling via calcineurin and Nf-kB.	The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that soluble amyloid β (Aβ) is an initiator of a cascade of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Recently, we reported that Aβ deranged Ca(2+) homeostasis specifically in hippocampal astrocytes by targeting key elements of Ca(2+) signaling, such as mGluR5 and IP3 R1. In the present study, we dissect a cascade of signaling events by which Aβ deregulates glial Ca(2+) : (i) 100 nM Aβ leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium after 4-6 h of treatment; (ii) mGluR5 is increased after 24 h of treatment; (iii) this increase is blocked by inhibitors of calcineurin (CaN) and NF-kB. Furthermore, we show that Aβ treatment of glial cells leads to de-phosphorylation of Bcl10 and an increased CaN-Bcl10 interaction. Last, mGluR5 staining is augmented in hippocampal astrocytes of AD patients in proximity of Aβ plaques and co-localizes with nuclear accumulation of the p65 NF-kB subunit and increased staining of CaNAα. Taken together our data suggest that nanomolar [Aβ] deregulates Ca(2+) homeostasis via CaN and its downstream target NF-kB, possibly via the cross-talk of Bcl10 in hippocampal astrocytes.	2014	02	10	Glia	Lim	Dmitry
23632891	10.1182/blood-2012-12-470153	Trimeric G protein-CARMA1 axis links smoothened, the hedgehog receptor transducer, to NF-κB activation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways is ubiquitously observed and known to mediate tumor growth, survival, and chemoresistance in DLBCL. Here, we find that activation of Hh signaling is positively correlated with NF-κB pathway in DLBCL tumors, and that smoothened (SMO), the signal transducer subunit of Hh pathway, contributes to NF-κB activation through recruiting G protein subunits Gαi and Gα12 to activate PKCβ/CARMA1/TRAF6/NEMO signaling axis followed by assembling of the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1/TRAF6 complex to SMO. Moreover, functional inhibition of SMO enhances the cytotoxic effects of NF-κB inhibitor. Altogether, our study reveals a noncanonical Hh signaling pathway in which SMO activates trimeric G proteins and CARMA1-associated signaling complex, leading to NF-κB activation. This signaling cascade contributes to the survival of DLBCL and may serve as a potential target for combination therapies in DLBCL.	2013	08	06	Blood	Qu	Changju
23661444	10.4238/2013.April.12.6	Significance of Bcl10 gene mutations in the clinical diagnosis of MALT-type ocular adnexal lymphoma in the Chinese population.	We investigated the expression of Bcl10 gene mutations in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL), atypical lymphoid hyperplasia (ALH), and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) in the Chinese population and its role in clinical diagnosis and pathogenesis. Forty-three samples were collected during patient surgeries. Pathological diagnosis confirmed OAL in 23 cases, ALH in 10 cases, and RLH in 10 cases. Normal peripheral lymph tissues from 12 cases were used as negative controls. Bcl10 gene expression was examined using molecular biological methods, and DNA sequences and mutations were compared with published data. The protein expression of Bcl10 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) were detected with immunohistological and immunofluorescence colocalization. Bcl10 gene expression was detected in 15 OAL cases. Novel mutations were found in 11 cases. Notably, 1 mutation, which matched a published mutation, was detected in 1 ALH case; 1 novel mutation was found in 1 RLH case; and no Bcl10 gene mutation was found in controls. Most novel mutations were truncation mutations, resulting in a truncated protein product of 99 amino acids (compared to the full-length 233 amino acids; GenBank accession No. EF189176). Results of tests for abnormal Bcl10 gene expression in nuclei or cytoplasm were consistent with changes in NF-κB translocation. This report is the first of newly discovered mutations in the Bcl10 gene in the Chinese population. The distribution of the mutations is consistent with and more sensitive than that of the pathological diagnosis. These mutations can be used to identify the stage and clinical characteristics even when morphological changes are absent.	2013	10	22	Genet Mol Res	Zhu	J
23677497	10.1007/s13105-013-0259-2	Bcl10 is an essential regulator for A20 gene expression.	A20, a tumor suppressor in several types of lymphomas, has been suggested to be an nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) target gene; conversely, the deubiquitylation activity of A20 is required for inhibition of Bcl10-mediated activation of NF-κB. BCL10, which is activated in a recurrent chromosomal translocation that causes human mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, is known to be essential for NF-κB activation in B cells. We report here that Bcl10 upregulates endogenous A20 gene expression in B lymphocytes upon B-cell receptor engagement of anti-IgM. Transient transfection assays in HEK 293 cells indicate that Bcl10 can activate the A20 promoter, which contains NF-κB-binding sites. We also construct a theoretical structure of mouse Bcl10 and analyze the structure by molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. Lastly, we found that marginal zone B cells from BCL10-transgenic mice proliferate more readily than wild-type B cells, whereas, surprisingly, the transgenic follicular B cells from these mice proliferate comparably to wild-type cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Bcl10 is an essential regulator of A20 gene expression and B-cell proliferation mediated by B-cell receptor signaling. 	2014	07	17	J Physiol Biochem	Xu	Wu
23690623	10.1073/pnas.1221925110	Regulation of T cell function by the ubiquitin-specific protease USP9X via modulating the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex.	The ubiquitin conjugation system plays an important role in immune regulation; however, the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) that carry out deubiquitination of cellular substrates are poorly understood. Here we show that in vivo knockdown of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X attenuates T-cell proliferation. In addition, naïve CD4(+) T cells from USP9X knockdown chimeric mice display decreased cytokine production and T helper cell differentiation in vitro, which we confirmed in vivo by performing adoptive transfer of transgenic T cells and subsequent immunization. USP9X silencing in both a human T-cell line and mouse primary T cells reduced T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling-induced NF-κB activation. Mechanistically, USP9X interacts with Bcl10 of the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex and removes the TCR-induced ubiquitin chain from Bcl10, which facilitates the association of Carma1 with Bcl0-Malt1. These results demonstrate that USP9X is a crucial positive regulator of the TCR signaling pathway and is required for T-cell function through the modulation of CBM complex formation.	2013	08	06	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Park	Yoon
23766559	10.1155/2013/397642	Carrageenan-induced colonic inflammation is reduced in Bcl10 null mice and increased in IL-10-deficient mice.	The common food additive carrageenan is a known activator of inflammation in mammalian tissues and stimulates both the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation. Exposure to low concentrations of carrageenan (10 μ g/mL in the water supply) has produced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin signaling in C57BL/6 mice. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) is a mediator of inflammatory signals from Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in myeloid and epithelial cells. Since the TLR4 signaling pathway is activated in diabetes and by carrageenan, we addressed systemic and intestinal inflammatory responses following carrageenan exposure in Bcl10 wild type, heterozygous, and null mice. Fecal calprotectin and circulating keratinocyte chemokine (KC), nuclear RelA and RelB, phospho(Thr559)-NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), and phospho(Ser36)-IκBα in the colonic epithelial cells were significantly less (P &lt; 0.001) in the carrageenan-treated Bcl10 null mice than in controls. IL-10-deficient mice exposed to carrageenan in a germ-free environment showed an increase in activation of the canonical pathway of NF-κB (RelA) activation, but without increase in RelB or phospho-Bcl10, and exogenous IL-10 inhibited only the canonical pathway of NF- κ B activation in cultured colonic cells. These findings demonstrate a Bcl10 requirement for maximum development of carrageenan-induced inflammation and lack of complete suppression by IL-10 of carrageenan-induced inflammation.	2013	12	03	Mediators Inflamm	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
23770291	10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.06.007	Antagonistic crosstalk between NF-κB and SIRT1 in the regulation of inflammation and metabolic disorders.	Recent studies have indicated that the regulation of innate immunity and energy metabolism are connected together through an antagonistic crosstalk between NF-κB and SIRT1 signaling pathways. NF-κB signaling has a major role in innate immunity defense while SIRT1 regulates the oxidative respiration and cellular survival. However, NF-κB signaling can stimulate glycolytic energy flux during acute inflammation, whereas SIRT1 activation inhibits NF-κB signaling and enhances oxidative metabolism and the resolution of inflammation. SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB signaling directly by deacetylating the p65 subunit of NF-κB complex. SIRT1 stimulates oxidative energy production via the activation of AMPK, PPARα and PGC-1α and simultaneously, these factors inhibit NF-κB signaling and suppress inflammation. On the other hand, NF-κB signaling down-regulates SIRT1 activity through the expression of miR-34a, IFNγ, and reactive oxygen species. The inhibition of SIRT1 disrupts oxidative energy metabolism and stimulates the NF-κB-induced inflammatory responses present in many chronic metabolic and age-related diseases. We will examine the molecular mechanisms of the antagonistic signaling between NF-κB and SIRT1 and describe how this crosstalk controls inflammatory process and energy metabolism. In addition, we will discuss how disturbances in this signaling crosstalk induce the appearance of chronic inflammation in metabolic diseases. 	2014	03	03	Cell Signal	Kauppinen	Anu
23784377	10.1093/hmg/ddt286	An association study of TOLL and CARD with leprosy susceptibility in Chinese population.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified multiple susceptibility loci that have highlighted the important role of TLR (Toll-like receptor) and CARD (caspase recruitment domain) genes in leprosy. A large three-stage candidate gene-based association study of 30 TLR and 47 CARD genes was performed in the leprosy samples of Chinese Han. Of 4363 SNPs investigated, eight SNPs showed suggestive association (P &lt; 0.01) in our previously published GWAS datasets (Stage 1). Of the eight SNPs, rs2735591 and rs4889841 showed significant association (P &lt; 0.001) in an independent series of 1504 cases and 1502 controls (Stage 2), but only rs2735591 (next to BCL10) showed significant association in the second independent series of 938 cases and 5827 controls (Stage 3). Rs2735591 showed consistent association across the three stages (P &gt; 0.05 for heterogeneity test), significant association in the combined validation samples (Pcorrected = 5.54 × 10(-4) after correction for 4363 SNPs tested) and genome-wide significance in the whole GWAS and validation samples (P = 1.03 × 10(-9), OR = 1.24). In addition, we demonstrated the lower expression of BCL10 in leprosy lesions than normal skins and a significant gene connection between BCL10 and the eight previously identified leprosy loci that are associated with NFκB, a major regulator of downstream inflammatory responses, which provides further biological evidence for the association. We have discovered a novel susceptibility locus on 1p22, which implicates BCL10 as a new susceptibility gene for leprosy. Our finding highlights the important role of both innate and adaptive immune responses in leprosy. 	2014	04	30	Hum Mol Genet	Liu	Hong
23827971	10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.06.002	Impaired autophagy and APP processing in Alzheimer's disease: The potential role of Beclin 1 interactome.	The accumulation of amyloid-β-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-β peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-β. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. 	2014	03	27	Prog Neurobiol	Salminen	Antero
23918355	10.1073/pnas.1303669110	Inhibition of pluripotent stem cell-derived teratoma formation by small molecules.	The future of safe cell-based therapy rests on overcoming teratoma/tumor formation, in particular when using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Because the presence of a few remaining undifferentiated hPSCs can cause undesirable teratomas after transplantation, complete removal of these cells with no/minimal damage to differentiated cells is a prerequisite for clinical application of hPSC-based therapy. Having identified a unique hESC signature of pro- and antiapoptotic gene expression profile, we hypothesized that targeting hPSC-specific antiapoptotic factor(s) (i.e., survivin or Bcl10) represents an efficient strategy to selectively eliminate pluripotent cells with teratoma potential. Here we report the successful identification of small molecules that can effectively inhibit these antiapoptotic factors, leading to selective and efficient removal of pluripotent stem cells through apoptotic cell death. In particular, a single treatment of hESC-derived mixed population with chemical inhibitors of survivin (e.g., quercetin or YM155) induced selective and complete cell death of undifferentiated hPSCs. In contrast, differentiated cell types (e.g., dopamine neurons and smooth-muscle cells) derived from hPSCs survived well and maintained their functionality. We found that quercetin-induced selective cell death is caused by mitochondrial accumulation of p53 and is sufficient to prevent teratoma formation after transplantation of hESC- or hiPSC-derived cells. Taken together, these results provide the ""proof of concept"" that small-molecule targeting of hPSC-specific antiapoptotic pathway(s) is a viable strategy to prevent tumor formation by selectively eliminating remaining undifferentiated pluripotent cells for safe hPSC-based therapy. 	2013	11	22	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Lee	Mi-Ok
24004675	10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3869	Molecular pathways: targeting MALT1 paracaspase activity in lymphoma.	MALT1 mediates the activation of NF-κB in response to antigen receptor signaling. MALT1, in association with BCL10 and CARD11, functions as a scaffolding protein to activate the inhibitor of IκB kinase (IKK) complex. In addition, MALT1 is a paracaspase that targets key proteins in a feedback loop mediating termination of the NF-κB response, thus promoting activation of NF-κB signaling. Activated B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCL), which tend to be more resistant to chemotherapy, are often biologically dependent on MALT1 activity. Newly developed MALT1 small-molecule inhibitors suppress the growth of ABC-DLBCLs in vitro and in vivo. This review highlights the recent advances in the normal and disease-related functions of MALT1. Furthermore, recent progress targeting MALT1 proteolytic activity raises the possibility of deploying MALT1 inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and perhaps autoimmune diseases that involve increased B- or T-cell receptor signaling.	2014	08	26	Clin Cancer Res	Fontán	Lorena
24036998	10.1038/ni.2708	Signaling by Fyn-ADAP via the Carma1-Bcl-10-MAP3K7 signalosome exclusively regulates inflammatory cytokine production in NK cells.	Inflammation is a critical component of the immune response. However, acute or chronic inflammation can be highly destructive. Uncontrolled inflammation forms the basis for allergy, asthma and various autoimmune disorders. Here we identified a signaling pathway that was exclusively responsible for the production of inflammatory cytokines but not for cytotoxicity. Recognition of tumor cells expressing the NK cell-activatory ligands H60 or CD137L by mouse natural killer (NK) cells led to efficient cytotoxicity and the production of inflammatory cytokines. Both of those effector functions required the kinases Lck, Fyn and PI(3)K (subunits p85α and p110δ) and the signaling protein PLC-γ2. However, a complex of Fyn and the adaptor ADAP exclusively regulated the production of inflammatory cytokines but not cytotoxicity in NK cells. That unique function of ADAP required a Carma1-Bcl-10-MAP3K7 signaling axis. Our results have identified molecules that can be targeted to regulate inflammation without compromising NK cell cytotoxicity. 	2013	12	13	Nat Immunol	Rajasekaran	Kamalakannan
24074955	10.1016/j.molcel.2013.08.032	Structural architecture of the CARMA1/Bcl10/MALT1 signalosome: nucleation-induced filamentous assembly.	The CARMA1/Bcl10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome mediates antigen receptor-induced NF-κB signaling to regulate multiple lymphocyte functions. While CARMA1 and Bcl10 contain caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), MALT1 is a paracaspase with structural similarity to caspases. Here we show that the reconstituted CBM signalosome is a helical filamentous assembly in which substoichiometric CARMA1 nucleates Bcl10 filaments. Bcl10 filament formation is a highly cooperative process whose threshold is sensitized by oligomerized CARMA1 upon receptor activation. In cells, both cotransfected CARMA1/Bcl10 complex and the endogenous CBM signalosome are filamentous morphologically. Combining crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy, we reveal the structure of the Bcl10 CARD filament and the mode of interaction between CARMA1 and Bcl10. Structure-guided mutagenesis confirmed the observed interfaces in Bcl10 filament assembly and MALT1 activation in vitro and NF-κB activation in cells. These data support a paradigm of nucleation-induced signal transduction with threshold response due to cooperativity and signal amplification by polymerization.	2013	12	09	Mol Cell	Qiao	Qi

21954216	10.1002/pbc.23331	Inhibition of caspase-8 activity caused by overexpression of BCL10 contributes to the pathogenesis of high-grade MALT lymphoma.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma comprises approximately 8% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is the most common lymphoma in the gastro-intestinal tract. It is caused by genetic abnormalities or bacterial infections/chronic inflammation. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) overexpression and nuclear expression have been associated with high-grade MALT lymphomas with genetic abnormalities that are unresponsive to Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. To explore the molecular mechanism of BCL10 overexpression on the pathogenesis and malignant phenotype of MALT lymphoma, we generated EµSR-BCL10 transgenic mice. By generation of heterozygous and homozygous EuSR-BCL10 mice and showing BCL10 expression levels in these mice, we quantitatively examined relation of MZ B cell expansion and inhibition of caspase-8 activity with BCL10 protein level. We also investigated API2 and caspase-8 expression by Western blot and their interaction with BCL10 by co-immunoprecipitation. MZ B-cell expansion is directly related to BCL10 protein level in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of caspases-8 and -3, but not caspase-9, was inhibited with increasing of BCL10 protein level. Expanded MZ B cells showed selective survival under stimulation of anti-immunoglobulin M, but not dexamethasone, γ-irradiation, or anti-CD95, implying that overexpressed BCL10 exerts anti-apoptotic effects through B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) pathway. Overexpressed BCL10 protein co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-8 and API2 protein, suggesting an in vivo interaction of them. Our data demonstrate a novel effect of overexpressed BCL10 in the pathogenesis of high-grade MALT lymphoma by increasing expression of API2 and it then forming a protein complex with BCL10/caspase-8 leading to caspase-8 activity suppression.	2012	05	16	Pediatr Blood Cancer	Chen	Yan
21988643	10.3109/10428194.2011.631157	Molecular pathogenesis and histologic and clinical features of extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type (EMZL) is considered an antigen driven lymphoid malignancy associated with protracted antigenic stimulation by microbial pathogens, auto-antigens or other unknown stimuli, which trigger a sustained lymphoid proliferation at sites normally devoid of lymphoid tissue. With the progression of disease, chromosomal aberrations may occur. They result in aberrant activation of signaling pathways which lead to the lymphoproliferation becoming independent of antigenic stimulation. The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway plays a central role in the lymphomagenesis of EMZL. Four mutually exclusive chromosomal translocations have been identified that lead to the up-regulation of either BCL10 or MALT1 or the generation of a fusion protein, cIAP2-MALT1, and induce aberrant activation of the NF-κB pathway. In translocation-negative EMZL, inactivation of the global NF-κB inhibitor A20 might play an important role. These genetic abnormalities alone are insufficient for malignant transformation. Other factors, such as cell surface and chemokine receptors and factors involved with immune and inflammatory response, play their own unique role in the development of a malignant EMZL and may determine its unique clinico-pathological presentation. This review provides an overview of the histologic and clinical features of EMZL and discusses the current insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of EMZL.	2012	10	09	Leuk Lymphoma	Kuper-Hommel	Marion J J
22079206	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.05.012	Molecular signature of kappa-carrageenan mimics chondroitin-4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate and enables interaction with arylsulfatase B.	The common food additive kappa-carrageenan (κ-CGN) is a sulfated polysaccharide that resembles chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate (DS). All have a sulfate group on C4 of a glycoside (galactose for CGN and N-acetylgalactosamine for C4S), and the sulfate-bearing glycoside is linked in a β-1,4-configuration to an unsulfated, six-carbon sugar (galactose for CGN, glucuronate for C4S and iduronate for DS). The enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate) is the highly selective enzyme that removes the four-sulfate group from the nonreducing terminus of C4S and DS, thereby regulating subsequent degradation. In this report, κ-CGN is shown to be a substrate for recombinant human ARSB (rhARSB). Sulfate was generated from both C4S and κ-CGN following incubation with rhARSB. Exposure of human colonic epithelial cells to κ-CGN, but not to C4S, produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. The ROS production from κ-CGN was reduced by exposure to rhARSB, but increased by competition from C4S or DS, but not from chondroitin-6-sulfate. Prior treatment of either lambda- or iota-CGN with rhARSB had no impact on ROS, IL-8 or inorganic sulfate production, demonstrating a specific effect of the molecular configuration of κ-CGN. By mimicry of C4S and DS and by interaction with ARSB, κ-CGN can directly interfere with the normal cellular functions of C4S, DS and ARSB. Since C4S and DS are present in high concentration in tissues, the impact of κ-CGN exposure may be due to some extent to interference with the normal biological functions of ARSB, C4S and DS.	2013	01	24	J Nutr Biochem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
22323537	10.4049/jimmunol.1101502	Cutting edge: the ""death"" adaptor CRADD/RAIDD targets BCL10 and suppresses agonist-induced cytokine expression in T lymphocytes.	The expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to TCR agonists is regulated by the caspase-recruitment domain membrane-associated guanylate kinase 1 (CARMA1) signalosome through the coordinated assembly of complexes containing the BCL10 adaptor protein. We describe a novel mechanism to negatively regulate the CARMA1 signalosome by the ""death"" adaptor protein caspase and receptor interacting protein adaptor with death domain (CRADD)/receptor interacting protein-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain. We show that CRADD interacts with BCL10 through its caspase recruitment domain and suppresses interactions between BCL10 and CARMA1. TCR agonist-induced interaction between CRADD and BCL10 coincides with reduction of its complex formation with CARMA1 in wild-type, as compared with Cradd-deficient, primary cells. Finally, Cradd-deficient spleen cells, CD4(+) T cells, and mice respond to T cell agonists with strikingly higher production of proinflammatory mediators, including IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-17. These results define a novel role for CRADD as a negative regulator of the CARMA1 signalosome and suppressor of Th1- and Th17-mediated inflammatory responses.	2012	04	19	J Immunol	Lin	Qing
22363141	10.3748/wjg.v18.i7.685	Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and Helicobacter pylori infection: a Colombian perspective.	To assess the significance of chromosome translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21), B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL-10) protein and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in Colombia. Fifty cases of gastric MALT lymphoma and their respective post-treatment follow-up biopsies were examined to assess the presence of the translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) as identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization; to detect protein expression patterns of BCL10 using immunohistochemistry; and for evaluation of tumor histology to determine the correlation of these factors and resistance to H. pylori eradication. Infection with H. pylori was confirmed in all cases of gastric MALT lymphoma in association with chronic gastritis. Bacterial eradication led to tumor regression in 66% of cases. The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) was not present in any of these cases, nor was there evidence of tumor transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thirty-four percent of the patients showed resistance to tumor regression, and within this group, 7 cases, representing 14% of all those analyzed, were considered to be t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive gastric MALT lymphomas. Protein expression of BCL10 in the nucleus was associated with the presence of translocation and treatment resistance. Cases that were considered unresponsive to therapy were histologically characterized by the presence of homogeneous tumor cells and a lack of plasmacytic differentiation. Responder cases exhibited higher cellular heterogeneity and a greater frequency of plasma cells. Both t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphoma cases and those with nuclear BCL10 expression are considered resistant to H. pylori eradication. It is suggested that chronic antigenic stimulation is not a dominant event in resistant cases.	2012	04	11	World J Gastroenterol	Yepes	Sally
22366302	10.1016/j.jmb.2012.02.018	Structural determinants of MALT1 protease activity.	The formation of the CBM (CARD11-BCL10-MALT1) complex is pivotal for antigen-receptor-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Signaling is dependent on MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), which not only acts as a scaffolding protein but also possesses proteolytic activity mediated by its caspase-like domain. It remained unclear how the CBM activates MALT1. Here, we provide biochemical and structural evidence that MALT1 activation is dependent on its dimerization and show that mutations at the dimer interface abrogate activity in cells. The unliganded protease presents itself in a dimeric yet inactive state and undergoes substantial conformational changes upon substrate binding. These structural changes also affect the conformation of the C-terminal Ig-like domain, a domain that is required for MALT1 activity. Binding to the active site is coupled to a relative movement of caspase and Ig-like domains. MALT1 binding partners thus may have the potential of tuning MALT1 protease activity without binding directly to the caspase domain.	2012	07	10	J Mol Biol	Wiesmann	Christian
22382892	10.1038/leu.2012.28	Chlamydia psittaci-negative ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas have biased VH4-34 immunoglobulin gene expression and proliferate in a distinct inflammatory environment.	Ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (OAMZLs) arise in the connective tissues of the orbit or in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the conjunctiva. Here, we present the immunological and genetic analyses of 20 primary Chlamydia psittaci (Cp)-negative OAMZLs. Analysis of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene usage demonstrated a significant preference for V(H)4-34. A combined analysis across all previously published OAMZLs confirmed that this is a general feature of OAMZL, in particular of the Cp-negative group. Our series of OAMZLs did not express the characteristic rheumatoid factor V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements that were previously found in salivary gland- and gastric-marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCLs). We did not detect the MZBCL-specific chromosomal translocations, t(11;18) API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue1) and t(14;18) IgH/MALT1. Two cases contained a premature stop codon in the A20 gene (TNFAIP3) and one case harbored the activating MYD88 hotspot mutation L265P. Variable nuclear expression of BCL10, NFκB1 (p50) and NFκB2 (p52) suggests that other additional genetic abnormalities affecting the NFκB pathway exist within this group of lymphomas. OAMZL showed variable expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and integrin α4β7 by the tumor B cells, and low interferon-γ and interlukin-4 mRNA levels in the tissue, indicative of an inflammatory environment with features in between those previously found in cutaneous and other extranodal MZBCL. The strongly biased usage of V(H)4-34 in Cp-negative OAMZLs suggests involvement of a particular stimulatory (auto-) antigen in their development.	2012	10	09	Leukemia	van Maldegem	F
22407319	10.1038/nature10894	The Shigella flexneri effector OspI deamidates UBC13 to dampen the inflammatory response.	Many bacterial pathogens can enter various host cells and then survive intracellularly, transiently evade humoral immunity, and further disseminate to other cells and tissues. When bacteria enter host cells and replicate intracellularly, the host cells sense the invading bacteria as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by way of various pattern recognition receptors. As a result, the host cells induce alarm signals that activate the innate immune system. Therefore, bacteria must modulate host inflammatory signalling and dampen these alarm signals. How pathogens do this after invading epithelial cells remains unclear, however. Here we show that OspI, a Shigella flexneri effector encoded by ORF169b on the large plasmid and delivered by the type ΙΙΙ secretion system, dampens acute inflammatory responses during bacterial invasion by suppressing the tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated signalling pathway. OspI is a glutamine deamidase that selectively deamidates the glutamine residue at position 100 in UBC13 to a glutamic acid residue. Consequently, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity required for TRAF6 activation is inhibited, allowing S. flexneri OspI to modulate the diacylglycerol-CBM (CARD-BCL10-MALT1) complex-TRAF6-nuclear-factor-κB signalling pathway. We determined the 2.0 Å crystal structure of OspI, which contains a putative cysteine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad. A mutational analysis showed this catalytic triad to be essential for the deamidation of UBC13. Our results suggest that S. flexneri inhibits acute inflammatory responses in the initial stage of infection by targeting the UBC13-TRAF6 complex.	2012	05	08	Nature	Sanada	Takahito
22423967	10.1016/j.chom.2012.01.019	The autophagy regulator Rubicon is a feedback inhibitor of CARD9-mediated host innate immunity.	Assembly of a scaffold consisting of CARD9, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex) is critical for effective signaling by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Dectin and RIG-I. The RUN domain Beclin-1-interacting cysteine-rich-containing Rubicon protein associates constitutively with the Beclin-UVRAG-Vps34 complex under normal conditions to regulate autophagy. Rubicon also interacts with the phagocytic NADPH-oxidase complex upon TLR stimulation to induce potent antimicrobial responses. Here, we show Rubicon is a physiological feedback inhibitor of CBM-mediated PRR signaling, preventing unbalanced proinflammatory responses. Upon Dectin-1- or RIG-I-mediated activation, Rubicon dynamically exchanges binding partners from 14-3-3β to CARD9 in a stimulation-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner, disassembling the CBM signaling complex and ultimately terminating PRR-induced cytokine production. Remarkably, Rubicon's actions in the autophagy complex, phagocytosis complex, and CBM complex are functionally and genetically separable. Rubicon thus differentially targets signaling complexes, depending on environmental stimuli, and may function to coordinate various immune responses against microbial infection.	2012	07	09	Cell Host Microbe	Yang	Chul-Su
22474286	10.1074/jbc.M111.291708	Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a protein activates nuclear factor κB through B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) protein and promotes tumor cell survival in serum deprivation.	FOXO3a, a member of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor family, is believed to be a tumor suppressor because it was found that FOXO3a inactivation promoted cell transformation and tumor progression. There are also a few studies showing that FOXO3a protected cells under stress conditions, including oxidative stress, serum deprivation, and hypoxia. It was reported that FOXO3a promoted invasion of cancer cells. Thus, the role of FOXO3a in cancer is complicated. Here, we report that FOXO3a is a positive regulator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. We found that overexpression of FOXO3a increased and knockdown of FOXO3a repressed NF-κB activities. Mechanistic studies indicate that FOXO3a activated NF-κB via inducing expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10), an upstream regulator of IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB signaling. We found that the serum deprivation activated NF-κB, which was blocked by inhibition of FOXO3a. Knockdown of FOXO3a enhanced cell apoptosis under serum-free conditions, which was inhibited by overexpression of BCL10. These results suggest that FOXO3a promotes cell survival via BCL10/NF-κB in serum starvation. Our findings may add another layer to the complexity of the role of FOXO3a in cancer. Therefore, caution should be taken when FOXO3a is employed as a target for cancer therapy.	2012	07	23	J Biol Chem	Li	Zhaodong
22528498	10.1074/jbc.M111.335463	Protein kinase C-δ negatively regulates T cell receptor-induced NF-κB activation by inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.	T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced T-cell activation is a critical event in adaptive immune responses. The engagement of TCR complex by antigen along with the activation of the costimulatory receptors trigger a cascade of intracellular signaling, in which caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase 1 (CARMA1) is a crucial scaffold protein. Upon stimulation, CARMA1 recruits downstream molecules including B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1), and TRAF6 to assemble a specific TCR-induced signalosome that triggers NF-κB and JNK activation. In this report, we identified protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as a CARMA1-associated protein by a biochemical affinity purification approach. PKCδ interacted with CARMA1 in TCR stimulation-dependent manner in Jurkat T cells. Overexpression of PKCδ inhibited CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas knockdown of PKCδ potentiated TCR-triggered NF-κB activation and IL-2 secretion in Jurkat T cells. Reconstitution experiments with PKCδ kinase-dead mutant indicated that the kinase activity of PKCδ was dispensable for its ability to inhibit TCR-triggered NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we found that PKCδ inhibited the interaction between MALT1 and TRAF6, but not the association of CARMA1 with PKCθ, Bcl10, or MALT1. These observations suggest that PKCδ is a negative regulator in T cell activation through inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.	2012	09	21	J Biol Chem	Liu	Yu
22564715	10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.04.047	Expression of BCL10 in cervical cancer has a role in the regulation of cell growth through the activation of NF-κB-dependent cyclin D1 signaling.	We recently characterized the molecular linkage that directs both BCL10 overexpression and nuclear translocation in response to inflammation-related NF-κB signaling pathway. Since NF-κB activation has been shown to occur in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, we sought to investigate whether BCL10 possesses clinical significance in relation to cervical cancer. Four cervical cancer cell lines (C33A, SiHa, HeLa, and CaSki) were used in this study. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was determined by the luciferase assay. The expression of BCL10, NF-κB, and cyclin D1 in tumor cells from an array of 182 tissue samples was examined using immunohistochemical staining. We transfected four cervical cancer cell lines with BCL10 small interfering RNA (siRNA), and discovered that the down-regulation of BCL10 inhibited the viability of these cervical cancer cells through G1 arrest. BCL10 siRNA treatment inhibited the expression of p-IKKβ and p-IκB, and also down-regulated both NF-κB activation cyclin D1, its downstream cell cycle protein. Our results reveal that cervical cancer had a higher rate of positive cytoplasmic staining (74.1%, 123/166) than either carcinoma in situ (50.0%, 3/6) or normal cervix (0.0%, 0/10); and that poorly differentiated cancer had a higher rate of cytoplasm staining (80.7%, 71/88) than moderately differentiated (75.4%, 43/57) and well differentiated (40%, 4/10) carcinoma. Furthermore, nuclear expression of BCL10 was closely associated with NF-κB activation (p&lt;0.001) and cyclin D1 expression (p&lt;0.001). Our findings indicate that BCL10 plays an important role in controlling the growth of cervical cancer cells through NF-κB dependent cyclin D1 regulation.	2012	11	09	Gynecol Oncol	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
22574776	10.1042/BJ20120414	Protease activity of MALT1: a mystery unravelled.	Constitutive NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) activation in B-cell lymphomas relies greatly on the CARMA1 [CARD (caspase recruitment domain)-containing MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) 1]-Bcl10-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue translocation gene 1) signalling complex. Within this protein complex, MALT1 possesses a rather unique enzymatic activity, which allows it to cleave Bcl10, RelB and CYLD, among other substrates. The catalytic activity of MALT1 promotes activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB as well as other signalling pathways. However, even after a decade of intense research on MALT1, many mechanistic aspects of its enzymatic activity remain elusive.

J. 443, 287-295] provides novel insight into the activation mechanism and the substrate specificity of MALT1. These intriguing findings convincingly demonstrate the importance of MALT1 dimerization for its catalytic activity and pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches that target this crucial regulator of lymphoma survival and proliferation.	2012	07	13	Biochem J	Kirchhofer	Daniel
22579587	10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.05.001	Prolongation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in human colonic epithelial cells by activation of an NFκB-BCL10 loop.	Carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide that is widely used as a food additive, induces inflammatory responses in animal models and human cells. The carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascades involve toll-like receptor (TLR)4- and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)10-dependent activation of NF-κB, leading to increased IL-8 production. Translocations involving BCL10 in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are associated with constitutive activation of NF-κB. This report presents a mechanism by which carrageenan exposure leads to prolonged activation of both BCL10 and NF-κB in human colonic epithelial cells. Study findings demonstrate that nuclear RelA and RelB bind to an NF-κB binding motif in the BCL10 promoter in human colonic epithelial NCM460 and HT-29 cells. In vitro oligonucleotide binding assay, non-radioactive gel shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) indicate binding of RelA and RelB to the BCL10 promoter. Prolonged inflammation follows activation of the BCL10-NFκB inflammatory loop in response to carrageenan, shown by increased BCL10, RelA, and IL-8 for 36 to 48h and increased RelB for 24h following withdrawal of carrageenan after 12h. In contrast, exposure to dextran sulfate sodium, which does not cause inflammation through TLR4 and BCL10 in the colonic epithelial cells, did not provoke prolonged activation of inflammation. The carrageenan-enhanced BCL10 promoter activity was blocked by caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and MB-132 which inhibit NF-κB activation. These results indicate that NF-κB binding to the BCL10 promoter can lead to prolonged activation of the carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascade by a transcriptional mechanism involving an NF-κB-BCL10 loop.	2013	01	18	Biochim Biophys Acta	Borthakur	Alip
22658522	10.1016/j.immuni.2012.04.008	Selective autophagy of the adaptor protein Bcl10 modulates T cell receptor activation of NF-κB.	The adaptor protein Bcl10 is a critically important mediator of T cell receptor (TCR)-to-NF-κB signaling. Bcl10 degradation is a poorly understood biological phenomenon suggested to reduce TCR activation of NF-κB. Here we have shown that TCR engagement triggers the degradation of Bcl10 in primary effector T cells but not in naive T cells. TCR engagement promoted K63 polyubiquitination of Bcl10, causing Bcl10 association with the autophagy adaptor p62. Paradoxically, p62 binding was required for both Bcl10 signaling to NF-κB and gradual degradation of Bcl10 by autophagy. Bcl10 autophagy was highly selective, as shown by the fact that it spared Malt1, a direct Bcl10 binding partner. Blockade of Bcl10 autophagy enhanced TCR activation of NF-κB. Together, these data demonstrate that selective autophagy of Bcl10 is a pathway-intrinsic homeostatic mechanism that modulates TCR signaling to NF-κB in effector T cells. This homeostatic process may protect T cells from adverse consequences of unrestrained NF-κB activation, such as cellular senescence.	2012	09	13	Immunity	Paul	Suman
22708078	10.1016/j.celrep.2012.04.006	Bcl10 links saturated fat overnutrition with hepatocellular NF-kB activation and insulin resistance.	Excess serum free fatty acids (FFAs) are fundamental to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. With high-fat feeding, FFAs activate NF-kB in target tissues, initiating negative crosstalk with insulin signaling. However, the mechanisms underlying FFA-dependent NF-kB activation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the saturated FA, palmitate, requires Bcl10 for NF-kB activation in hepatocytes. Uptake of palmitate, metabolism to diacylglycerol, and subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) appear to mechanistically link palmitate with Bcl10, known as a central component of a signaling complex that, along with CARMA3 and MALT1, activates NF-kB downstream of selected cell surface receptors. Consequently, Bcl10-deficient mice are protected from hepatic NF-kB activation and insulin resistance following brief high-fat diet, suggesting that Bcl10 plays a major role in the metabolic consequences of acute overnutrition. Surprisingly, while CARMA3 also participates in the palmitate response, MALT1 is completely dispensable, thereby revealing an apparent nonclassical role for Bcl10 in NF-kB signaling.	2013	04	17	Cell Rep	Van Beek	Matthew
22734454	10.3109/10520295.2012.695025	BCL10 expression is unrelated to clinico-pathological parameters or prognoses for oral squamous cell carcinomas.	BCL-10 (B-cell lymphoma 10) has been linked to a pro-apoptotic gene in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. We describe the expression of BCL10 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its relation to clinical, pathological and prognostic parameters. We carried out a retrospective study of 50 patients in Spain who were diagnosed with OSCC. We constructed a tissue microarray of the samples to study the expression of BCL10 using immunohistochemistry. Diffuse and homogeneous staining was observed in the nuclei and cytoplasms of most neoplastic cells of the vast majority of tumors and no significant differences were seen in different areas of the tumors. The expression was unrelated to any clinical or pathological parameters including tumor stage. The intra-class coefficient was 0.97, which indicates the minimal variability among the determinations.	2012	11	23	Biotech Histochem	Moar-Antelo	A R
22812606	10.1021/pr3000464	Role-shifting PKCζ fosters its own proapoptotic destruction by complexing with Bcl10 at the nuclear envelope of human cervical carcinoma cells: a proteomic and biochemical study.	Many features of deadly human cervical cancers (HCCs) still require elucidation. Among HCC-derived cell lines, here we used the C4-I one since its quantitative gene expression pattern most closely mimics invasive HCCs, including protein kinase-Cζ (PKCζ) overexpression. Via proteomic, bioinformatic, and biochemical approaches we identified 31 and 33 proteins co-immunoprecipitating with PKCζ from nuclear membranes (NMs) of, respectively, untreated or VP-16-exposed C4-I cells. Such proteins belonged to eight functional groups, whose compositions and relative sizes changed with either context. Of the 56 proteins identified, only eight were shared between the two subproteomes, including Bcl10. Surprisingly, proteins known to associate with Bcl10, like Carma1/3 and Malt1, in so-called CBM signalosomes were absent. Notably, in VP-16-treated C4-I cells, PKCζ•Bcl10 complexes increasingly accrued at NMs, where PKCζ phosphorylated Bcl10, as PKCζ also did in vitro and in cell-free systems, both processes being thwarted by interfering RNA (iRNA) PKCζ depletion. Caspase-3 was associated with PKCζ•Bcl10 complexes and proteolyzed PKCζ leading to its inactivation/destruction; both events were prevented by Bcl10 iRNA suppression. Thus, PKCζ's molecular interactions and functional roles changed strikingly according to the untreated or apoptogen-treated cells context, and by complexing with Bcl10, PKCζ surprisingly favored its own demise, which suggests both proteins as HCCs therapeutic targets.	2012	12	05	J Proteome Res	Chiarini	Anna
22818167	10.1016/j.humpath.2012.03.024	BCL10 down-regulation in peripheral T-cell lymphomas.	The BCL10 gene encodes for a T-cell receptor signaling downstream protein involved in nuclear factor κB activation. It is expressed in normal lymphoid tissues and in several B-non Hodgkin lymphomas, its aberrant function being related to the pathogenesis of certain subtypes. Conversely, conflicting data are available concerning BCL10 expression in peripheral T cell lymphomas. We analyzed BCL10 expression in peripheral T cell lymphomas and correlated it with NFκB activation, proliferation, phenotypic aberration, and survival. First, gene expression analysis of 40 peripheral T cell lymphomas (28 peripheral T cell lymphomas/not otherwise specified, 6 anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and 6 angioimmunoblastic lymphomas), 4 reactive lymph nodes, and 20 samples of normal T-lymphocytes, showed significantly lower BCL10 gene expression in all tumors in comparison to normal samples, the lowest values being detected in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Secondly, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of BCL10 in 52 peripheral T cell lymphomas/not otherwise specified on tissue microarrays. BCL10 was expressed in 10/52 cases (19%), not showing any significant correlation with either expression of Ki-67 and the T-cell markers or NFκB activation. Furthermore, BCL10 expression was not associated with peculiar gene expression profiles. Finally, we did not find significant correlations with progression free survival and overall survival, although a favorable trend was recorded in BCL10(+) cases. In conclusion, BCL10 was commonly down-regulated in peripheral T cell lymphomas, suggest the T-cell receptor signaling cascade for future characterization.	2013	02	05	Hum Pathol	Rossi	Maura
22842723	10.3892/or.2012.1942	Breast MALT lymphomas: a clinicopathological and cytogenetic study of 9 cases.	Primary breast mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are uncommon and restricted diagnostic criteria should be used to exclude breast involvement by systemic lymphomas. The molecular pathogenesis of primary breast MALT lymphomas is not clear because of the rarity of the disease. Generally the molecular studies of MALT lymphoma in extranodal sites have shown the presence of different chromosomal aberrations, mutually exclusive with substantial differences in their frequency relatively to topographic localization. Few cases of breast MALT lymphomas in the literature have been assessed for MALT lymphoma-associated translocations and BCL10 expression, underlying their rarity in primary breast MALT lymphomas. In our study, we analyzed a series of nine cases of primary breast MALT lymphomas. FISH results showed evidence of MALT1 gene rearrangements in four primary breast lymphomas, in particular three cases with t(11;18)(q21;q21) and one case with t(14;18)(q32;q21). In addition, BCL10 gene rearrangement was not observed. There was no evidence of BCL10 gene translocation in any of the neoplasms assessed. Our data indicate that MALT1 gene rearrangements are not rare in primary breast MALT lymphoma in contrast with results of previous series. Finally, t(11;18) has been observed to be significantly associated with high intensity cytoplasmic BCL10 expression underlying cross-talk between MALT1 and BCL10 pathways in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas.	2013	05	09	Oncol Rep	Liguori	Giuseppina
22880103	10.1371/journal.pone.0042775	Structural insights into the assembly of CARMA1 and BCL10.	The CBM complex (CARMA1, BCL10 and MALT1) plays a crucial role in B and T lymphocyte activation. CARMA1 serves as a scaffold for BCL10, MALT1 and other effector proteins and regulates various signaling pathways related to the immune response. The assembly of CARMA1 and BCL10 is mediated through a CARD-CARD interaction. Here, we report the crystal structure of the CARD domain of CARMA1 at a resolution of 1.75 Å. The structure consists of six helices, as previously determined for CARD domains. Structural and computational analysis identified the binding interface between CARMA1-CARD and BCL10-CARD, which consists of a basic patch in CARMA1 and an acidic patch in BCL10. Site-directed mutagenesis, co-immunoprecipitation and an NF-κB activation assay confirmed that the interface is necessary for association and downstream signaling. Our studies provide molecular insight into the assembly of CARMA1 and BCL10.	2013	01	10	PLoS One	Li	Siwei
23035874	10.1186/1423-0127-19-85	BCL10GFP fusion protein as a substrate for analysis of determinants required for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1)-mediated cleavage.	MALT1 belongs to a family of paracaspase and modulates NF-κB signaling pathways through its scaffolding function and proteolytic activity. MALT1 cleaves protein substrates after a positively charged Arginine residue. BCL10, a 233 amino acids polypeptide, is identified as one of the MALT1 proteolytic substrates. MALT1 cleaves BCL10 at the C-terminal end of Arg228. A mere 5 amino acids difference between the substrate and the proteolytic product made it difficult to tell whether the cleavage event took place by using a simple western blot analysis. Here, BCL10GFP was constructed and utilized to examine the specificity and domain determinants for MALT1 cleavage in cells. Various BCL10GFP constructs were transfected into HEK293T cell with MALT1 construct by using calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method. Lysates of transfectants were resolved by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by western blot analysis. BCL10GFP was proteolytically processed by MALT1 as BCL10. The integrity of caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and MALT1-interacting domain on BCL10 were required for MALT1 proteolytic activity. Besides the invariant P1 cleavage site Arg228, P4 Leu225 played a role in defining BCL10 as a good substrate for MALT1. We offered a way of monitoring the catalytic activity of MALT1 in HEK293T cells using BCL10GFP as a substrate. BCL10GFP can be utilized as a convenient tool for studying the determinants for efficient MALT1 cleavage in HEK293T cells.	2013	04	03	J Biomed Sci	Jou	Shin-Yi
23087406	10.4049/jimmunol.1102952	Critical role of B cell lymphoma 10 in BAFF-regulated NF-κB activation and survival of anergic B cells.	Anergy is a key physiological mechanism for restraining self-reactive B cells. A marked portion of peripheral B cells are anergic B cells that largely depend on BAFF for survival. BAFF activates the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, both of which are required for B cell survival. In this study we report that deficiency of the adaptor protein B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) impaired the ability of BAFF to support B cell survival in vitro, and it specifically increased apoptosis in anergic B cells in vivo, dramatically reducing anergic B cells in mice. Bcl10-dependent survival of self-reactive anergic B cells was confirmed in the Ig hen egg lysozyme/soluble hen egg lysozyme double-transgenic mouse model of B cell anergy. Furthermore, we found that BAFF stimulation induced Bcl10 association with IκB kinase β, a key component of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Consistently, Bcl10-deficient B cells were impaired in BAFF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and formation of nuclear p50/c-Rel complexes. Bcl10-deficient B cells also displayed reduced expression of NF-κB2/p100, severely reducing BAFF-induced nuclear accumulation of noncanonical p52/RelB complexes. Consequently, Bcl10-deficient B cells failed to express Bcl-x(L), a BAFF-induced NF-κB target gene. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bcl10 controls BAFF-induced canonical NF-κB activation directly and noncanonical NF-κB activation indirectly. The BAFF-R/Bcl10/NF-κB signaling axis plays a critical role in peripheral B cell tolerance by regulating the survival of self-reactive anergic B cells.	2013	01	18	J Immunol	Yu	Mei
23153494	10.1016/j.devcel.2012.09.021	The NF-κB signaling protein Bcl10 regulates actin dynamics by controlling AP1 and OCRL-bearing vesicles.	The protein Bcl10 contributes to adaptive and innate immunity through the assembly of a signaling complex that plays a key role in antigen receptor and FcR-induced NF-κB activation. Here we demonstrate that Bcl10 has an NF-κB-independent role in actin and membrane remodeling downstream of FcR in human macrophages. Depletion of Bcl10 impaired Rac1 and PI3K activation and led to an abortive phagocytic cup rich in PI(4,5)P(2), Cdc42, and F-actin, which could be rescued with low doses of F-actin depolymerizing drugs. Unexpectedly, we found Bcl10 in a complex with the clathrin adaptors AP1 and EpsinR. In particular, Bcl10 was required to locally deliver the vesicular OCRL phosphatase that regulates PI(4,5)P(2) and F-actin turnover, both crucial for the completion of phagosome closure. Thus, we identify Bcl10 as an early coordinator of NF-κB-mediated immune response with endosomal trafficking and signaling to F-actin remodeling.	2013	01	31	Dev Cell	Marion	Sabrina

20830719	10.1002/ijc.25663	BCL6 gene rearrangement and protein expression are associated with large cell presentation of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.	Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) is an indolent B-cell lymphoma, which is often localized in the stomach. It is characterized by typical morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and expression profile. The coexistence of a large B-cell lymphoma and a MALT lymphoma in the gastrointestinal tract is defined as a composite lymphoma (ComL) and, as we have previously shown, is almost always the consequence of secondary transformation of MALT lymphoma. Here, we have analyzed a panel of seven MALT lymphomas, seven ComL and thirteen large cell variants of marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBL) using FISH for the detection of rearrangements of IGH, MALT1, BCL6, BCL10 and FOXP1 and immunohistochemistry for Bcl6, Bcl10 and FoxP1. Translocations involving IGH were found in 10/27 lymphomas including two cases with IGH-BCL6 fusion and one with IGH-BCL10 fusion; in 7/10 cases, the translocation partner was not identified. Bcl10 and FoxP1 protein expression was heterogeneous throughout the series. Genetic rearrangements of BCL6 and Bcl6 protein expression were found almost exclusively in the large cell components of the ComL and the large cell extranodal MZBL (p = 0.2093 and p = 0.0261, respectively). These findings suggest Bcl6 as a marker for transformation of MALT lymphoma.	2011	07	04	Int J Cancer	Flossbach	Lucia
21187856	10.1038/cr.2010.182	NF-κB signaling pathways regulated by CARMA family of scaffold proteins.	The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in cell activation, survival and proliferation. Its aberrant activity results in cancer, immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorders. Over the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the signals that regulate NF-κB activation, especially how scaffold proteins link different receptors to the NF-κB-activating complex, the IκB kinase complex. The growing number of these scaffolds underscores the complexity of the signaling networks in different cell types. In this review, we discuss the role of scaffold molecules in signaling cascades induced by stimulation of antigen receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors and C-type Lectin receptors, resulting in NF-κB activation. Especially, we focus on the family of Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins known as CARMA and their function in activation of NF-κB, as well as the link of these scaffolds to the development of various neoplastic diseases through regulation of NF-κB.	2011	04	12	Cell Res	Blonska	Marzenna
21199863	10.1074/jbc.M110.155895	The Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin controls the formation of the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex during T cell receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation.	T cell receptor (TCR) ligation induces increased diacylglycerol and Ca(2+) levels in T cells, and both secondary messengers are crucial for TCR-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and NF-κB signaling pathways. One prominent calcium-dependent enzyme involved in the regulation of NF-AT and NF-κB signaling pathways is the protein phosphatase calcineurin. However, in contrast to NF-AT, which is directly dephosphorylated by calcineurin, the molecular basis of the calcium-calcineurin dependence of the TCR-induced NF-κB activity remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that calcineurin regulates TCR-induced NF-κB activity by controlling the formation of a protein complex composed of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1 (CBM complex). For instance, increased calcium levels induced by ionomycin or thapsigargin augmented the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced formation of the CBM complex and activation of NF-κB, whereas removal of calcium by the calcium chelator EGTA-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) attenuated both processes. Furthermore, inhibition of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CsA) or FK506 as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of calcineurin A strongly affected the PMA + ionomycin- or anti-CD3 + CD28-induced CBM complex assembly. Mechanistically, the positive effect of calcineurin on the CBM complex formation seems to be linked to a dephosphorylation of Bcl10. For instance, Bcl10 was found to be hyperphosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon treatment with CsA or EGTA-AM, and calcineurin dephosphorylated Bcl10 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we show here that calcineurin A interacts with the CBM complex. In summary, the evidence provided here argues for a previously unanticipated role of calcineurin in CBM complex formation as a molecular basis of the inhibitory function of CsA or FK506 on TCR-induced NF-κB activity.	2011	05	04	J Biol Chem	Palkowitsch	Lysann
21261681	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03699.x	MALT lymphoma: many roads lead to nuclear factor-κb activation.	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is characterized genetically by several recurrent, but mutually exclusive, chromosome translocations. To date, it has been shown that at least the oncogenic products of t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, t(14;18)(q32;21)/IGH-MALT1 and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1 activate the nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation pathway. Recently, A20, an essential global NF-κB inhibitor, was found to be inactivated by somatic deletion and/or mutation in translocation-negative MALT lymphomas. However, these genetic abnormalities alone are not sufficient for malignant transformation and thus need to cooperate with other factors in MALT lymphomagenesis. Recent studies have shown steady, exciting progresses in our understanding of the biological functions of BCL10, MALT1 and A20 in the regulation of the NF-κB activation pathways and the biology of lymphocytes. This review discusses the implication of these recent advances in the molecular pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma, and explores how the above genetic abnormalities cooperate with immunological stimulation in the development of lymphoma.	2011	08	19	Histopathology	Du	Ming-Qing
21283787	10.1371/journal.ppat.1001259	Selective C-Rel activation via Malt1 controls anti-fungal T(H)-17 immunity by dectin-1 and dectin-2.	C-type lectins dectin-1 and dectin-2 on dendritic cells elicit protective immunity against fungal infections through induction of T(H)1 and T(H)-17 cellular responses. Fungal recognition by dectin-1 on human dendritic cells engages the CARD9-Bcl10-Malt1 module to activate NF-κB. Here we demonstrate that Malt1 recruitment is pivotal to T(H)-17 immunity by selective activation of NF-κB subunit c-Rel, which induces expression of T(H)-17-polarizing cytokines IL-1β and IL-23p19. Malt1 inhibition abrogates c-Rel activation and T(H)-17 immunity to Candida species. We found that Malt1-mediated activation of c-Rel is similarly essential to induction of T(H)-17-polarizing cytokines by dectin-2. Whereas dectin-1 activates all NF-κB subunits, dectin-2 selectively activates c-Rel, signifying a specialized T(H)-17-enhancing function for dectin-2 in anti-fungal immunity by human dendritic cells. Thus, dectin-1 and dectin-2 control adaptive T(H)-17 immunity to fungi via Malt1-dependent activation of c-Rel.	2011	05	05	PLoS Pathog	Gringhuis	Sonja I
21396111	10.1186/1478-811X-9-6	B cell antigen receptor-induced activation of an IRAK4-dependent signaling pathway revealed by a MALT1-IRAK4 double knockout mouse model.	The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and pathogen recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), act in concert to control adaptive B cell responses. However, little is known about the signaling pathways that integrate BCR activation with intrinsic TLR4 stimulation. Antigen receptors initialize activation of the inducible transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) via recruitment of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase caspase recruitment domain protein 11 (CARD11), the adapter molecule B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), and the ""paracaspase"" mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) into lipid rafts. Upon BCR triggering, this activation strictly depends on BCL10, but not on MALT1, leading to the hypothesis that a MALT1-independent NF-κB activation pathway contributes to BCR-induced NF-κB activation downstream of BCL10. The identity of this pathway has remained elusive. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that the IRAK4- and IRAK1-dependent TLR signaling branch is activated upon BCR triggering to induce partial NF-κB activation. BCR-induced MALT1-independent IκB degradation and B cell proliferation were inhibited in MALT1/IRAK4 double knockout B cells. Moreover, IRAK1 was recruited into lipid rafts upon BCR stimulation and activated following transient recruitment of IRAK4. We propose that the observed crosstalk between BCR and TLR signaling components may contribute to the discrimination of signals that emanate from single and dual receptor engagement to control adaptive B cell responses.	2011	07	14	Cell Commun Signal	Dufner	Almut
21406399	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3626	CARMA3 is crucial for EGFR-Induced activation of NF-κB and tumor progression.	EGF activates NF-κB, and constitutively activated NF-κB contributes to EGFR mutation-associated tumorigenesis, but it remains unclear precisely how EGFR signaling leads to NF-κB activation. Here we report that CARMA3, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing scaffold molecule, is required for EGF-induced NF-κB activation. CARMA3 deficiency impaired the activation of the IKK complex following EGF stimulation, resulting in a defect of EGF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. We found that CARMA3 and Bcl10 contributed to several characteristics of EGFR-associated malignancy, including proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. Most importantly, CARMA3 contributed to tumor growth in vivo. Our findings elucidate a crucial link between EGFR-proximal signaling components and the downstream IKK complex, and they suggest a new therapeutic target for treatment of EGFR-driven cancers.	2011	07	25	Cancer Res	Jiang	Tang
21489413	10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.03.025	CD4 ligation excludes the Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex from GM1-positive membrane rafts in CD3/CD28 activated T cells.	The antibody 13B8.2, which is directed against the CDR3-like loop on the D1 domain of CD4, induces CD4/ZAP-70 reorganization and ceramide release in membrane rafts. Here, we investigated whether CD4/ZAP-70 compartmentalization could be mediated by an effect of 13B8.2 on the Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex in membrane rafts. We report that treatment of CD3/CD28-activated Jurkat T cells with 13B8.2, but not rituximab, excluded Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 proteins from GM1(+) membrane rafts and concomitantly decreased NF-κB activation. Fluorescence confocal imaging confirmed that Carma1-Bcl10 and Carma1-MALT1 co-patching, observed in GM1(+) membrane rafts following CD3/CD28 activation, were abrogated after a 24h-treatment with 13B8.2. The CD4/ZAP-70 compartmentalization in membrane rafts induced by 13B8.2 is thus related to Carma1-Bcl10-MALT1 raft exclusion.	2011	10	04	Cell Immunol	Rigo	Maxime
21513986	10.1016/j.molimm.2011.03.020	CaMKII targets Bcl10 in T-cell receptor induced activation of NF-κB.	Recognition of antigen by T- or B-cell receptors leads to formation of an immunological synapse and initiation of signalling events that collaborate to determine the nature of the adaptive immune response. Activation of NF-κB transcription factors has a key role in regulation of numerous genes with important functions in immune responses and inflammation and is of great importance for lymphocyte activation and differentiation. The activation of NF-κB depends on changes in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and both calmodulin (CaM) and a CaM-dependent kinase, CaMKII, help regulate NF-κB activation after T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, but the mechanisms are not well characterized. Here we have analyzed the functional role of CaMKII in the signalling pathway from the TCR to activation of IKK, the kinase that phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB. We show that CaMKII is recruited to the immunological synapse where it interacts with and phosphorylates the signalling adaptor protein Bcl10. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the CARD domain of Bcl10 by CaMKII regulates the interactions within the important Carma1, Bcl10, Malt1 signalling complex and the essential signal induced ubiquitinations of Bcl10 and IKKγ. We propose a novel mechanism whereby Ca(2+) signals can be integrated at the immunological synapse through CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl10.	2011	08	10	Mol Immunol	Oruganti	Sreenivasa Rao
21674474	10.1002/eji.201041052	Dephosphorylation of Bcl-10 by calcineurin is essential for canonical NF-κB activation in Th cells.	Antigen-specific stimulation of T helper (Th) cells initiates signaling cascades that ultimately result in the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1 which regulate, together with other factors, many T-cell functions such as cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation. Ordered assembly and different phosphorylation events, along with subcellular translocation of the CARMA1/Bcl-10/MALT1 complex, determine NF-κB activation after T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering. We now provide evidence that inhibition of the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) prevents dephosphorylation of Bcl-10. CaN, in constant interaction with the Bcl-10/MALT1 complex, is able to dephosphorylate Bcl-10. The CaN inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) converts a transient phosphorylation of Bcl-10 Ser138 during the immediate early phase of T-cell activation into a persistent state. Thus, subsequent processes such as IKKβ phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and DNA binding are diminished. Consistently, CsA treatment does not affect the phosphorylation pattern of the upstream kinase PKCθ. Together, our findings demonstrate that CaN functions as a critical signaling molecule during Th cell activation, regulating Bcl-10 phosphorylation and thereby NF-κB activation.	2011	10	03	Eur J Immunol	Frischbutter	Stefan
21700900	10.1152/ajpgi.00071.2011	Specific effects of BCL10 Serine mutations on phosphorylations in canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation following carrageenan.	To determine the impact of B cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL) 10 on the phosphorylation of crucial mediators in NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways, human colonic epithelial cells were exposed to carrageenan (CGN), a sulfated polysaccharide commonly used as a food additive and known to induce NF-κB nuclear translocation by both canonical and noncanonical pathways. Phosphorylations of intermediates in inflammatory cascades, including NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) at Thr(559), transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase (TAK) 1 at Thr(184), Thr(187), and Ser(192), and inhibitory factor κBα (IκBα) at Ser(32), were examined following mutation of BCL10 at Ser(138) and at Ser(218). Specific phosphoantibodies were used for detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy of differences in phosphorylation following transfection by mutated BCL10. Both mutations demonstrated dominant-negative effects, with inhibition of phospho(Ser(32))-IκBα to less than control levels. Both of the BCL10 mutations reduced the CGN-induced increases in nuclear RelA and p50, but only the Ser(138) mutation inhibited the CGN-induced increases in nuclear RelB and p52 and in NIK Thr(559) phosphorylation. Hence, the phosphorylation of BCL10 Ser(138), but not Ser(218), emerged as a critical event in activation of the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation. Either BCL10 Ser(138) or Ser(218) mutation inhibited the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr(184) and at Thr(187), but not at Ser(192). These findings indicate that BCL10 phosphorylations act upstream of phosphorylations of NIK, TAK1, and IκBα and differentially affect the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation.	2011	10	20	Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
21745165	10.3109/10428194.2011.596968	Thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue: a clinicopathological and genetic analysis of six cases.	We investigated six new cases of primary thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) to further characterize the clinicopathological and genetic features. The male to female ratio was 1:1. One female patient had suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus. Another female patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis after thymectomy. One patient had a concurrent tumor in the eyelid. Radiologically, all tumors were located in the prevascular space and presented as asymmetric heterogeneously enhanced cystic and solid masses. MALT1, BCL10 or IGH translocations and trisomy 18 were not observed in any cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Trisomy 3 was detected in one patient and another showed a TNFAIP3/A20 deletion. Meta-analysis (n = 51) including the present and previously reported cases revealed that the prevalence of autoimmunity was much lower in males with thymic MALT lymphoma compared to females (33% vs. 87%, p = 0.001). Additionally, the average age of females or patients with autoimmunity was about 10 years younger than that of males or patients without autoimmunity (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008, respectively). In summary, thymic MALT lymphoma arising without underlying autoimmunity frequently involves males or older patients. Trisomy 3 and an A20 deletion might play a role in the pathogenesis of thymic MALT lymphoma.	2012	07	13	Leuk Lymphoma	Go	Heounjeong
21750409	10.4161/cc.10.15.16923	From MALT lymphoma to the CBM signalosome: three decades of discovery.	The advent of molecular cytogenetics has led to the elucidation of genetic abnormalities that cause various congenital and oncological disorders. In B cell lymphoma, for example, a number of chromosomal translocations have been identified in and associated with the etiology of specific subtypes of lymphoma. Several recurrent chromosomal translocations have been identified in extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). Cloning and characterization of the products of three mutually exclusive translocation breakpoints found in MALT lymphoma led to the discovery of a novel NF-κB-activating complex comprising the CARMA, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins. This ""CBM signalosome"" acts downstream of the antigen receptors in lymphocytes as well as a number of non-lymphoid cell-surface receptors involved in a variety of biological processes. CBM signalosome activity is important for normal cellular functions and is perturbed in neoplastic and inflammatory disorders, making it a viable target for novel therapeutic design.	2011	12	13	Cell Cycle	Rosebeck	Shaun
21837708	10.1002/gcc.20910	Establishment of a novel MALT lymphoma cell line, ma-1, from a patient with t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive Helicobacter pylori-independent gastric MALT lymphoma.	Although t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and a few other genetic mutations are specific markers for the Helicobacter pylori (HP)-independent status of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the molecular mechanisms responsible for HP-independence of gastric MALT lymphoma without such translocations and mutations remain uncharacterized. In the present study, we describe the establishment and characterization of a novel MALT lymphoma cell line, MA-1, which was derived from a gastric MALT lymphoma which was negative for both t(11;18)(q21;q21) and t(1;14)(p22;q32); the patient had failed HP eradication therapy and chemotherapy. The cell morphology and the immunophenotype of this cell line were similar to that of the original gastric MALT lymphoma. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed no significant gene copy number changes. Spectral karyotyping displayed a near-diploid chromosome content (48 &lt; 2n&gt;XY), with at least 13 chromosome structural abnormalities. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses disclosed the existence of three sub-clones, characterized by t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2, t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, and the presence of both chromosomal translocations in the same cell, respectively; whereas amplification of the genes CRAD9, TRAF2, and BCL10 were not found. In conclusion, we have established the first human gastric MALT lymphoma cell line, which is characterized by unusual and complex chromosome translocations and will be useful to explore further the molecular mechanisms of HP-independence in gastric MALT lymphoma.	2012	03	15	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	Kuo	Sung-Hsin
21862580	10.1074/jbc.M111.259549	Akt fine-tunes NF-κB-dependent gene expression during T cell activation.	Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway is critical for leukocyte activation and development. Although previous studies suggested a role for the Akt kinase in coupling the T cell antigen receptor and CD28 to NF-κB activation in T cells, the nature of the role of Akt in this pathway is still unclear. Using a targeted gene profiling approach, we found that a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes required Akt for optimal up-regulation during T cell activation. The selective effects of Akt were manifest at the level of mRNA transcription and p65/RelA binding to upstream promoters and appear to be due to altered formation of the Carma1-Bcl10 complex. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α was found to be particularly sensitive to Akt inhibition or knockdown, including in primary human blood T cells and a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings are consistent with a hierarchy in the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, controlled by the strength and/or duration of NF-κB signaling. More broadly, our results suggest that defining the more graded effects of signaling, such as those demonstrated here for Akt and the NF-κB pathway, is important to understanding how cells can fine-tune signaling responses for optimal sensitivity and specificity.	2011	12	12	J Biol Chem	Cheng	Jing
21896478	10.1074/jbc.M111.263384	The E3 ubiquitin ligase mind bomb-2 (MIB2) protein controls B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-dependent NF-κB activation.	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) is crucial for the activation of NF-κB in numerous immune receptor signaling pathways, including the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to signal transduction from BCL10 to downstream NF-κB effector kinases, such as TAK1 and components of the IKK complex, are not entirely understood. Here we used a proteomic approach and identified the E3 ligase MIB2 as a novel component of the activated BCL10 complex. In vitro translation and pulldown assays suggest direct interaction between BCL10 and MIB2. Overexpression experiments show that MIB2 controls BCL10-mediated activation of NF-κB by promoting autoubiquitination and ubiquitination of IKKγ/NEMO, as well as recruitment and activation of TAK1. Knockdown of MIB2 inhibited BCL10-dependent NF-κB activation. Together, our results identify MIB2 as a novel component of the activated BCL10 signaling complex and a missing link in the BCL10-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway.	2011	12	15	J Biol Chem	Stempin	Cinthia C
22158899	10.1073/pnas.1111708108	Crystal structure of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) paracaspase region.	The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) paracaspase, a key component of the Carma1/Bcl10/MALT1 signalosome, is critical for NF-κB signaling in multiple contexts. MALT1 is thought to function as a scaffold and protease to promote signaling; however, the biochemical and structural basis of paracaspase action remains largely unknown. Here we report the 1.75-Å resolution crystal structure of the MALT1 paracaspase region, which contains the paracaspase domain and an ensuing Ig-like domain. The paracaspase and the Ig domains appear as a single folding unit and interact with each other through extensive van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. The paracaspase domain adopts a fold that is nearly identical to that of classic caspases and homodimerizes similarly to form an active protease. Unlike caspases, the active and mature form of the paracaspase domain remains a single uncleaved polypeptide and specifically recognizes the bound peptide inhibitor Val-Arg-Pro-Arg. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid Arg of the inhibitor is coordinated by three highly conserved acidic residues. This structure serves as an important framework for deciphering the function and mechanism of paracaspases exemplified by MALT1.	2012	02	21	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Yu	Jong W
19714753	10.1002/ibd.21092	Platelet-activating factor-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells are Bcl10-dependent.	Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory phospholipid mediator, has been implicated in inducing intestinal inflammation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, its mechanisms of inducing inflammatory responses are not fully understood. Therefore, studies were designed to explore the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammatory cascade in intestinal epithelial cells. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was measured by luciferase assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) production was determined by ELISA. B-cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 3 (CARMA3), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) mRNA and protein levels were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. siRNA silencing of Bcl10 was used to examine its role in PAF-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production. The promoter region of the Bcl10 gene was cloned with the PCR method and promoter activity measured by luciferase assay. The adaptor protein Bcl10 appeared to play an important role in the PAF-induced inflammatory pathway in human intestinal epithelial cells. Bcl10 was required for PAF-induced I kappaB alpha phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and IL-8 production in NCM460, a cell line derived from normal human colon, and Caco-2, a transformed human intestinal cell line. PAF also stimulated Bcl10 interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1, and upregulated Bcl10 expression in these cells via transcriptional regulation. These findings highlight a novel PAF-induced inflammatory pathway in intestinal epithelial cells, requiring Bcl10 as a critical mediator and involving CARMA3/Bcl10/MALT1 interactions. The proinflammatory effects of PAF play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of IBD and this pathway may present important targets for intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine.	2010	07	27	Inflamm Bowel Dis	Borthakur	Alip
19864123	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.07.002	Carrageenan-induced innate immune response is modified by enzymes that hydrolyze distinct galactosidic bonds.	The common food additive carrageenan (CGN) predictably induces intestinal inflammation in animal models. Mechanisms of CGN-induced nuclear factor κB and interleukin-8 (IL-8) stimulation include an immune-mediated pathway involving toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated pathway. To determine how the structure of CGN contributes to its initiation of inflammation through these two distinct mechanisms, we treated CGNs with galactosidases and carrageenases (CGNases) and determined the impact on IL-8 secretion and BCL10 production. Hydrolysis of CGN by the enzyme α-1→(3,6)-galactosidase significantly reduced increases in IL-8 and BCL10, but other galactosidases tested, including α-1→6-galactosidase, β-1→4-galactosidase and β-1→3,6-galactosidase, had no effect. In contrast, specific κ-CGNases or ι-CGNases, which hydrolyze β-1,4-galactosidic bonds, produced increases in IL-8 and BCL10 attributable to increased exposure of the immunogenic α-1→3-galactosidic epitope of CGN to TLR4. These results were consistent with induction of innate immune response by an interaction of TLR4 with the unusual α-d-Gal-(1→3)-d-Gal epitope present in CGN. Activation of the ROS-mediated pathway was unaffected by treatment of κ-CGN with either κ-CGNase (3 mg/L), α-1→(3,6)-galactosidase (20 mU/ml) or these enzymes in combination, indicating that changes in IL-8 production were attributable to the effects of induction of inflammation on the TLR4-BCL10-mediated innate immune pathway. These findings provide new information about the specificity of carbohydrate-protein interaction between CGN and TLR4 and may help to devise treatments that modify the immune reactivity induced by carbohydrate antigens.	2011	01	28	J Nutr Biochem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
19897484	10.1074/jbc.M109.050815	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) is required for NF-kappaB production by both canonical and noncanonical pathways and for NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) phosphorylation.	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein involved in the etiology of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, has been implicated in inflammatory processes in epithelial cells, as well as in immune cells. Experiments in this report indicate that BCL10 is required for activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB by both canonical and noncanonical pathways, following stimulation by the sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan (CGN). In wild type and IkappaB-kinase (IKK)alpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, increases in phospho-IkappaBalpha, nuclear NF-kappaB p65 (RelA) and p50, and KC, the mouse analog of human interleukin-8, were markedly reduced by silencing BCL10 or by exposure to the free radical scavenger Tempol. In IKKbeta(-/-) cells, BCL10 silencing, but not Tempol, reduced the CGN-induced increases in KC, phospho-NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytoplasmic NF-kappaB p100, and nuclear NF-kappaB p52 and RelB, suggesting a BCL10 requirement for activation of the noncanonical pathway. In NCM460 cells, derived from normal, human colonic epithelium, the CGN-induced increases in NF-kappaB family members, p65, p50, p52, and RelB, were inhibited by BCL10 silencing. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confocal images demonstrated no change in total NIK following CGN, increases in phospho-NIK in the wild type, IKKbeta(-/-) and IKKalpha(-/-) cells were inhibited by silencing BCL10. These findings indicate an upstream signaling role for BCL10, in addition to its effects on IKKgamma, the regulatory component of the IKK signalosome, and a requirement for BCL10 in both canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-kappaB activation. Also, the commonly used food additive carrageenan can be added to the short list of known activators of both pathways.	2010	01	26	J Biol Chem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
19950170	10.1002/eji.200939445	c-Rel phenocopies PKCtheta but not Bcl-10 in regulating CD8+ T-cell activation versus tolerance.	Elucidating the signaling events that promote T-cell tolerance versus activation provides important insights for manipulating immunity in vivo. Previous studies have suggested that the absence of PKCtheta results in the induction of anergy and that the balance between the induction of the transcription factors NFAT, AP1 and NF-kappaB plays a key role in determining whether T-cell anergy or activation is induced. Here, we examine whether Bcl-10 and specific family members of NF-kappaB act downstream of PKCtheta to alter CD8(+) T-cell activation and/or anergy. We showed that T cells from mice deficient in c-Rel but not NF-kappaB1 (p50) have increased susceptibility to the induction of anergy, similar to T cells from PKCtheta-deficient mice. Surprisingly T cells from Bcl-10-deficient mice showed a strikingly different phenotype to the PKCtheta-deficient T cells, with a severe block in TCR-mediated activation. Furthermore, we have also shown that survival signals downstream of NF-kappaB, are uncoupled from signals that mediate T-cell anergy. These results suggest that c-Rel plays a critical role downstream of PKCtheta in controlling CD8(+) T-cell anergy induction.	2010	04	16	Eur J Immunol	Deenick	Elissa K
20193035	10.1111/j.1744-313X.2010.00898.x	BCL10 as a new candidate gene for immune response in pigs: cloning, expression and association analysis.	BCL10 is an apoptotic regulatory molecule identified through its direct involvement in t(1; 14)(p22; q32) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and was implicated in the pathogenesis of this and several other tumour types. BCL10 was recognized as an antigen receptor-specific regulator of NF-kappaB, which showed close association with immune responses. In this study, we cloned and characterized BCL10 from the porcine spleen and analysed its genomic structure. BCL10 was mapped to SSC4q21-q23 by the IMpRH panels, it is closely linked to the marker S0161 and SW1461. This gene has three exons and two introns. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that BCL10 was widely expressed in all the examined tissues. Transient transfection indicated that porcine BCL10 was located in cytoplasm in Pig Kidney Epithelial cells. BCL10 gene displays the opposite expression trend between the two treatments mimic virus and bacteria of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The level of the BCL10 mRNA was up-regulated during 12-24 h and peaking at 48 h when treated with LPS, whereas it was down-regulated during 0-48 h and highest at 0 h (cells without treating with Poly I:C) when treated with Poly I:C. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site was identified in the 3'-untranslated region of porcine BCL10. Association analysis revealed that this SNP was significantly associated with intermediate cell mass (eosinophile granulocyte, basophile granulocyte and histoleucocyte) percentage, absolute intermediate cell mass count and mean red blood cell volume of 0-day-old pigs, and red blood cell count of 17-day-old pigs (P &lt; 0.05), and also had significant associations with red blood cell count and haemoglobin concentration of 32-day-old pigs (P &lt; 0.01).	2010	08	30	Int J Immunogenet	Huang	J
20235165	10.1002/path.2699	Interleukin-2 induces NF-kappaB activation through BCL10 and affects its subcellular localization in natural killer lymphoma cells.	Deregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signalling is common in cancers and is essential for tumourigenesis. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation in extranodal natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL) is known to be associated with aberrant nuclear translocation of BCL10. Here we investigated the mechanisms leading to NF-kappaB activation and BCL10 nuclear localization in ENKLs. Given that ENKLs are dependent on T-cell-derived interleukin-2 (IL2) for cytotoxicity and proliferation, we investigated whether IL2 modulates NF-kappaB activation and BCL10 subcellular localization in ENKLs. In the present study, IL2-activated NK lymphoma cells were found to induce NF-kappaB activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to an increase in the entry of G(2)/M phase and concomitant transcription of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. We also found that BCL10, a key mediator of NF-kappaB signalling, participates in the cytokine receptor-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Knockdown of BCL10 expression resulted in deficient NF-kappaB signalling, whereas Akt activation was unaffected. Our results suggest that BCL10 plays a role downstream of Akt in the IL2-triggered NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Moreover, the addition of IL2 to NK cells led to aberrant nuclear translocation of BCL10, which is a pathological feature of ENKLs. We further show that BCL10 can bind to BCL3, a transcriptional co-activator and nuclear protein. Up-regulation of BCL3 expression was observed in response to IL2. Similar to BCL10, the expression and nuclear translocation of BCL3 were induced by IL2 in an Akt-dependent manner. The nuclear translocation of BCL10 was also dependent on BCL3 because silencing BCL3 by RNA interference abrogated this translocation. We identified a critical role for BCL10 in the cytokine receptor-induced NF-kappaB signalling pathway, which is essential for NK cell activation. We also revealed the underlying mechanism that controls BCL10 nuclear translocation in NK cells. Our findings provide insight into a molecular network within the NF-kappaB signalling pathway that promotes the pathogenesis of NK cell lymphomas.	2010	07	28	J Pathol	Chan	Ka-Kui
20439115	10.1016/j.molimm.2010.04.005	Interaction of calmodulin with Bcl10 modulates NF-kappaB activation.	Calcium signals resulting from antigen receptor activation are important in determining the responses of a T or B lymphocyte to an antigen. Calmodulin (CaM), a multi-functional sensor of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) signals in cells, is required in the pathway from the T cell receptor (TCR) to activation of the key transcription factor NF-kappaB. Here we searched for a partner in direct interaction with CaM in the pathway, and found that CaM interacts specifically with the signaling adaptor Bcl10. The binding is Ca(2+) dependent and of high affinity, with a K(d) of approximately 160 nM. Proximity of CaM and Bcl10 in vivo is induced by increases in the intracellular Ca(2+) level. The interaction is localized to the CARD domain of Bcl10, which interacts with the CARD domain of the upstream signaling partner Carma1. Binding of CaM to Bcl10 is shown to inhibit the ability of Bcl10 to interact with Carma1, an interaction that is required for signaling from the TCR to NF-kappaB. Furthermore, a mutant of Bcl10 with reduced binding to CaM shows increased activation of an NF-kappaB reporter, which is further enhanced by activating stimuli. We propose a novel mechanism whereby the Ca(2+) sensor CaM regulates T cell responses to antigens by binding to Bcl10, thereby modulating its interaction with Carma1 and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB.	2010	07	12	Mol Immunol	Edin	Sofia
20466000	10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.05.004	Lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB non-canonical pathway requires BCL10 serine 138 and NIK phosphorylations.	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL)-10 and reactive oxygen species mediate two pathways of NF-κB (RelA) activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human colonic epithelial cells. The pathway for LPS activation of RelB by the non-canonical pathway (RelB) in non-myeloid cells was not yet reported, but important for understanding the range of potential microbial LPS-induced effects in inflammatory bowel disease. Experiments were performed in human colonic epithelial cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in components of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalosome, in order to detect mediators of the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, including nuclear RelB and p52 and phospho- and total NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). BCL10 was silenced by siRNA and effects of mutations of specific phosphorylation sites of BCL10 (Ser138Gly and Ser218Gly) were determined. By the non-canonical pathway, LPS exposure increased nuclear RelB and p52, and phospho-NIK, with no change in total NIK. Phosphorylation of BCL10 serine 138 was required for NIK phosphorylation, since mutation of this residue eliminated the increases in phospho-NIK and nuclear RelB and p52. Mutations of either serine 138 or serine 218 reduced RelA, p50, and phospho-IκBα of the canonical pathway. Effects of LPS stimulation and BCL10 silencing on NIK phosphorylation were demonstrated in confocal images. LPS induces activation of both canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB in human colonic epithelial cells, and the non-canonical pathway requires phosphorylations of BCL10 (serine 138) and NIK. These findings demonstrate the important role of BCL10 in mediating LPS-induced inflammation in human colonic epithelial cells and may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions.	2010	11	10	Exp Cell Res	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
20507572	10.1186/1471-2172-11-26	Differential cytokine regulation by NF-kappaB and AP-1 in Jurkat T-cells.	Activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB largely control T-cell activation, following binding of foreign antigens to the T-cell receptor leading to cytokine secretion. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, in IL-6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T-cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia. coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NF-kappaB activity without affecting AP-1. The cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli. AP-1 activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter. In contrast, NF-kappaB responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of NF-kappaB by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced NF-kappaB activity following induction with HK E. coli. In order to further study NF-kappaB activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, PKC and Bcl10. Phosphorylated-PKC levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while Bcl10 levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment. Using an NF-kappaB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL-6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of JNK-inhibitor suppressed both CXCL8 and IL-6 while PKC-inhibitor primarily decreased CXCL8 expression. The present study shows that NF-kappaB regulated IL-6 but not CXCL8. This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.	2010	09	09	BMC Immunol	Khalaf	Hazem
20516126	10.1101/cshperspect.a000109	Oncogenic activation of NF-kappaB.	Recent genetic evidence has established a pathogenetic role for NF-kappaB signaling in cancer. NF-kappaB signaling is engaged transiently when normal B lymphocytes respond to antigens, but lymphomas derived from these cells accumulate genetic lesions that constitutively activate NF-kappaB signaling. Many genetic aberrations in lymphomas alter CARD11, MALT1, or BCL10, which constitute a signaling complex that is intermediate between the B-cell receptor and IkappaB kinase. The activated B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma activates NF-kappaB by a variety of mechanisms including oncogenic mutations in CARD11 and a chronic active form of B-cell receptor signaling. Normal plasma cells activate NF-kappaB in response to ligands in the bone marrow microenvironment, but their malignant counterpart, multiple myeloma, sustains a variety of genetic hits that stabilize the kinase NIK, leading to constitutive activation of the classical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways. Various oncogenic abnormalities in epithelial cancers, including mutant K-ras, engage unconventional IkappaB kinases to activate NF-kappaB. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB signaling in each of these cancer types induces apoptosis, providing a rationale for the development of NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.	2010	09	08	Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol	Staudt	Louis M
20520640	10.1038/leu.2010.118	Differential expression of NF-kappaB target genes in MALT lymphoma with and without chromosome translocation: insights into molecular mechanism.	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is characterized by t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH and t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, which commonly activate the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway. Gastric MALT lymphomas harboring such translocations usually do not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication, while most of those without translocation can be cured by antibiotics. To understand the molecular mechanism of these different MALT lymphoma subgroups, we performed gene expression profiling analysis of 21 MALT lymphomas (13 translocation-positive, 8 translocation-negative). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the NF-kappaB target genes and 4394 additional gene sets covering various cellular pathways, biological processes and molecular functions have shown that translocation-positive MALT lymphomas are characterized by an enhanced expression of NF-kappaB target genes, particularly toll like receptor (TLR)6, chemokine, CC motif, receptor (CCR)2, cluster of differentiation (CD)69 and B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL)2, while translocation-negative cases were featured by active inflammatory and immune responses, such as interleukin-8, CD86, CD28 and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS). Separate analyses of the genes differentially expressed between translocation-positive and -negative cases and measurement of gene ontology term in these differentially expressed genes by hypergeometric test reinforced the above findings by GSEA. Finally, expression of TLR6, in the presence of TLR2, enhanced both API2-MALT1 and BCL10-mediated NF-kappaB activation in vitro. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of MALT lymphomas with and without translocation, potentially explaining their different clinical behaviors.	2010	09	14	Leukemia	Hamoudi	R A
20538615	10.1074/jbc.M110.131300	CARD9 mediates dectin-2-induced IkappaBalpha kinase ubiquitination leading to activation of NF-kappaB in response to stimulation by the hyphal form of Candida albicans.	The scaffold protein CARD9 plays an essential role in anti-fungus immunity and is implicated in mediating Dectin-1/Syk-induced NF-kappaB activation in response to Candida albicans infection. However, the molecular mechanism by which CARD9 mediates C. albicans-induced NF-kappaB activation is not fully characterized. Here we demonstrate that CARD9 is involved in mediating NF-kappaB activation induced by the hyphal form of C. albicans hyphae (Hyphae) but not by its heat-inactivated unicellular form. Our data show that inhibiting Dectin-2 expression selectively blocked Hyphae-induced NF-kappaB, whereas inhibiting Dectin-1 mainly suppressed zymosan-induced NF-kappaB, indicating that Hyphae-induced NF-kappaB activation is mainly through Dectin-2 and not Dectin-1. Consistently, we find that the hyphae stimulation induces CARD9 association with Bcl10, an adaptor protein that functions downstream of CARD9 and is also involved in C. albicans-induced NF-kappaB activation. This association is dependent on Dectin-2 but not Dectin-1 following the hyphae stimulation. Finally, we find that although both CARD9 and Syk are required for Hyphae-induced NF-kappaB activation, they regulate different signaling events in which CARD9 mediates IkappaBalpha kinase ubiquitination, whereas Syk regulates IkappaBalpha kinase phosphorylation. Together, our data demonstrated that CARD9 is selectively involved in Dectin-2-induced NF-kappaB activation in response to C. albicans hyphae challenging.	2010	09	30	J Biol Chem	Bi	Liangkuan
20551178	10.1242/jcs.069476	Interplay between BCL10, MALT1 and IkappaBalpha during T-cell-receptor-mediated NFkappaB activation.	T-cell-receptor (TCR) signalling to NFkappaB requires the assembly of a large multiprotein complex containing the serine/threonine kinase CK1alpha, the scaffold protein CARMA1, the heterodimer BCL10-MALT1 (the CBM complex) and the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK). Although the mechanisms regulating recruitment and activation of IKK within the CBM microenvironment have been extensively studied, there is little understanding of how IKK subsequently binds and phosphorylates IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NFkappaB, to promote IkappaBalpha ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that BCL10, MALT1 and IKK inducibly associate with IkappaBalpha in a complex that is physically distinct from the early CK1alpha-CBM signalosome. This IkappaBalpha-containing complex probably maturates from the CBM, because siRNA-based knockdown of CARMA1, CK1alpha and BCL10 hampered its assembly, leading to a reduction in NFkappaB activation. By contrast, CK1alpha normally recruited both BCL10 and ubiquitylated species of MALT1 when IkappaBalpha levels were reduced. However, knockdown of IkappaBalpha led to an altered ubiquitylation profile of BCL10-MALT1 combined with a defect in MALT1 reorganisation within large cytoplasmic structures, suggesting that, following stimulation, IkappaBalpha might also participate in MALT1 recycling. Altogether, our data suggest a two-step mechanism to connect active IKK to IkappaBalpha, and further unveil a potential role for IkappaBalpha in resetting TCR-mediated signalling.	2010	11	26	J Cell Sci	Carvalho	Gabrielle
20605784	10.1074/jbc.C110.109421	The CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome promotes angiotensin II-dependent vascular inflammation and atherogenesis.	The CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins together constitute a signaling complex (CBM signalosome) that mediates antigen-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in lymphocytes, thereby representing a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response. Although CARMA1 is restricted to cells of the immune system, the analogous CARMA3 protein has a much wider expression pattern. Emerging evidence suggests that CARMA3 can substitute for CARMA1 in non-immune cells to assemble a CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome and mediate G protein-coupled receptor activation of NF-kappaB. Here we show that one G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 receptor for angiotensin II, utilizes this mechanism for activation of NF-kappaB in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inducing pro-inflammatory signals within the vasculature, a key factor in atherogenesis. Further, we demonstrate that Bcl10-deficient mice are protected from developing angiotensin-dependent atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. By uncovering a novel vascular role for the CBM signalosome, these findings illustrate that CBM-dependent signaling has functions outside the realm of adaptive immunity and impacts pathobiology more broadly than previously known.	2010	09	30	J Biol Chem	McAllister-Lucas	Linda M
20679053		[Orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas. Clinico-pathological correlation in 25 cases].	Clinical, histological features and outcome of a cohort of patients with orbital and adnexal lymphoproliferative tumors were evaluated. Twenty-five cases in an oncologic referral center from 1995 to 2008, were included in the study. Each case had detailed immunophenotypic analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CD45, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, BCL10, Ki67, CD30, CD15, BCL1, Kappa, Lambda, CD138). Lesions were classified by using WHO (2008) lymphomas classification. Twenty-three patients were found to have primary and two secondary lymphomas. Histological subtypes were: 16 patients with marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, four diffuse large B cell lymphomas, two mantle cell lymphomas, two follicular lymphomas, and one Hodgkin lymphoma. Among the 25 patients studied, 22 had localized stage. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma was the most frequent type of primary orbital and adnexal lymphoma. In this study localized disease was observed in most cases, and distant spread of the lymphomas was infrequent.	2011	10	18	Medicina (B Aires)	Rojas Bilbao	Erica A

The signaling pathway controlling antigen receptor-induced regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a key role in lymphocyte activation and development and the generation of lymphomas. Work of the past decade has led to dramatic progress in the identification and characterization of new players in the pathway. Moreover, novel enzymatic activities relevant for this pathway have been discovered, which represent interesting drug targets for immuno-suppression or lymphoma treatment. Here, we summarize these findings and give an outlook on interesting open issues that need to be addressed in the future.	2011	01	05	Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol	Thome	Margot
20799731	10.1021/bi101052d	Oncogenic CARD11 mutations induce hyperactive signaling by disrupting autoinhibition by the PKC-responsive inhibitory domain.	The regulated activation of NF-κB by antigen receptor signaling is required for normal B and T lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. Dysregulated NF-κB activation is associated with several types of lymphoma, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). During normal antigen receptor signaling, the multidomain scaffold protein CARD11 undergoes a transition from a closed, inactive state to an open, active conformation that recruits several signaling proteins into a complex, leading to IKK kinase activation. This transition is regulated by the CARD11 inhibitory domain (ID), which participates in intramolecular interactions that prevent cofactor binding to CARD11 prior to signaling, but which is neutralized after receptor engagement by phosphorylation. Several oncogenic CARD11 mutations have been identified in DLBCL that enhance activity and that are mostly found in the coiled-coil domain. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations cause CARD11 hyperactivity and spontaneous NF-κB activation are poorly understood. In this report, we provide several lines of evidence that oncogenic mutations F123I and L225LI induce CARD11 hyperactivity by disrupting autoinhibition by the CARD11 ID. These mutations disrupt ID-mediated intramolecular interactions and ID-dependent inhibition and bypass the requirement for ID phosphorylation during T cell receptor signaling. Intriguingly, these mutations selectively enhance the apparent affinity of CARD11 for Bcl10, but not for other signaling proteins that are recruited to CARD11 in an ID-dependent manner during normal antigen receptor signaling. Our results establish a mechanism that explains how DLBCL-associated mutations in CARD11 can initiate spontaneous, receptor-independent activation of NF-κB.	2010	10	22	Biochemistry	Lamason	Rebecca L
20937806	10.1074/jbc.M110.159681	Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced inflammation is increased but apoptosis is inhibited by common food additive carrageenan.	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a homotrimeric, pleiotropic cytokine, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-α mediates both apoptosis and inflammation, stimulating an inflammatory cascade through the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, leading to increased nuclear RelB and p52. In contrast, the common food additive carrageenan (CGN) stimulates inflammation through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB activation and utilizes the adaptor molecule BCL10 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10). In a series of experiments, colonic epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TNF-α and carrageenan in order to simulate the possible effects of exposure to dietary CGN in the setting of a TNF-α-mediated inflammatory disease process. A marked increase in secretion of IL-8 occurred, attributable to synergistic effects on phosphorylated NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the non-canonical pathway. TNF-α induced the ubiquitination of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), which interacts with NIK, and CGN induced phosphorylation of BCL10, leading to increased NIK phosphorylation. These results suggest that TNF-α and CGN in combination act to increase NIK phosphorylation, thereby increasing activation of the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. In contrast, the apoptotic effects of TNF-α, including activation of caspase-8 and PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) fragmentation, were markedly reduced in the presence of CGN, and CGN caused reduced expression of Fas. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CGN drives TNF-α-stimulated cells toward inflammation rather than toward apoptotic cell death and suggest that CGN exposure may compromise the effectiveness of anti-TNF-α therapy.	2011	01	10	J Biol Chem	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
21041303	10.1074/jbc.M110.158949	Thrombin-dependent NF-{kappa}B activation and monocyte/endothelial adhesion are mediated by the CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome.	Thrombin is a potent modulator of endothelial function and, through stimulation of NF-κB, induces endothelial expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). These cell surface adhesion molecules recruit inflammatory cells to the vessel wall and thereby participate in the development of atherosclerosis, which is increasingly recognized as an inflammatory condition. The principal receptor for thrombin on endothelial cells is protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Although it is known that PAR-1 signaling to NF-κB depends on initial PKC activation, the subsequent steps leading to stimulation of the canonical NF-κB machinery have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a complex of proteins containing CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1 links PAR-1 activation to stimulation of the IκB kinase complex. IκB kinase in turn phosphorylates IκB, leading to its degradation and the release of active NF-κB. Further, we find that although this CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome shares features with a CARMA1-containing signalosome found in lymphocytes, there are significant differences in how the signalosomes communicate with their cognate receptors. Specifically, whereas the CARMA1-containing lymphocyte complex relies on 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 for assembly and activation, the CARMA3-containing endothelial signalosome functions completely independent of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and instead relies on β-arrestin 2 for assembly. Finally, we show that thrombin-dependent adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells requires an intact endothelial CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome, underscoring the importance of the signalosome in mediating one of the most significant pro-atherogenic effects of thrombin.	2011	02	09	J Biol Chem	Delekta	Phillip C
21084243	10.1684/bdc.2010.1214	[Molecular abnormalities in lymphomas].	Numerous molecular abnormalities have been described in lymphomas. They are of diagnostic and prognostic value and are taken into account for the WHO classification of these tumors. They also shed some light on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in lymphomas. Overall, four types of molecular abnormalities are involved: mutations, translocations, amplifications and deletions of tumor suppressor genes. Several techniques are available to detect these molecular anomalies: conventional cytogenetic analysis, multicolor FISH, CGH array or gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays. In some lymphomas, genetic abnormalities are responsible for the expression of an abnormal protein (e.g. tyrosine-kinase, transcription factor) detectable by immunohistochemistry. In the present review, molecular abnormalities observed in the most frequent B, T or NK cell lymphomas are discussed. In the broad spectrum of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas microarray analysis shows mostly two subgroups of tumors, one with gene expression signature corresponding to germinal center B-cell-like (GCB: CD10+, BCL6 [B-Cell Lymphoma 6]+, centerine+, MUM1-) and a subgroup expressing an activated B-cell-like signature (ABC: CD10-, BCL6-, centerine-, MUM1+). Among other B-cell lymphomas with well characterized molecular abnormalies are follicular lymphoma (BCL2 deregulation), MALT lymphoma (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) [API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-lymphoma-translocation-gene1) fusion protein or deregulation BCL10, MALT1, FOXP1. MALT1 transcription factors], mantle cell lymphoma (cycline D1 [CCND1] overexpression) and Burkitt lymphoma (c-Myc expression). Except for ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, well characterized molecular anomalies are rare in lymphomas developed from T or NK cells. Peripheral T cell lymphomas not otherwise specified are a heterogeneous group of tumors with frequent but not recurrent molecular abnormalities. Gene profiling analysis shows that the expression of several genes is deregulated including PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) gene, encoding a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. In angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphomas molecular abnormalities are found in follicular helper T-cell (TFH) that express some distinctive markers such as CD10, PD-1, CXCR5 and the CXCL13 chemokine. ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a paradigme of T-cell lymphoma since it is associated with an X-ALK oncogenic fusion protein due to a translocation involving ALK gene at 2p23. ALK tyrosine kinase activates downstream pathways (Stat3/5b, Src kinases, PLCγ, PI3 kinase) implicated in lymphomagenesis, proliferation and protection against apoptosis. Specific ALK inhibitors are currently in clinical evaluation. Lastly several lymphomas are associated with infectious agents that play a direct (EB virus, HTLV1) or indirect role (e.g. Helicobacter pylori in MALT lymphoma) in lymphomagenesis.	2010	12	22	Bull Cancer	Delsol	G
22282688	10.2147/JBM.S9772	L-CBM signaling in lymphocyte development and function.	The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a central role in the activation and survival of lymphocytes. NF-κB, therefore, is pivotal for acquired immunity, but the dysregulation of NF-κB signaling leads to inflammatory diseases and lymphomagenesis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma-related molecules, B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and MALT-lymphoma-translocation gene1 (MALT1), are essential signaling components for NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, mediated by the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. CARMA1 (also referred to as CARD11 and Bimp3) is a crucial regulator for ITAM-mediated signaling as it forms a complex with BCL10-MALT1 in lymphoid lineage cells such as T, B, natural killer (NK), and natural killer T (NKT) cells, known as the lymphoid CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (L-CBM) complex. In this review, recent understanding of the molecular and biological functions and the signal regulation mechanisms of the L-CBM complex are described and its role in disease development and potential as a therapeutic target is further discussed.	2012	08	23	J Blood Med	Hara	Hiromitsu
18775860	10.1167/iovs.08-2539	Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma in the ocular region: clinical, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetical characteristics.	To evaluate clinical, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetical characteristics of 116 patients with a diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) presenting primarily in the ocular region. Specimens from all patients with a diagnosis of ophthalmic lymphoma in Denmark during the period 1980 to 2005 were reviewed and reclassified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Cases reclassified as EMZL were selected and reviewed with respect to clinical characteristics and outcome. The presence of translocations involving IGH and/or MALT1 was investigated in 42 specimens by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Median age was 69 years. Most lymphomas were located in the orbit. Approximately one fourth of the patients had disseminated disease at presentation. One third experienced a relapse or progression of disease after initial therapy, and relapses were frequently found at extraocular sites. Five-year progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were 71% and 75%, respectively. Translocations involving the IGH- or MALT1-gene loci were detected in 2 (5%) of 42 specimens. In Cox regression multivariate analysis, IGH-translocation was the only factor associated with PFS, whereas a favorable International Prognostic Index (IPI) score was the most reliable predictor of OS. EMZL presenting in the ocular region usually runs an indolent course, but relapses are frequently seen. The IPI-score was the most reliable independent parameter for estimating risk of death in our cohort of patients. Furthermore, we found that the frequency of translocations involving the MALT1- and IGH-gene loci is low in ocular region EMZL.	2009	02	06	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	Sjö	Lene D
18952491	10.1016/j.oraloncology.2008.08.003	Expression of BCL10 is significantly associated with the progression and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas in Taiwan.	This study used an immunohistochemical technique to examine the expression of BCL10 in 93 specimens of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 21 specimens of normal oral mucosa (NOM). We found a significant correlation between the higher mean BCL10 labeling index (LI) and OSCCs at the tongue, with larger tumor size, with positive lymph node metastasis, with more advanced clinical stages, or with recurrence (all p-values=0.000). Positive lymph node metastasis (p=0.044) and BCL10 LI&gt;50% (p=0.037) were identified as independent unfavorable prognosis factors by multivariate analyses with Cox regression model. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that OSCC patients with a BCL10 LI&gt;50% had a significantly poorer cumulative survival than those with a BCL10 LI&lt;50% (log-rank test, p&lt;0.00001). We conclude that the BCL10 LI in OSCC samples can predict the progression of OSCCs and the survival of OSCC patients.	2010	12	02	Oral Oncol	Chang	Hao-Hueng
19066953	10.1007/s00428-008-0710-x	The monoclonal anti-BCL10 antibody (clone 331.1) is a sensitive and specific marker of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatic metaplasia.	Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pancreatic cancer which may be difficult to distinguish from other solid nonadenocarcinoma tumors. The diagnosis depends on the demonstration of acinar differentiation, obtained with antibodies recognizing various pancreatic enzymes that, although specific, show different sensitivity. The C-terminal portion of the BCL10 protein shows homology with carboxyl ester hydrolase (CEH), an enzyme produced by pancreatic acinar cells. We investigated the usefulness of a C-terminal BCL10 monoclonal antibody in the diagnosis of ACCs. We examined normal pancreases and different pancreatic tumors including ACCs, mixed acinar-endocrine carcinomas, ductal adenocarcinomas, mucinous, serous, solid pseudopapillary, and endocrine neoplasms. In addition, various normal tissues and cases of pancreatic metaplasia of the gastroesophageal mucosa, cases of ectopic pancreas, gastrointestinal endocrine tumors, salivary and breast acinic cell carcinomas, gastric adenocarcinomas with and without acinar differentiation, and hepatocellular carcinomas were studied. BCL10 immunoreactivity paralleled that of CEH and was restricted to acinar cells of normal and ectopic pancreas, of pancreatic metaplasia, and of ACCs. The anti-BCL10 antibody was more sensitive in detecting ACCs and pancreatic metaplasia than antibodies directed against other pancreatic enzymes. We suggest using BCL10 antibody for diagnosing pancreatic tumors and whenever an acinar differentiation is suspected in gastrointestinal neoplastic and metaplastic lesions.	2009	08	03	Virchows Arch	La Rosa	Stefano
19085995	10.1002/ibd.20821	ROS, Hsp27, and IKKbeta mediate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) activation of IkappaBa, NFkappaB, and IL-8.	Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) is a sulfated polysaccharide that has been very widely used to induce inflammation in experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease in which the effects of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are tested. However, the precise mechanisms by which DSS induces inflammation have not been elucidated. DSS-induced increases in phospho-IkappaBalpha, nuclear NFkappaB (p65), and IL-8 secretion in human colonic epithelial cells in tissue culture are attributable to a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced pathway of inflammation, and do not require TLR4, MyD88, or Bcl10, which are associated with the innate immune pathway of NFkappaB-IL-8 activation. DSS-induced increases were inhibited by the ROS scavengers Tempol and Tiron, were associated with decreased phosphorylation of MAPK12 (p38gamma), MAPK 13 (p38delta), and Hsp27, and required the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalosome component IKKbeta. In ex vivo colonic tissue from TLR4-deficient mice, or following knockdown of MyD88 or Bcl10 or exposure to an IRAK 1/4 inhibitor, DSS effects were not suppressed. Data demonstrated that DSS activates IkappaBalpha, NFkappaB, and IL-8 through an ROS-Hsp27-IKKbeta-mediated pathway, and not through an innate immune cascade. These results suggest that DSS models of inflammation may not be optimal for evaluation of interventions that involve mechanisms of innate immunity.	2009	08	11	Inflamm Bowel Dis	Bhattacharyya	Sumit
19112107	10.1074/jbc.C800207200	CXCL8/IL8 stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and the autocrine activation of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells by activating NFkappaB through the CBM (Carma3/Bcl10/Malt1) complex.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogen and permeability factor for endothelial cells that plays a central role in angiogenesis, vascular maintenance, inflammation, and cancer. VEGF also mediates the homeostatic adaptation to hypoxic conditions by promoting an increase in vascular density to compensate for decreased oxygenation. This process is triggered by an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1alpha), which becomes active in hypoxic tissues, leading to the synthesis and secretion of VEGF. The role of HIF1alpha in other processes that involve angiogenesis such as in inflammation is less clear. Of interest, endothelial cells not only respond to but also store and secrete VEGF, which is required for the maintenance of the integrity of the vascular system. How this intracellular pool of VEGF is regulated is still not understood. Here, we found that CXCL8/IL8, a potent proangiogenic and inflammatory chemokine, up-regulates VEGF mRNA and protein levels in endothelial cells by acting on its cognate receptor, CXCR2, and that this results in the autocrine activation of VEGFR2. Surprisingly, this process does not involve HIF1alpha but instead requires the activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB. Furthermore, we identified the components of the CBM complex, Carma3, Bcl10, and Malt1, as key mediators of the CXCL8/IL8-induced NFkappaB activation and VEGF up-regulation. Together, these findings support the existence of an NFkappaB-mediated pathway by which the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL8/IL8 controls the expression of VEGF in endothelial cells, thereby promoting the activation of VEGF receptors in an autocrine fashion.	2009	04	27	J Biol Chem	Martin	Daniel
19118383	10.1038/nature07613	Casein kinase 1alpha governs antigen-receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation and human lymphoma cell survival.	The transcription factor NF-kappaB is required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as the survival of certain lymphoma types. Antigen receptor stimulation assembles an NF-kappaB activating platform containing the scaffold protein CARMA1 (also called CARD11), the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (the CBM complex), linked to the inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase complex, but signal transduction is not fully understood. We conducted parallel screens involving a mass spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 binding partners and an RNA interference screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent 'activated B-cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here we report that both screens identified casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappaB. CK1alpha dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T-cell-receptor (TCR) engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation. However, CK1alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of CARMA1. CK1alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappaB. ABC DLBCL cells required CK1alpha for constitutive NF-kappaB activity, indicating that CK1alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene-a member of a new class of potential cancer therapeutic targets.	2009	04	21	Nature	Bidère	Nicolas
19124758	10.4049/jimmunol.182.2.1146	Differential use of CARD9 by dectin-1 in macrophages and dendritic cells.	The pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and Dectin-1 play key roles in coordinating the responses of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) to fungi. Induction of proinflammatory cytokines is instructed by signals from both TLR2 and Dectin-1. A recent report identified a role for CARD9 in innate anti-fungal responses, demonstrating CARD9-Bcl10-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and proinflammatory cytokine induction in murine bone marrow-derived DC stimulated via Dectin-1. We now report that Dectin-1-CARD9 signals fail to activate NF-kappaB and drive TNF-alpha induction in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. However, priming of bone marrow-derived macrophages with GM-CSF or IFN-gamma permits Dectin-1-CARD9-mediated TNF-alpha induction. Analysis of other macrophage/DC populations revealed further variation in the ability of Dectin-1-CARD9 signaling to drive TNF-alpha production. Resident peritoneal cells and alveolar macrophages produce TNF-alpha upon Dectin-1 ligation, while thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages and Flt3L-derived DC do not. We present data demonstrating that CARD9 is recruited to phagosomes via its CARD domain where it enhances TLR-induced cytokine production even in cells in which Dectin-1 is insufficient to drive cytokine production. In such cells, Dectin-1, CARD9, and Bcl10 levels are not limiting, and data indicate that these cells express additional factors that restrict Dectin-1-CARD9 signaling for TNF-alpha induction.	2009	02	19	J Immunol	Goodridge	Helen S
19136564	10.1074/jbc.M806650200	Phospholipase Cgamma2 is critical for Dectin-1-mediated Ca2+ flux and cytokine production in dendritic cells.	Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin that recognizes beta-glucan in the cell walls of fungi and plays an important role in anti-fungal immunity. It signals via tyrosine kinase Syk and adaptor protein Card9 to activate NF-kappaB leading to proinflammatory cytokine production in dendritic cells (DCs). Other than this, not much else is known of the mechanism of Dectin-1 signaling. We demonstrate here that stimulation of DCs with zymosan triggers an intracellular Ca2+ flux that can be attenuated by a blocking anti-Dectin-1 antibody or by pre-treatment of cells with the phospholipase C (PLC) gamma-inhibitor U73122, suggesting that Dectin-1 signals via a PLCgamma pathway to induce Ca2+ flux in DCs. Interestingly, treatment of DCs with particulate curdlan, which specifically engages Dectin-1, results in the phosphorylation of both PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2. However, we show that PLCgamma2 is the critical enzyme for Dectin-1 signaling in DCs. PLCgamma2-deficient DCs have drastic impairment of Ca2+ signaling and are defective in their secretion of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. PLCgamma2-deficient DCs also exhibit impaired activation of ERK and JNK MAPKs and AP-1 and NFAT transcription factors in response to Dectin-1 stimulation. In addition, PLCgamma2-deficient DCs are also impaired in their activation of NF-kappaB upon Dectin-1 engagement due to defective assembly of the Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 complex and impaired IKKalpha/beta activation and IkappaBalpha degradation. Thus, our data indicate that pattern recognition receptors such as Dectin-1 could elicit Ca2+ signaling and that PLCgamma2 is a critical player in the Dectin-1 signal transduction pathway.	2009	05	04	J Biol Chem	Xu	Shengli
19139169	10.1084/jem.20081445	Adjuvanticity of a synthetic cord factor analogue for subunit Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccination requires FcRgamma-Syk-Card9-dependent innate immune activation.	Novel vaccination strategies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are urgently needed. The use of recombinant MTB antigens as subunit vaccines is a promising approach, but requires adjuvants that activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for elicitation of protective immunity. The mycobacterial cord factor Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM) and its synthetic analogue Trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB) are effective adjuvants in combination with MTB subunit vaccine candidates in mice. However, it is unknown which signaling pathways they engage in APCs and how these pathways are coupled to the adaptive immune response. Here, we demonstrate that these glycolipids activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) via Syk-Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 signaling to induce a specific innate activation program distinct from the response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. APC activation by TDB and TDM was independent of the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1, but required the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing adaptor protein Fc receptor gamma chain (FcRgamma). In vivo, TDB and TDM adjuvant activity induced robust combined T helper (Th)-1 and Th-17 T cell responses to a MTB subunit vaccine and partial protection against MTB challenge in a Card9-dependent manner. These data provide a molecular basis for the immunostimulatory activity of TDB and TDM and identify the Syk-Card9 pathway as a rational target for vaccine development against tuberculosis.	2009	02	23	J Exp Med	Werninghaus	Kerstin
19144384	10.1016/j.humpath.2008.06.032	BCL2, BCL6, MYC, MALT 1, and BCL10 rearrangements in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas: a multicenter evaluation of a new set of fluorescent in situ hybridization probes and correlation with clinical outcome.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although it is a curable disease, fewer than half of patients are cured with conventional chemotherapy. The highly variable outcome reflects a heterogeneous group of tumors, with different genetic abnormalities and responses to therapy. We analyzed 74 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization with commercially available probes for split-signal targeting BCL-2, BCL-6, MYC, BCL-10, and MALT-1. Gene rearrangements were identified in 48 (65%) of 74 cases. BCL-6 was the most rearranged gene (45%), followed by BCL-2 (21%), BCL-10 (18%), and MYC (16%). No MALT-1 rearrangements were found. When diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases were subdivided into germinal-center B-cell-like and activated B-cell-like groups, an inverse pattern of BCL-2 and BCL-6 rearrangements was observed. Of interest, the presence of chromosome rearrangements was associated with a worse prognosis. The pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities highlighted the fact not only that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous entity but also that even individual cases may contain subclones bearing different chromosomal rearrangements. The relevance and the clinical implication of minor clones showing gene rearrangements are poorly understood; however, this first observation suggests that different rearrangements may be involved in the progression of the disease. The fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis with the panel used in this study is useful to detect the heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and identify alterations with prognostic implications.	2009	06	05	Hum Pathol	Tibiletti	Maria Grazia
19279678	10.1371/journal.pone.0004822	Auto-ubiquitination-induced degradation of MALT1-API2 prevents BCL10 destabilization in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphoma.	The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) is the most frequent chromosomal aberration associated with MALT lymphoma and results in constitutive NF-kappaB activity via the expression of an API2-MALT1 fusion protein. The properties of the reciprocal MALT1-API2 were never investigated as it was reported to be rarely transcribed. Our data indicate the presence of MALT1-API2 transcripts in the majority of t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas. Based on the breakpoints in the MALT1 and API2 gene, the MALT1-API2 protein contains the death domain and one or both immunoglobulin-like domains of MALT1 (approximately 90% of cases)--mediating the possible interaction with BCL10--fused to the RING domain of API2. Here we show that this RING domain enables MALT1-API2 to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for BCL10, inducing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in vitro. Expression of MALT1-API2 transcripts in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas was however not associated with a reduction of BCL10 protein levels. As we observed MALT1-API2 to be an efficient target of its own E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, our data suggest that this inherent instability of MALT1-API2 prevents its accumulation and renders a potential effect on MALT lymphoma development via destabilization of BCL10 unlikely.	2009	05	04	PLoS One	Noels	Heidi

The events following triggering of antigen receptors and subsequent activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) need to be carefully controlled to prevent abnormal immune responses. BCL10 links the antigen receptor to NFkappaB. The aim of this study was to determine the expression pattern of BCL10 and NFkappaB in minor salivary gland infiltrates of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Minor salivary glands from patients with primary SS (n = 17) and sicca controls (n = 4) were evaluated by single and double immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for confocal microscopy. BCL10 and NFkappaB-p65 expression were evaluated in the infiltrating lymphocytes. Ectopic germinal centers (GCs) were investigated by CD21. Tonsil, lymph node and lymphoma tissue were used as positive controls. BCL10 nuclear positive cells were observed in focal lymphocytic infiltrates in the investigated minor salivary glands and were not restricted to patients with ectopic GCs. By double-staining, some of the BCL10 nuclear positive cells were identified as B cells. There was, however, no constitutive activation of NFkappaB as depicted by the exclusive cytoplasmic expression of p65 in the infiltrating lymphocytes in the pSS. Nuclear expression of BCL10 in infiltrating lymphocytes was a common occurrence in pSS minor salivary glands indicating it as a possible marker of autoimmune induced chronic inflammation. There was, however, no constitutive activation of NFkappaB.	2009	10	29	J Oral Pathol Med	Gatumu	Margaret K
19309400	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2009.03250.x	Bcl-10 protein highly correlates with the expression of phosphorylated p65 NF-kappaB in peripheral T-cell lymphomas and is associated with clinical outcome.	In T cells, protein kinase C (PKC) theta plays a major role in T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of a novel nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway that involves phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 (Pp65(Ser536)). Bcl-10 acts along the same pathway downstream of PKC theta to activate NF-kappaB. The aim was to investigate the relationship between the expression of PKC theta, Bcl-10 and P-p65(Ser536) proteins and their prognostic significance in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs). Paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 patients with PTCLs treated with curative intention were evaluated retrospectively. Expression of PKC theta, Bcl-10 and P-p65(Ser536) proteins was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Expression of PKC theta was detected in 22 of 30 cases (73%), Bcl-10 in 20 of 30 (67%) and P-p65(Ser536) in 21 of 30 (70%). Bcl-10+ tumours were associated with PKC theta (18 of 22) (P &lt; 0.0001) and Pp65Ser536 (19 of 21) expression (P &lt; 0.0001). Patients with Bcl-10+ or P-p65(Ser536+) tumours fared better, with a 5-year overall survival of 48 and 45%, respectively, versus 0% for negative tumours (P = 0.029 and P = 0.04, respectively). Bcl-10 is expressed in PTCLs, correlates with PKC theta and Pp65(Ser536) expression and seems to be associated with better survival.	2009	06	15	Histopathology	Briones	Javier

Chromosomal translocations are the hallmark genetic aberration in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with specific translocations often selectively associated with specific NHL subtypes. Because many NHL-associated translocations involve cell cycle, apoptosis, and lymphocyte development regulatory genes, we evaluated NHL risk associated with common genetic variation in 20 candidate genes in these pathways. Genotyping of 203 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was conducted in 1,946 NHL cases and 1,808 controls pooled from 3 independent population-based case-control studies. We used logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NHL and four major NHL subtypes in relation to tag SNP genotypes and haplotypes. We observed the most striking associations for tag SNPs in the proapoptotic gene BCL2L11 (BIM) and BCL7A, which is involved in a rare NHL-associated translocation. Variants in BCL2L11 were strongly related to follicular lymphoma only, particularly rs3789068 (OR(AG), 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.81; OR(GG), 1.65; 95% CI, 1.25-2.19; P(trend) = 0.0004). Variants in BCL7A were strongly related to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma only, particularly rs1880030 (OR(AG), 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08-1.68; OR(AA), 1.60; 95% CI, 1.22-2.08; P(trend) = 0.0004). The associations for both variants were similar in all three studies and supported by haplotype analyses. We also observed notable associations for variants in BCL6, CCND1, and MYC. Our results support the role of common genetic variation in cell cycle, apoptosis, and lymphocyte development regulatory genes in lymphomagenesis, and suggest that effects may vary by NHL subtype. Replication of our findings and further study to identify functional SNPs are warranted.	2009	06	16	Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	Morton	Lindsay M
19359218	10.1016/j.it.2009.03.002	CARD9 versus CARMA1 in innate and adaptive immunity.	Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated upon engagement of a wide variety of immunoreceptors. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT1) are essential signaling components for NF-kappaB and MAPK activation mediated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors in both adaptive and innate immunity. Recent studies have revealed that two caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) family adaptor molecules, CARD-containing MAGUK protein 1 (CARMA1) and CARD9, are crucial regulators of the ITAM-mediated signaling pathway by forming a complex with BCL10-MALT1 in lymphoid and myeloid cells, respectively. Here, we describe the immune responses and the cell-type-specific regulation mechanisms for NF-kappaB and MAPK activation controlled by CARMA1 and CARD9 through innate and adaptive immunoreceptors.	2009	07	23	Trends Immunol	Hara	Hiromitsu
19366357	10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00805.x	Protein-protein interactions: a simple strategy to identify binding sites and peptide antagonists.	Secondary structure motifs and small protein domains can act as building blocks that are isolated and investigated to gain insights into protein global structure but can also modulate interactions with external partners. Most progress has been made in this field using synthetic peptides. Fragmentation of folded proteins by proteolytic enzymes that act preferentially on exposed and less structured sites can help to isolate shorter polypeptides with preserved secondary and tertiary structures that mimic the original protein architecture. Such molecules can be used as probes for structural studies and as tools for in vitro assays to select active fragments useful as agonists or antagonists of the original protein or as scaffolds for the design of more potent and selective ligands. This simple but effective proteolytic methodology has been successfully applied to determine antagonists of protein-protein interactions, allowing the identification of inhibitors with high efficacy and specificity. Here, we present several studies including the complex between phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes and phospholipase 1, believed to play a relevant role in the insulin resistance mechanism in phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes-overexpressing tissues, the self-association of BCL10 caspase recruitment domain that mediates a protein oligomerization process responsible for NF-kappaB activation and the self-association of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible factor 45 beta, a major player of the endogenous NF-kappaB-mediated resistance to apoptosis.	2009	07	17	Chem Biol Drug Des	Sandomenico	Annamaria
19385974	10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01139.x	Antibodies to Helicobacter pylori and CagA protein are associated with the response to antibacterial therapy in patients with H. pylori-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric MALT lymphoma.	The aim of this study was to clarify predictive factors for response to eradication therapy in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Sixty-six patients who were examined for H. pylori infection and the presence of the API2-MALT1 chimeric transcript and who underwent H. pylori eradication therapy as first-line therapy, were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemical markers (p53, Ki-67, and BCL10), microsatellite instability, loss of heterozygosity, serum levels of antibodies (anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA), and markers for gastritis (gastrin and pepsinogens) were examined, and the results were compared between patients whose tumors regressed completely after eradication therapy (responders) and patients whose tumors did not regress (non-responders). Of the 66 patients with localized gastric MALT lymphoma, 47 (71.2%) showed complete remission after eradication therapy. None of the H. pylori-negative (n = 9) and/or API2-MALT1-positive (n = 7) patients responded to antibacterial treatment. Of 44 patients with H. pylori-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric MALT lymphoma, 38 (86.4%) showed complete remission after eradication therapy. Titers of antibodies against H. pylori and CagA protein were significantly higher in the responders than in the non-responders (P = 0.0235 and 0.0089, respectively). No significant difference between the groups was observed for the other factors. In conclusion, measurement of titers of serum antibodies to H. pylori and CagA protein may be useful for predicting the response to eradication therapy in patients with H. pylori-positive API2-MALT1-negative gastric MALT lymphoma.	2009	07	08	Cancer Sci	Sumida	Tomonori
19428562	10.1016/j.imlet.2009.03.005	Barley-derived beta-D-glucan induces immunostimulation via a dectin-1-mediated pathway.	Barley-derived beta-glucan, a linear mixed-linkage beta-glucan composed of 1,3- and 1,4-beta-D-glucopyranose polymers, binds to dectin-1. However, whether it can trigger signal transduction via dectin-1 remains unclear. In this study, we used a reporter gene assay to determine whether barley-derived beta-d-glucan can activate NF-kappaB via dectin-1-mediated signaling when dectin-1 is cotransfected with Syk, CARD9, and Bcl10 in 293T cells. We found that barley-derived beta-D-glucan can activate NF-kappaB leading to cytokine production when dectin-1, Syk, CARD9, and Bcl10 are coexpressed in the cells. We also found that barley-derived beta-D-glucan can induce the phosphorylation of Syk and production of IL-6 in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. These results indicated that the immunostimulatory effects of barley-derived beta-d-glucan might be exerted, at least in part, via dectin-1.	2009	08	17	Immunol Lett	Tada	Rui
19444310	10.1038/embor.2009.64	COP9 signalosome controls the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 complex upon T-cell stimulation.	The Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex connects T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling to the canonical IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF (nuclear factor)-kappaB pathway. Earlier studies have indicated that the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a pleiotropic regulator of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system, controls antigen responses in T cells. The CSN is required for the degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha, but other molecular targets involved in T-cell signalling remained elusive. Here, we identify the CSN subunit 5 (CSN5) as a new interactor of Malt1 and Carma1. T-cell activation triggers the recruitment of the CSN to the CBM complex, and CSN downregulation impairs TCR-induced IKK activation. Furthermore, the CSN is required for maintaining the stability of Bcl10 in response to T-cell activation. Taken together, our data provide evidence for a functional link between the evolutionarily conserved CSN and the adaptive immunoregulatory CBM complex in T cells.	2009	08	13	EMBO Rep	Welteke	Verena
19454668	10.4049/jimmunol.0900498	CARMA1 controls an early checkpoint in the thymic development of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.	Natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) that develop in the thymus are essential to limit immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. However, the steps necessary for their thymic development are incompletely understood. The CARMA1/Bcl10/Malt1 (CBM) complex, comprised of adaptors that link the TCR to the transcription factor NF-kappaB, is required for development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) but not conventional T cells. Current models propose that TCR-NF-kappaB is needed in a Treg-extrinsic manner for IL-2 production by conventional T cells or in already precommitted Treg precursors for driving IL-2/STAT5 responsiveness and further maturation into Tregs and/or for promoting cell survival. Using CARMA1-knockout mice, our data show instead that the CBM complex is needed in a Treg-intrinsic rather than -extrinsic manner. Constitutive activity of STAT5 or protection from apoptosis by transgenic expression of Bcl2 in developing Tregs is not sufficient to rescue CARMA1-knockout Treg development. Instead, our results demonstrate that the CBM complex controls an early checkpoint in Treg development by enabling generation of thymic precursors of Tregs. These data suggest a modified model of nTreg development in which TCR-CBM-dependent signals are essential to commit immature thymocytes to the nTreg lineage.	2009	06	22	J Immunol	Molinero	Luciana L

19494296	10.4049/jimmunol.0803313	A20 negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling to NF-kappaB by cleaving Malt1 ubiquitin chains.	The Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 signaling module bridges TCR signaling to the canonical IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway. Covalent attachment of regulatory ubiquitin chains to Malt1 paracaspase directs TCR signaling to IKK activation. Further, the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 was recently suggested to suppress T cell activation, but molecular targets for A20 remain elusive. In this paper, we show that A20 regulates the strength and duration of the IKK/NF-kappaB response upon TCR/CD28 costimulation. By catalyzing the removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains from Malt1, A20 prevents sustained interaction between ubiquitinated Malt1 and the IKK complex and thus serves as a negative regulator of inducible IKK activity. Upon T cell stimulation, A20 is rapidly removed and paracaspase activity of Malt1 has been suggested to cleave A20. Using antagonistic peptides or reconstitution of Malt1(-/-) T cells, we show that Malt1 paracaspase activity is required for A20 cleavage and optimal IL-2 production, but dispensable for initial IKK/NF-kappaB signaling in CD4(+) T cells. However, proteasomal inhibition impairs A20 degradation and impedes TCR/CD28-induced IKK activation. Taken together, A20 functions as a Malt1 deubiquitinating enzyme and proteasomal degradation and de novo synthesis of A20 contributes to balance TCR/CD28-induced IKK/NF-kappaB signaling.	2009	06	25	J Immunol	Düwel	Michael
19535128	10.1016/j.humpath.2009.02.018	Primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the gallbladder: report of a case harboring API2/MALT1 gene fusion.	The genetic alterations underlying extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type are heterogeneous and show variation according to the tumor site. Here, we report a case of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the gallbladder with genetic characterization. This lymphoma, diagnosed in a 75-year-old woman who underwent cholecystectomy for suspected acute cholecystitis, presented as diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall. The morphology was typical of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and by immunophenotype, the tumor cells were CD20+ CD5- CD10- CD23- CD43- BCL6- BCL2+ IgM+ IgD- lambda+, with moderate nuclear expression of BCL10.

19538180	10.1042/BJ20090055	Generation and functional characterization of a BCL10-inhibitory peptide that represses NF-kappaB activation.	The molecular complex containing BCL10 and CARMA [CARD (caspase recruitment domain)-containing MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase)] proteins has recently been identified as a key component in the signal transduction pathways that regulate activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. Assembly of complexes containing BCL10 and CARMA proteins relies on homophilic interactions established between the CARDs of these proteins. In order to identify BCL10-inhibitory peptides, we have established a method of assaying peptides derived from the CARD of BCL10 in binding competition assays of CARD-CARD self-association. By this procedure, a short peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 91-98 of BCL10 has been selected as an effective inhibitor of protein self-association. When tested in cell assays for its capacity to block NF-kappaB activation, this peptide represses activation of NF-kappaB mediated by BCL10, CARMA3 and PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Collectively, these results indicate that residues 91-98 of BCL10 are involved in BCL10 self-association and also participate in the interaction with external partners. We also show that blocking of the CARD of BCL10 may potentially be used for the treatment of pathological conditions associated with inappropriate NF-kappaB activation.	2009	09	16	Biochem J	Marasco	Daniela

Familial aggregation, linkage and case-control studies support the role of germline genes in the aetiology of lymphoid malignancies. To further examine the role of genetic variation underlying susceptibility, we analysed 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 152 genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair, immune response and oxidative stress pathways among a unique sample of 165 unrelated familial cases including patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and 107 spouse controls. We confirmed previous studies showing a polymorphism in the IL10 promoter (rs1800890/-3575T&gt;A) to be associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as this allele was found to be associated with both CLL and WM. We also confirmed the role of IL6 variation to be associated with HL. Polymorphisms in TNFSF10 were associated with both CLL and WM. Future replication and functional studies are needed to clarify the role of these genetic variants. Finally, our data further support the close association of WM and CLL.	2009	09	10	Br J Haematol	Liang	Xueying Sharon
19576081		[A clinical study of chromosome translocations in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in Chinese patients].	To investigate the genetic aberrations in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas from different sites of the body in Chinese patients. Two hundred and seventeen paraffin-embedded MALT lymphoma specimens from 11 major sites were studied with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect t (11; 18) (q21; q21)/API2-MALT1, t (1; 14) (p22; q32)/IGH-BCL10, (14; 18) (q32; q21)/IGH-MALT1 and BCL6 gene involved chromosome translocations. These translocations were mutually exclusive and detected in 21% (46/217) of the cases, including t (11; 18) (q21; q21) API2-MALT1 13% (29/217), t (1; 14) (p22; q32) IGH-BCL10 in 1% (3/217), t (14; 18) (q32; q21) IGH-MALT1 1% (2/217), BCL6 involved translocation in 2% (4/217) and IGH-unknown translocation partner in 4% (8/217). t (11; 18) (q21; q21) API2-MALT1 was found with the highest frequency in MALT lymphoma from lungs (47%, 8/17) and small intestine (29%, 4/14), followed by salivary gland (17%, 1/6), stomach (14%, 12/84) and ocular adnexae (6%, 4/68). t (1; 14) (p22; q32) was only detected in lungs (12%, 2/17) and stomach (1%, 1/84). t (14; 18) (q32; q21) was mainly detected in lungs (6%, 1/17) and ocular adnexae (2%, 1/68). BCL6 gene involved translocation was detected in salivary gland (17%, 1/6) and stomach (4%, 3/84). It is demonstrated that the four translocations occur with markedly variable frequencies in MALT lymphoma of different sites in Chinese patients. The distributions of these chromosome translocations in Chinese patients are slightly different from those reported in western patients.	2009	10	01	Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi	Dong	Ge-Hong
19608748	10.1182/blood-2009-03-208215	Mice deficient for CD137 ligand are predisposed to develop germinal center-derived B-cell lymphoma.	In the germinal center (GC), B cells proliferate dramatically and diversify their immunoglobulin genes, which increases the risk of malignant transformation. The GC B-cell reaction relies on crosstalk with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), to which the costimulatory receptor CD137 on FDCs and its ligand on GC B cells potentially contribute. We report that mice deficient for CD137 ligand (CD137L) are predisposed to develop B-cell lymphoma, with an incidence of approximately 60% at 12 months of age. Lymphoma membrane markers were characteristic of GC B cells. Longitudinal histologic analysis identified the GC as site of oncogenic transformation and classified 85% of the malignancies found in approximately 200 mice as GC-derived B-cell lymphoma. To delineate the mechanism underlying lymphomagenesis, gene expression profiles of wild-type and CD137L-deficient GC B cells were compared. CD137L deficiency was associated with enhanced expression of a limited gene set that included Bcl-10 and the GC response regulators Bcl-6, Spi-B, Elf-1, Bach2, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Among these are proto-oncogenes that mediate GC B-cell lymphoma development in humans. We conclude that CD137L ordinarily regulates the GC B-cell response and thereby acts as a tumor suppressor.	2009	09	29	Blood	Middendorp	Sabine

Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are rare neoplasms. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these tumors. The BCL10 gene, a proapoptotic signaling molecule involved in the Apaf-1/caspase-9 cell death pathway, may act as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple types of tumors including testicular GCTs. To evaluate whether alterations in the BCL10 gene play a role in the genesis of intracranial GCTs, we analyzed the BCL10 gene in 10 pure germinomas (PGs) and 10 nongerminomatous GCTs. We found no inactivating mutations; however, 5 of 10 PGs and 1 of 10 nongerminomatous GCTs manifested specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that carried an amino acid substitution at codon 5 in exon 1 or codon 162 in exon 3. This SNP occurs at higher frequency in patients with PGs than healthy individuals (p = 0.07). CSF dissemination occurred in 4 of our 6 patients manifesting SNP (p = 0.037). Our data suggest that this specific SNP in the BCL10 gene may be partly responsible for the tumorigenesis of PG in Japanese individuals, and may be associated with the aggressive nature of these tumors.	2010	05	20	Pediatr Neurosurg	Hayashi	Yutaka
19696203	10.1182/blood-2008-12-192583	Emu-BCL10 mice exhibit constitutive activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways generating marginal zone (MZ) B-cell expansion as a precursor to splenic MZ lymphoma.	BCL10, required for nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation during antigen-driven lymphocyte responses, is aberrantly expressed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type marginal zone (MZ) lymphomas because of chromosomal translocations. Emu-driven human BCL10 transgenic (Tg) mice, which we created and characterize here, had expanded populations of MZ B cells and reduced follicular and B1a cells. Splenic B cells from Tg mice exhibited constitutive activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways is associated with increased expression of NF-kappaB target genes. These genes included Tnfsf13b, which encodes the B-cell activating factor (BAFF). In addition, levels of BAFF were significantly increased in sera from Tg mice. MZ B cells of Tg mice exhibited reduced turnover in vivo and enhanced survival in vitro, indicative of lymphoaccumulation rather than lymphoproliferation as the cause of MZ expansion. In vivo antibody responses to both T-independent, and especially T-dependent, antigens were significantly reduced in Tg mice. Mortality was accelerated in Tg animals, and some mice older than 8 months had histologic and molecular findings indicative of clonal splenic MZ lymphoma. These results suggest that, in addition to constitutive activation of BCL10 in MZ B cells, other genetic factors or environmental influences are required for short latency oncogenic transformation.	2009	12	03	Blood	Li	Zhaoyang
19709433	10.1186/1476-4598-8-67	STAT5 regulation of BCL10 parallels constitutive NFkappaB activation in lymphoid tumor cells.	Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 A and B (STAT5) are key survival factors in cells of the lymphoid lineage. Identification of novel, tissue-specific STAT5 regulated genes would advance the ability to combat diseases due to aberrant STAT5 signaling. In the present work a library of human STAT5 bound genomic elements was created and validated. Of several STAT5 responsive genomic regulatory elements identified, one was located within the first intron of the human BCL10 gene. Chromatin immuno-precipitation reactions confirmed constitutive in vivo STAT5 binding to this intronic fragment in various human lymphoid tumor cell lines. Interestingly, non-phosphorylated STAT5 was found in the nuclei of Kit225 and YT cells in the absence of cytokine stimulation that paralleled constitutive NFkappaB activation. Inhibition of the hyperactive JAK3/STAT5 pathway in MT-2 cells via the Mannich-base, NC1153, diminished the constitutive in vivo occupancy of BCL10-SBR by STAT5, reduced NFkappaB activity and BCL10 protein expression in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, depletion of STAT5 via selective antisense oligonucleotide treatment similarly resulted in decreased BCL10 mRNA and protein expression, cellular viability and impaired NFkappaB activity independent of IL-2. These results suggest that the NFkappaB regulator BCL10 is an IL-2-independent STAT5 target gene. These findings proffer a model in which un-activated STAT5 can regulate pathways critical for lymphoid cell survival and inhibitors that disrupt STAT5 function independent of tyrosine phosphorylation may be therapeutically effective in treating certain leukemias/lymphomas.	2010	02	17	Mol Cancer	Nagy	Zsuzsanna S
19773279	10.1136/oem.2008.044024	Association between genetic variants in VEGF, ERCC3 and occupational benzene haematotoxicity.	Benzene is an established human haematotoxin, with substantial interindividual variation in benzene-induced toxicity. To further examine if genetic variation contributes to benzene haematotoxicity, we analysed 1023 tagSNPs in 121 gene regions important for benzene metabolism, haematopoiesis, leukaemia and lymphoma among 250 workers exposed to benzene and 140 unexposed controls in a cross-sectional study carried out in China. Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and total white blood cell (WBC) count and its subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders and occupational exposure to benzene and toluene among exposed workers. The minp test assessed the association on the gene region level. The false discovery rate method was used to control for multiple comparisons. VEGF (minp = 0.0030) and ERCC3 (minp = 0.0042) were the most significantly associated gene regions with altered WBC counts among benzene-exposed workers, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Highly significant changes were also found for WBC subtype counts, including granulocytes, CD4+ T cells and lymphocytes for VEGF and granulocytes and NK cells for ERCC3. Further, in workers exposed to &lt;1 ppm, a SNP in VEGF was associated with changes in WBC and granulocyte counts, and SNPs in ERCC3 were associated with changes in WBC, NK cell and granulocyte counts. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in VEGF, which plays an important role in blood vessel growth, and ERCC3, which is a member of the DNA repair pathway and is responsible for repairing bulky DNA adducts formed by chemicals, may contribute to individual susceptibility to benzene-induced haematotoxicity at relatively low levels of benzene exposure.	2010	01	04	Occup Environ Med	Hosgood	H D
19841089	10.1084/jem.20091167	Inhibition of MALT1 protease activity is selectively toxic for activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of lymphoma in humans. The aggressive activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is characterized by constitutive NF-kappaB activity and requires signals from CARD11, BCL10, and the paracaspase MALT1 for survival. CARD11, BCL10, and MALT1 are scaffold proteins that normally associate upon antigen receptor ligation. Signal-induced CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complexes couple upstream events to IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB activation. MALT1 also possesses a recently recognized proteolytic activity that cleaves and inactivates the negative NF-kappaB regulator A20 and BCL10 upon antigen receptor ligation. Yet, the relevance of MALT1 proteolytic activity for malignant cell growth is unknown. Here, we demonstrate preassembled CBM complexes and constitutive proteolysis of the two known MALT1 substrates in ABC-DLBCL, but not in germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL. ABC-DLBCL cell treatment with a MALT1 protease inhibitor blocks A20 and BCL10 cleavage, reduces NF-kappaB activity, and decreases the expression of NF-kappaB targets genes. Finally, MALT1 paracaspase inhibition results in death and growth retardation selectively in ABC-DLBCL cells. Thus, our results indicate a growth-promoting role for MALT1 paracaspase activity in ABC-DLBCL and suggest that a pharmacological MALT1 protease inhibition could be a promising approach for lymphoma treatment.	2009	11	16	J Exp Med	Ferch	Uta
